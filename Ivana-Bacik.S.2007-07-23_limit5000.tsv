House prices are now higher than the Celtic tiger peak yet the Government's building targets remain too low. It is four months since the Taoiseach admitted to me in Leaders’ Questions that more ambition would be needed. Instead of Housing for All, it seems we are still stuck with housing just for some. Those struggling to find an affordable home to rent must continue to compete with short-term tourist lettings. It is five years since the Oireachtas first debated a Labour Bill to regulate Airbnb-style lets. Now we understand that the European Commission is still delaying a decision on the Government's proposal to do just that. The Government needs to remind the Commission how dire the housing crisis is here and let it know of the urgency. We cannot afford to wait any longer for EU proposals. For years, we have called for stronger regulation of short-term letting. We know how many homes these platforms take out of use because, during the pandemic, suddenly they all became available. That situation has now been allowed to worsen again. ""Building back better"" post Covid has made its way out of the lexicon. Instead, prospective buyers and renters are being victimised by a profit-driven market, and  Renters in Ireland are still at the whim of landlords. There has been no tangible strengthening of renters' rights since the general election. No-fault evictions are still taking place, even though we in Labour proposed a Bill to stop them. While inspections in the private rented sector have gone up since the pandemic, enforcement is practically non-existent in many areas. Not a single prohibition notice was issued in ten local authority areas last year. Homelessness figures will be out tomorrow, and no one is under any illusion that there will be good news this month. Every day, across the country, tenants live in fear of the dreaded call to tell them they will be losing their home. It is a Wild West for renters out there.

Her article makes for chilling reading. Undoubtedly, there are issues with the arbitrary deductions from workers wages and workplace practices. To return to the issue of Godart's treatment of his tenants, what is the Government going to do to ensure unscrupulous landlords like Godart will be made accountable and that there would be some comeback? Clearly, neither local authorities nor the Residential Tenancies Board currently have the power or capacity to regulate the undoubtedly small number of egregious abuses in the rental sector. Will the Tánaiste bolster the RTB to crack down on those who are exploiting tenants? Clearly, they are not representative of the vast majority of landlords, but right now, the RTB investigations and sanctions unit can only levy fines of up to €15,000. That is not enough to deal people like Godart. In the nineties, we saw how the Labour Party Minister for Finance, Ruairí Quinn, created the Criminal Assets Bureau to go after the assets of criminals, seizing property and going after ill-gotten cash. We now need an enforcement mechanism within the RTB with real powers to go after the small number of unscrupulous landlords who are making life a misery for far too many. Reading Naomi O'Leary's piece, all of us will recall that these are practices from 19th century Land League times. This was why the Land League was set up, calling for fair rent, fixity of tenure and decent conditions for renters. We are seeing some appalling conditions still prevailing for renters in Dublin and across the country today.	spk_191

Roughly one life has been lost every other day since the new year. This is a shocking figure. We see that fewer than 5% of people told to hand over their learner permit following conviction for a road traffic offence comply with the law. Will the Government take on a stronger role in ensuring road safety measures are put in place? Will it act also on the safety of transport workers? This week, SIPTU revealed that a staggering 80% of transport workers had reported having suffered abuse at work. Last year, I sought plans from the Ministers for Transport and Justice to ensure measures on road safety would be put in place and to ensure safety for transport workers, but I heard then that no specific data was collected on assaults on transport workers and that safety measures were matters for individual operators, not for the Government. Can we see a change in policy for transport workers' safety, and particularly for road safety for all of us?	spk_215

Upon taking office in December 2022, the Taoiseach's stated aim was to make Ireland the best country in which to be a child and to improve well-being and opportunity for children. However, there are many children in Ireland today who are being failed by the State. I am talking about children who are denied care in our health system, who are waiting for surgery, who are lost in mental health services or who are not receiving the care and support they so badly need. No parent wants to make public the private pain of their son or daughter, but we are seeing so many who are utterly desperate. Some parents have even been driven to posting videos on social media of their young children sobbing with pain through the night in a desperate effort to secure appropriate healthcare. Those videos are harrowing. It is even more harrowing to meet the parents and the children and hear their stories. As we know, in 2017, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, made a commitment that no child would be made to wait more than four months for surgery. Yet, children are still waiting longer for spina bifida or scoliosis surgery than was the case when the Government took office. As my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, said in the debate last night, 78% of children are waiting longer than Sláintecare target times for paediatric and orthopaedic inpatient appointments and 81% are waiting longer than that target for inpatient urology services. There are also the outpatient waiting lists. Let us look at the children's mental health services. Yesterday, we heard yesterday from the Children’s Rights Alliance that, for the third year in a row, the Government deserves only an E grade, an unacceptable grade, in respect of access to children's mental health services. Four years ago, the Government made a commitment to end the admission of children to adult psychiatric wards. Yet despite successive damning reports from the Mental Health Commission, children’s ombudsman, and others, the Government has apparently rowed back on that important commitment. The Department of Health has acknowledged that in some cases children with mental health problems will continue to be admitted to inappropriate wards. Last year, 50% of children were unjustifiably admitted to such wards because there were no beds available in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, units. We know that almost a third of in-patient CAMHS beds were not operational in 2023 due to staff shortages. The waiting list for a first appointment for CAMHS stood at almost 4,000 in July 2023. This is a national disgrace. On so many fronts, we are seeing vulnerable children let down by State health services. It appears that the Government has quietly abandoned commitments it made on children's health. It is not good enough to say that it may take two successive Government terms to recover this. I heard that the Taoiseach saying that in a response earlier. There are things the Government can do now. The Irish Hospital Consultants Association has pointed to staff shortages as a real factor in driving unacceptable delays for services relating to children. Will the Government end the recruitment freeze and the embargo relating to certain grades in the health service. Will it move to tackle the outrageous waiting lists and address the failings in CAMHS that have been made so glaringly obvious in so many reports, including that from Children's Rights Alliance yesterday.	spk_77

However, I repeat that it is just not good enough for the Taoiseach to say it will take two Governments to resolve issues with children's health in Ireland. He is in government and has been for many years now and it is not good enough that we are still seeing these waiting lists. Let us look at facts. The Irish Hospital Consultants Association tells us the difficulty with filling permanent consultant posts is a root cause of what it in its words are ""unacceptably long"" child waiting lists. In August last year the association told us over 100,000 children and young people were on hospital waiting lists with 20,600 children waiting longer than a year for treatment or assessment by a hospital consultant. The latest HSE data reveals the number of unfilled permanent consultant posts has risen to a record 933 and the Irish Hospital Consultants Association says this is the highest consultant vacancy rate ever. These are the facts, just as there are facts on the admission of children to adult psychiatric units. A commitment was made by the Taoiseach's Government four years ago to end this practice yet we see 50% of those children admitted to an adult unit last year. This was done because no bed was available in a CAMHS unit. There are unacceptable waiting lists for CAMHS services. There are the facts and the Taoiseach's Government has simply not done enough to address them."	spk_79

The news of his untimely death is very sad. I join the call for a debate this week on the aspect of the Children’s Rights Alliance report referred to. This is the third consecutive year in which the Government has received an E grade - an unacceptable grade - in respect of children’s mental health issues. In particular, the report highlights the waiting lists for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and the continued practice of having children kept on adult psychiatric wards. That is a failing in the context of one of the commitments contained in the programme for Government. I remind the House that this time last year the biggest news story was the report into CAMHS showing that children and young people had been lost in the mental health system. In one catchment area, 140 so-called lost cases were found within the local CAMHS team. I have the Minister for Health’s statement from January 2023 in which he told the House that the issues with CAMHS were not acceptable and that he was treating them as a priority. One year on, with another E grade from the Children’s Rights Alliance, we need time this week for a debate.	spk_32

However, there are many areas where we can do better. We boast generations of talented writers and artists, many of whom have had to leave these shores to have their work seen and heard. The work of many who are here and are contributing so much to news coverage and the creation of content here at home is desperately undervalued by our national broadcaster. Far too many of those who keep the lights on and the cameras rolling at RTÉ are denied a fair wage, a pension, holidays and maternity leave because they are trapped on bogus self-employment contracts. That is the reality. These workers' rights issues are not receiving enough scrutiny. Instead, our time is preoccupied by what our colleague, Senator Marie Sherlock, has rightly described as the upstairs-downstairs culture that prevails at RTÉ and the indefensible conduct of a few at the top. Yesterday’s committee appearances confirmed that. People were rightly shocked at the revelation that the former director general of RTÉ signed off on a €450,000 retirement payment for the former chief financial officer, Breda O’Keeffe. People are also shocked when they compare this extraordinary outlay with RTÉ's decision to spend tens of thousands of euro appealing findings made by the Department of Social Protection on bogus self-employment practices at the station. Those who are most demoralised by the revelations of the past year, the revelations of secret golden handshakes, are the staff on the ground who are paying for the very flaithiúlach approach being taken by those at the top to the resources of a struggling public body. We all want to move on and focus on issues such as the workers' rights I have mentioned and, crucially, the key issue of the future funding model for the broadcaster, which the Government has not yet answered. The Government and RTÉ also have questions to answer about the past conduct of those at the top. The Tánaiste said just now that there must be transparency and accountability and he said earlier today that the exit package given to Breda O’Keeffe should be reassessed. Indeed, he suggested she might consider paying back excessive amounts. However, this is not just about one individual’s retirement deal. I think the Tánaiste agrees with that. We know there are others. RTÉ's former director of strategy, Rory Coveney, also received an exit package when he resigned in July but we do not know the value of that payment or what it was for. When asked, a spokesperson said that RTÉ could not provide more information. We know that everybody wants to turn over a new leaf and focus on real issues but that cannot happen while public money is apparently still being spent sustaining the bad culture of old and fighting those who are bearing the brunt of this crisis at the Workplace Relations Commission or the High Court. Can the Tánaiste say how the Government is going to go about achieving that accountability and transparency he has said is so badly needed? While we in the Labour Party absolutely support decent investment in public service broadcasting, and pay our TV licences, we still need to know how much of the public money going into the national broadcaster has been spent covering the costs of yet another lucrative exit package and how much has been spent fighting the rights of workers who are struggling at the bottom of the system in RTÉ.	spk_248

Indeed, there are very serious issues for workers at levels below those top management levels at RTÉ. Trevor Keegan, chair of the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, group at RTÉ said today that the impending redundancies at RTÉ loom large and that the prospect is impacting morale among staff at all levels below top management. The Tánaiste is right about that. When will we see results? When will we see an outcome from the Minister's review? When will we see actual improvement in conditions for those who are currently on those bogus self-employed contracts, those who are incorrectly being described by RTÉ as contractors when they are actually staff? When will see certainty and clarity for staff on their future? That relies on a future funding model and we have not got clarity from the Government in that regard. The Tánaiste has said he wants transparency and accountability around past conduct and payments made to those at the top. We still have a real lack of information and clarity about the payments made to others, beyond Breda O'Keeffe. Kevin Bakhurst took up his position on Monday, 10 July. Rory Coveney announced his resignation on Sunday, 9 July.We still have no clarity about exit payments in this regard, nor about exit payments to others at the top level in RTÉ. We need to know from the Government what it is going to do about it.	spk_250

Gaza is one of the most densely populated areas in the world and under Israeli bombardment, its people have been brutally displaced and forced into ever more cramped and overcrowded spaces, most recently into Rafah. They are still being bombarded, even now in Rafah. We are witnessing Armageddon. There is nowhere left for a desperate civilian population to go in Gaza.On 7 October, we saw the horrific Hamas attack on Israel and since 7 October, we have seen the loss of civilian life in Gaza on an unthinkable and unconscionable scale. In recent days, we heard the heartbreaking audio of the last hours of six-year-old Hind Rajab, pleading for help hours before she and her two rescuers were killed by Israeli fire, along with five members of her family. Back in October, the Dáil voted to call for a ceasefire. In doing so, we were one of the first parliaments in the world to make that call but while making calls is important, it is taking action that counts. As long as Ireland delays taking further meaningful steps to put an end to the genocide in Gaza, our complicity in what is happening there is prolonged. There is so much more that the Government can and should be doing, and it would have the support of the Opposition in doing so. For the  While I acknowledge the Taoiseach’s engagement on measures such as the recognition of Palestinian statehood, it is not good enough to say “Wait a little longer”. How long must people in Gaza wait? The death toll is mounting, starvation is setting in and disease is spreading there. We in Ireland must take further action. We must move on legislation to stop Ireland from subsidising genocide and to end trade with occupied territories in Palestine. The Government has said it would prefer to take action on these issues by non-legislative means but there are perfectly good Bills waiting to be passed. I have received a legal opinion which indicates that the occupied territories Bill, initiated by Senator Frances Black, is possible to pass under EU law, so let us do it. Let us move to pass the occupied territories Bill. Will the Taoiseach commit to doing so? At the next European Council meeting, will he press for the suspension of the EU-Israel trade association agreement? We need to do more than call for a ceasefire. There is a solid view on both sides of this House that we need to take action now. We are hearing from so many people across the country of their utter distress and horror at the genocide unfolding before our eyes. We cannot sit back and be complicit.	spk_5

It was important that the Dáil and the Government called for a ceasefire and that the Taoiseach and his Government colleagues defended UNRWA when other countries were not doing so, and we acknowledge that from the Opposition. I am glad to hear the Taoiseach spoke yesterday with the President of the EU Commission on the EU-Israel trade agreement, but we need to do more. The Taoiseach has spoken previously in the House on working with like-minded EU member states on seeking to press further at EU level. What actions are ongoing? With which EU member states is the Government working? We understand Belgium may be one. Now is the time for us to see further action being taken. The Taoiseach stated that Israel is not listening, but it will have to listen if enough countries in the West which currently support it withdraw their support. I am thinking in particular of the US and EU countries, with which Ireland has influence. It is possible for the Taoiseach and the Government to use their influence to a higher and stronger degree as otherwise, we are all complicit in sitting and watching an Armageddon unfold and children such as young Hind Rajab continuing to suffer and die under our watch and that of the world.

Today’s bad news comes from the latest report of the Residential Tenancies Board, and there is no explaining away the stark figures it presents. The report shows that renters are now being hit with rent hikes of more than double the legal caps in some rent pressure zones. Between quarter 3 of 2022 and quarter 3 of 2023, we see existing tenants suffering averages rises of 5.2% and new tenants seeing rental cost rises of more than five times the legal limits in rent pressure zones. In Dublin, my own constituency has a much higher than average proportion of households in rental so this is something that affects people across my constituency. Across Dublin as a whole, the average rent for new tenancies is now €2,113 per month, an increase of 10% year on year between quarter 3 of 2022 and the same quarter in 2023, and 18% more than the average rent for existing tenants in Dublin. Existing tenants pay, on average, €1,788 per month in Dublin, up 4.3% year on year. In Cork, the Minister's own area, new tenants now pay an average of €1,386 per month, an increase of 8.8% year on year, while existing tenants pay an average of €1,170 per month, an increase of 4.5%. Give that rent pressure zones cover so much of the country now, these figures show clearly that there is an issue with flagrant breaches of renting law. Rents should not increase in rent pressure zones by more than the legal cap and yet they are doing so. A home is a basic right. The Government has a duty to ensure people are housed in secure and affordable housing, but these figures tell us the Government has failed in this duty. This failure is having devastating consequences. We are all well aware of this because we all hear from our own constituents about the serious effects of housing distress and the housing crisis. They are plunging people into poverty, harming their health and paralysing their ability to progress their careers or get on with their lives. So often people use words like ""despair"", ""broken"" and ""frightened"" to describe how high rents and a lack of housing security impact their lives.

On behalf of the Labour Party, I wish to extend our sincere sympathies to the family of John Bruton: to his wife, Finola, to their four children, Juliana, Emily, Mary-Elizabeth and Matthew, to his sister, Mary, and, of course, to his brother and our colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton. We are so sorry for your loss. I extend our sympathies also to the extended family, friends and colleagues of John Bruton in Fine Gael and to his former constituents and supporters in Meath, the constituency he represented for over three decades, an extraordinary legacy of public service. Indeed, John Bruton leaves a significant legacy of public service not just in Meath but nationally and at European level too. Many stories have been told about him over the past day since the sad news of his death, and any independent observer of Irish coalition Governments throughout the 1980s and 1990s would fairly say that on many economic and social issues, John Bruton and the Labour Party did not agree. Indeed, there were fundamental disagreements, and I think John Bruton would have been the first to acknowledge that, probably with his famous big, booming laugh. Like many others, I have heard so many stories about that famous laugh and I heard it myself on a number of occasions. Many others have spoken about his courtesy and good humour and I think that is also a very fair and genuine observation. He was a conservative, as has been said, and a very principled public representative of the Christian democratic tradition. This created many difficulties for the Labour Party at the time and for the Labour Party now, which comes from a very different, social democratic and trade union tradition. Both sides, however, as we know, did work together and John Bruton, working with Dick Spring and others in the Labour Party and Democratic Left, made the rainbow coalition a very effective coalition Government. Others have spoken, notably the Minister, Deputy Ryan, about how that rainbow coalition set a model and precedent for three-party coalition governments or, indeed, for coalition governments. The politics and policies of the rainbow Government undoubtedly went on to fundamentally change Ireland economically and socially and generations have benefited from the policies of that relatively short-lived Government in so many ways, including through the peace process, which others have mentioned. The return of power-sharing at Stormont over the weekend really puts into perspective the work John Bruton, Dick Spring and others in that Government pursued to reinvigorate the peace process with the Anglo-Irish framework documents and how they had to pick up the pieces, as we might recall, after the IRA returned to violence with the bombing of Canary Wharf and the awful murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. These were enormous challenges they were able to address and overcome. Over 25 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, I think we can acknowledge that John Bruton and that Government played a key role in laying the groundwork for the peace and stability that we now have across this island. Indeed, more recently, John Bruton, as we know, was very aware of the destabilising impact of Brexit and was a vocal critic of the negative impact any return to a hard border would have on the island. Apart from the peace process, the rainbow Government left an important economic legacy in laying the groundwork for prosperity and ending the scourge of large deficits, of unemployment and of mass emigration that had plagued the island throughout the 1980s. During the rainbow coalition years, there was also important social change, and others have spoken about the divorce referendum.For many years, the Labour Party had sought to introduce the right to remarry. As Taoiseach, John Bruton played a pivotal role in securing what was really the first great constitutional liberalisation, when the second divorce referendum was finally passed by a narrow majority in 1995. John Bruton served as EU ambassador to the US from 2004 to 2009. He used his political skills to build and grow relationships with members of the US Congress. Of course, he did not really retire even following that because he remained active in public life, particularly when it came to Irish-British relationships and EU affairs. To his colleagues in Fine Gael, I extend our sympathy. For us in the Labour Party and for many others, we will always wonder what the great counterfactual of modern Irish history would have been, namely, how things might have been different if that pioneering, Rainbow Government had been re-elected in 1997. I have heard others say that one of John Bruton's biggest political regrets was that that tripartite coalition Government was not re-elected in 1997. Despite that of course, he leaves an enduring legacy. Again, on behalf of the Labour Party, I extend our deepest sympathies to his family, friends and colleagues.	spk_13

VHI premiums will rise by an average of 7% from 1 March. That hike comes on top of two previous increases in March and October of last year. It means people who have private health insurance with VHI will have to front up anywhere from an additional €180 up to nearly €700 for just one year. Families may expect an increase of between €400 up to nearly €600 at a time when so many families are struggling with rising cost of living issues. In a country with a well-functioning public health system, this might not be such a huge news story because in other countries, it might be a price increase affecting just a small minority of people but in this country, nearly 2.4 million people have health insurance policies. This is nearly half the population. The reality is that many others just cannot afford the cost of private healthcare. Compare our level of additional private health coverage to that of other OECD countries. In Portugal and New Zealand, a third of the population has additional voluntary health insurance while in Spain, that figure is much lower at just 15%. In Great Britain, where we so often hear complaints about a beleaguered NHS, only 22% of adults now have private healthcare of this type. Access to affordable quality healthcare is not a luxury nor should it be. Decent care is not something that should be the preserve of those with deeper pockets. For far too long, there has been an over-reliance in Ireland on the private market to counter the failures of and fill the gaps in the public system so we see long waits and delays and heroic health workers working and doing their best in overcrowded settings. I raised the latter issue last week. This affects more than just healthcare for people who are unwell. This week, my colleague Deputy Duncan Smith has been raising concerns about the privatisation of long-term residential care and home care. An ESRI report this month said 15 large private groups now control 38% of the almost 32,000 nursing home beds in the country. That same report says that the Government must better balance the profit incentives of private business with the needs of those receiving care. When will we finally see the Government make that necessary public investment in our healthcare systems? In particular, will the Government put an end to the dangerous recruitment embargo in the HSE? How will it address the projected deficit of 49,000 nurses by 2041, as reported by Sean Murray in today’s 	spk_63

I listened carefully to the Minister's commentary and it sounded to me as if he was observing rather than speaking as a member of the Government. As a member of Government presiding over what has been a good time for the public finances, why have we not seen the level of investment necessary to deliver on public healthcare? The roll-out of Sláintecare has been far too slow. The Minister mentioned that himself.He did not respond to my three specific questions about necessary investment by Government to end the HSE's recruitment embargo. He did not address the projected shortfall of nurses we are seeing, which will cause serious shortfalls in the delivery of healthcare, or address the serious gap in pay for those in the community and voluntary sector who provide much-need home care and community care services - a topic Labour has raised consistently for many months. Our hospitals and acute settings cannot function without that investment by Government in community and voluntary care. I did not hear a response from the Minister to any of those three questions. Proper investment would restore faith and public trust in our healthcare system.	spk_65

Is í tithíocht an cnámh spairne is mó sa Stát. Tá géarghá le níos mó tithíocht a aimsiú agus a thógáil go práinneach ach teastaíonn go leor féinsmachta chuige sin. Níl aon dul chun cinn á dhéanamh. The housing disaster continues to dominate every aspect of Irish life. Last week, we saw new figures on homelessness. Thousands of people, including nearly 4,000 children, are recorded as homeless. Large companies, such as Ryanair, are now resorting to buying up homes for their workforces at scale. Some unscrupulous landlords are acting with impunity. We are seeing the health of renters and local authority tenants suffer due to poor conditions, including mould and damp, with little action or follow-up from inspectors. It is a core function and duty of the State to vindicate the right of everyone who lives here to have decent, secure and affordable housing. In allowing this housing crisis to deepen and worsen, the Government is failing to fulfil that duty, and people across the country are worse off as a result. I want to focus on the rights of tenants. We spoke last week on Leaders' Questions about the respiratory ill-health of council tenants in the Oliver Bond flats. Today I want to talk about the ways in which the State is also failing renters in the private sector. We are all too familiar with the many cases concerning Luxembourg-based landlord Marc Godart. Without commenting on the proceedings against him currently in respect of unpaid rewards by the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, his other recent appearances in the news underscore the need for stronger legal protections for renters. Mr. Godart's tenants have faced the removal of essential furniture, such as beds and doors, to expedite the eviction process. Some were evicted  It is true that some of these outrageous actions have been dealt with by the RTB, which is welcome. However, the bravery of Mr. Godart's tenants in coming forward has prompted other renters to contact me, my Labour Party colleagues and no doubt others in this House to tell those stories of poor treatment by landlords in the private rental sector. Unfortunately, while all these experiences were stark, many did not amount to a breach of our weak legal protections for renters. The Labour Party Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill would have addressed all these problems and more but the Government refuses to pass it or to take anything more than token measures to protect renters. No one should have to live in squalor or insecure housing. As long as the Government continues to fail to deliver enough homes, more and more people will be trapped in rental insecurity.Will the Taoiseach commit to urgently passing stronger legislation to protect renters and will he ramp up delivery of homes? When will the Government act with the necessary ambition and urgency to deliver the supply of houses our renters and all of those who are trapped in insecurity so desperately need? 	spk_7

I think we all welcome it. However, in terms of housing, there is simply not enough progress from Government nor is there enough ambition or urgency in the delivery of housing. I listened carefully to the Taoiseach's response on housing and I am glad that he said that the Government will take Opposition suggestions on board. Two years ago, we put forward a Bill to protect renters and provide for greater legal security for renters. The Government has not worked with us to progress that Bill. We are again asking the Taoiseach to do so to ensure stronger protections for renters because that is an essential part of addressing the housing crisis. It is a crisis that is biting and affecting every household. Every one of us has had experience of meeting constituents and people coming up to us on the street - it happened to me again at the weekend out canvassing - and telling us ,""I may be okay but my adult children will never be able to afford a home in Dublin in the current circumstances."" That is what is driving people to emigrate. That is what is thwarting and stunting people's growth and development - the growth and development of our younger generation. We are simply not seeing the sort of delivery. Even in respect of the Taoiseach's figures, just one in 50 of the 6,300 applications for the vacant property refurbishment grants have been drawn down while renters' rights remain far too weak. When will the Government act to ensure we have stronger renters' rights in law and when will it announce those revised upwards housing targets so we can see the necessary scale of ambition to deliver the homes we need?"	spk_9

This represents a significant step forward towards achieving justice for the people of Gaza. As we know, the court has now affirmed the gravity of the accusations against Israel and has called for preservation of human life for allowing humanitarian aid to pass and effectively for an end to the bombardment. All these measures are needed to stop war crimes and genocide in Gaza. Last week, the Dáil passed a motion which binds the Government as a matter of urgency to strongly consider an intervention in the South African case once preliminary orders have been made. While that wording was weaker than the working of the Sadaka draft of the cross-party motion that we in Labour had pushed for, nonetheless, now that preliminary orders have been made, will the Taoiseach set out exactly when the Government will make a decision on joining the case? I know there is to be a debate in the House tonight but it is a matter of huge urgency. We have seen more horrific deaths of civilians in Gaza over the weekend.	spk_45

I was particularly disappointed that the Government voted against the amendments from Labour and other Opposition parties to the Government motion. The amendments restated calls for a ceasefire and committed to intervening in the ICJ case in support of South Africa after provisional measures have been sought by that court. The Tánaiste will know that over the past week I have engaged in seeking support for a cross-party motion on Gaza and the ICJ proceedings. The motion in questions was drafted by Sadaka. Now that the votes have happened, what steps will be taken to fulfil the Government's obligation under the genocide convention to conduct an assessment of whether there is a serious risk of genocide in Gaza.

On behalf of the Labour Party, I am delighted to be bringing this Private Member's Bill to the Dáil for Second Stage debate today. Before I begin, I thank the advocacy groups, many of whom have joined us in the Gallery today, including LGBT Ireland, Equality for Children and Irish Gay Dads, as well as Labour LGBTQ+, who are sitting upstairs too. In particular, and it is always difficult to single out a few individuals, but I would like to thank Dr. Claire O’Connell, for her immense work in the drafting of this Bill, Pádraig Rice, Maeve Delargy, Ranae von Meding and Elaine Cohalan among the many who have been involved in the campaign to bring us to this point. I also thank in particular the families, including many babies, who have shared their stories, putting a face to these issues and bringing them into the spotlight. Many of these families and babies joined us on Tuesday in a very colourful photo opportunity outside of Leinster House, a cross-party opportunity which we organised to highlight the issue here. I also thank Chloe Manahan, my political adviser, who has done a great deal of work in bringing the Bill to this point. This Bill is an important milestone in Irish life, and I appreciate that the Minister is attending the Chamber to take the Bill. It will make fully real the Ireland that people voted for in the 2015 marriage equality referendum. The Labour Party has been a proud and very vocal ally of the LGBTQ+ community for decades. This Bill represents another page in the long chapter on the Labour Party’s role in fighting for LGBTQ+ people. My predecessor and then Tánaiste, Eamon Gilmore, aptly described marriage equality as the civil rights issue of our generation. I am proud of the role the Labour Party played in securing and winning that important referendum in 2015. While that campaign was won, as we all know, we have more work to do and there are still issues to address, not least legal issues. Passing this legislation would mark a further step towards realising the full equality that people in Ireland voted for in 2015. If passed, this Bill would finally allow for the children of all same-sex female couples, in particular, to have the right to a legal relationship with both of their parents. It is a matter of children's rights. I welcome again the families in the Gallery and note that they are particularly affected personally by current shortcomings in the law. I thank them and their representative organisations for their openness in bringing their stories to us, to the public and to me and my Labour Party colleagues, and to explain to us what this means for them. Not being recognised as a parent of your own child in law is a cause of deep hurt to many parents in our country. It says to them that they are invisible, that they are effectively a ghost parent and that they do not exist in the eyes of the law. There is hurt to the children, crucially, too in failing to secure a relationship in law with the parent. This Bill would address that hurt and recognise parents as they are. It would recognise that they have planned for these children together with their partners and that they are both parents and recognised as such in law.This is not just an issue of huge concern in terms of the hurt and distress it can cause. Not being recognised as a legal parent of your own child also has practical implications in terms of a child’s right to citizenship, inheritance and travel. The non-biological parent is able to apply for guardianship of their child, but only when the child turns two, and guardianship ends at the age of 18 and the child is then back to being a legal stranger. I think we all acknowledge that guardianship is not good enough. Parenting, by its nature, is filled with worries, as all of us who are parents will know. We worry about how children are doing at school, whether they will get sick and how they are getting on. Being a parent without recognition in law brings a whole other set of unnecessary worries about what would happen if the biological parent died or in all sorts of scenarios, in particular, what would happen to the children. These worries are very real. In our view, children in Ireland should not have to wait any longer to be treated equally. They deserve the same rights as their neighbours and classmates, regardless of how they were conceived or where they were born. Families in Ireland should not have to wait any longer to be treated equally. LGBT+ people, like so many groups which have been historically marginalised here in Ireland, have, unfortunately, become accustomed to having to fight for their rights. They fought for their very identity to be decriminalised in this State. They fought for laws to protect them from discrimination, and many Labour TDs and Oireachtas Members have fought with them and ensured the passage of enlightened legislation. In recent years, along with fighting for marriage equality, we fought to end employment discrimination against LGBT teachers, doctors and medical staff in schools and medical settings. We fought for gender recognition and we have now achieved legislation on that. We are still fighting for appropriate trans healthcare and for the right for families to receive equal legal protection. We want to ensure that people do not have to fight any longer. We want to ensure that our laws catch up with the reality of family diversity in Ireland and that the wishes of the Irish people from 2015 will be respected in ensuring we have equality for families. What does this Bill do? It proposes amendments to the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, itself groundbreaking legislation that regulates donor-assisted human reproduction. I am conscious that the Government has introduced the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022, which is currently on Committee Stage. That is welcome. The AHR Bill, as well as regulating surrogacy and other matters, itself proposes amendments to the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. These are amendments the advocacy groups that have been campaigning on these issues for many years are delighted to see. However, there are some ways in which the Bill does not go far enough. It does not close all of the gaps in the current legal framework, which is where our Bill comes in. The Bill seeks to address those gaps. The advocacy groups which have joined us in the Visitors Gallery today have provided legally robust means of filling the gaps. We and those groups want to work with the Minister to ensure the provisions in the Bill we propose will become law, whether in this Bill or through amendments to the Government’s legislation. The main gaps this Bill is designed to address are the following: first, for children conceived using known donors prior to 4 May 2020, which is the day the 2015 Act was fully commenced; second, for children born abroad; third, for children conceived abroad; fourth, for children conceived, whether in Ireland or abroad, through non-clinical insemination or at-home insemination; fifth, to ensure that children born to same-sex female couples can have access to citizenship through either of their parents; and, sixth, to introduce a provision on judicial discretion. The first point is to ensure that children conceived to known donors prior to the commencement of the 2015 Act will be covered. Currently, the 2015 Act creates a set of parameters for recognition and children who fall outside those parameters are not covered by law. We know that an amendment to the AHR Bill has been tabled which would address this issue. We want to ensure that that amendment is accepted and the legislation is enacted and commenced to ensure children in that scenario are covered. The second issue concerns children conceived abroad. Clearly, this can happen for a number of reasons. Our Bill proposes solutions whereby intending parents who have gone through screening, have confirmed the consent of those involved and have registered identifying information can be granted a declaration of parentage. Further, we want to ensure that children born abroad can be covered. We know there are many instances where children are born abroad to a couple who are living in Ireland and the children will then be brought up here in Ireland. Our concern is to ensure that those children will be brought within the scope of the 2015 legislation. It is of note that the Government’s AHR Bill amendments on Committee Stage will provide a pathway to parentage for some children in this scenario. What we want to achieve with this Bill is to ensure there is a pathway to parenthood for same-sex female couples, who will be able to apply for a declaration of parentage in our courts. The fourth issue is non-clinical insemination. We know that rates of infertility among same-sex female couples will be similar to the rest of the population. While there is no need for such couples to obtain the services of fertility clinics, which can be costly and medically invasive, we know that some couples may feel this is not sufficiently private and personal for conception. All families are different, so a variety of reasons may underpin a preference for non-clinical options, but that choice is really not there in practice. Reasons that have been given for the requirement to use a fertility clinic, which are reasons the Minister has given, are to ensure the child's right to identity and, of course, we fully appreciate that. We also know that the Minister wants to ensure that relevant medical information is provided. Again, this Bill proposes solutions that ensure the child's right to identity is vindicated and that relevant medical information is available, while also allowing parents to apply for a declaration of parentage. I have also referenced the issue of citizenship. We are concerned about cases where passports have been difficult to access for the children of same-sex female couples where the Irish mother was not the mother who had given birth. We believe that citizenship by descent should flow from the non-biological or non-birth parent as well as the biological parent and, again, amendments are proposed in this Bill to address that issue. The sixth issue relates to the lack of provision for judicial discretion. As somebody who formerly practised law myself, I know the courts are capable of and well used to applying discretion, particularly in family law cases, where it is often very important that there is some scope for discretion. Judicial discretion involves the application of the paramountcy principle so that in cases involving a question of parentage, the best interests of the child should be the paramount consideration. We would like to see this applied to cases of parentage related to donor-assisted human reproduction to ensure the best interests of the child are always the paramount consideration. Having spoken about the contents of the Bill, I want to turn to the procedural point. I welcome the fact the Minister is not opposing the Bill and I recognise that, but I want to express my disappointment that the Government has decided to table a nine-month delaying amendment. I know that nine months is preferable to the 12 months that we have seen for other Bills, and just last night, Government TDs voted to delay by an entire 12 months the Labour Bill that we introduced last week on reproductive healthcare leave, another important Bill which would provide for leave for the first time for women who experience early pregnancy loss before 24 weeks or those who need to access reproductive treatment and need time off work. That Bill has been delayed by a year and we are conscious that tactic will effectively mean the Bill will not proceed any further because we know the Dáil term will have to end within a year. The nine-month delay is somewhat preferable and I would be very glad to have the facility to work with the Minister and the advocacy groups to see that the provisions and principles that we have put forward in this Bill could be brought into law through a different mechanism, if necessary through amendments to the Government’s own AHR Bill, and it does not have to be through our particular Bill. However, we do want to see these measures brought into law before the end of the term of this Dáil. It is somewhat ironic, given the topic of the Bill, that the nine-month period has been used by the Government. We are going to oppose that delaying tactic but assuming that the nine-month delay is passed, we hope to work with the Minister and his officials to see how best we can address the gaps in the current legislative framework to provide for parentage of children. It is always frustrating for Opposition parties to see these delaying tactics in place, but it is particularly frustrating at this stage in the lifetime of the Dáil. As I said, we know that an election will have to be held by the first week of March 2025, so just over a year remains.The likelihood is that in nine months, which would bring us to the end of October, we will have had a general election. I know nobody is saying that but I think we are all conscious that it is a likely date. Therefore it is more than likely that in nine months, this Bill will have fallen. That is the frustration that all of us who have campaigned on it are experiencing now. It will effectively put a stay on the entire process unless the Minister can give us a commitment, and I hope he can, that he will work with us and with campaigners to see how best we can progress measures that are needed to ensure equality for families and for children. As I have said, we will more than happily engage with the Minister. We are very happy to work with him. We are not wedded to this particular Bill but we want to make sure the gaps we and campaigners have identified are addressed. We have an opportunity with this Bill, or with collaboration on its provisions, to instigate a shift which will be transformational for families. While the numbers may not be huge, for some families this will be really crucial. For some of the families with young babies and children that I have met, it will be an absolutely transformational change. The Minister campaigned for marriage equality, as I did, and as we did across the House. Realising the full intention of that historic vote in 2015 must involve collaborative work to make equal all families – and, importantly, all children – in the State. In a child’s eyes there is no difference between their biological and non-biological parent. There should be no difference in the eyes of the law. This Bill provides a mechanism to ensure that equality."	spk_400

I also thank colleagues who expressed support for the Bill. First, I will address the points made by the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, around the delaying mechanism in the amendment, which, as I have said, we cannot accept. We acknowledge the Government is not opposing the Bill and that is welcome but we are concerned that a nine-month delay mechanism will ultimately lead to the Bill falling with the end of the Dáil term. While we are not wedded to seeing the changes made through this Bill, we are anxious to ensure the changes are made. I listened very carefully to both the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, speaking about the proposed amendments to be made to the assisted human reproduction Bill and I note there are some changes in our Bill which the Minister said he cannot commit to introducing in his Bill. Therefore, our concern is that even with the AHR Bill making progress and further amendments being brought forward, gaps may still be left and we are anxious about that. We are very glad to collaborate and will engage with the Minister and his officials even after this debate to try to ensure we can get some progress made on amendments to the Government's AHR Bill that is very welcome. However, I take issue with the Minister's point about having two live Bills. We often have a Private Members' Bill moving in tandem with a Government Bill. Indeed, a Private Members' Bill from the Opposition often serves to put pressure on Government to move more swiftly with the progress of its own Bill. Nobody could say progress on the AHR Bill has been swift to date. Ten years ago, I was on the justice committee when we were looking at legislating for assisted human reproduction and for regulation of surrogacy. The committee held hearings and legislation was brought forward that ultimately culminated in what became the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. However, that is ten years ago and we have still only just started Committee Stage of the AHR Bill. We had put this Bill - drafted as I said with LGBT Ireland and Equality for Children - in the lottery at some point last year in the knowledge that the Government's Bill was making such slow progress at that stage. We did not know, of course, that we were going to be picked the very week that Committee Stage of the AHR Bill would commence. The coincidental timing is interesting. Certainly, it is not that we actively wanted to have two live Bills; it is more that we could see that no progress would be made unless we pushed the Government on it, so we brought this Bill forward and were delighted it was chosen to come up in the Private Members' Bill lottery tonight. We believe it would be possible to keep it alive, to move in tandem and in parallel with the other Bill, because this is only Second Stage of this Bill and it would have been perfectly possible to work with the Minister and Government on amending the Government's AHR Bill while having this Bill pass Second Stage and effectively sit there. I have done that before with other Bills and have worked with Government to ensure its provisions would be brought into law. Therefore, I do take issue with the Minister's comments about having two live Bills at the same time; it would have been perfectly possible. Indeed, it would have also been possible for the Minister to propose a shorter delay mechanism of three or six months. In reality, we might then have seen the provisions brought into law. However, I take heart from the text of the Government countermotion to the extent that it looks ""to allow sufficient time for commencement of the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022"", therefore indicating that it is hopeful we will pass the AHR Bill in its entirety and within nine months. That is certainly a positive step.  There is a very simple issue at the heart of this Private Members' Bill and Deputy Duncan Smith outlined it very eloquently when he said there really was a simple issue here: do children have the right to have their relationship with both parents recognised in law or not? Certainly, the enactment of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 marked a significant step forward to that end, to enable children of LGBT+ parents to have two same-sex parents listed on a child's birth certificate. For many families, that meant legal recognition for the first time but of course the parameters set by the legislation were and remain rather restrictive and that is at the heart of this Bill we have brought forward. We know from research others have cited, such as Dr. Lydia Bracken's research from the University of Limerick, that the majority of children born into same-sex families are conceived or born outside of those narrow parameters set by the 2015 Act and as a result are prevented from having a legal relationship with both of their parents. It is shocking in 2024 that more than half of children born into same-sex couple families are still prevented from having that relationship. It is an injustice and, as Deputy Smith said, it is as injustice most people do not realise is still in place. Most people in Ireland believe that the 2015 referendum resulted in equality for all families, included those headed by same-sex couples, and it is a surprise to many that there still gaps in the law. TDs across the House will have received dozens of testimonies from affected families explaining the real consequences of these gaps and the challenges for these families in their lived experience which arise due to the gaps in the 2015 framework. One such testimony, I found really moving. A woman emailed me to say: My wife and I are both Irish passport holders. Last year, we applied to have our toddler entered in the foreign births register but, just before Christmas, we were informed that he was refused because the application was made by me. Because I am not the birth mother, I am not recognised as my son's parent and may not claim Irish citizenship by descent for him. You will appreciate how this made us feel, coming especially at Christmas, when thoughts of family are paramount. We were shocked that this is the case for same sex couples in Ireland... All we ask is that our children are treated equally.That testimony, along so many others, really highlights the issues at the heart of this Bill we have brought forward. The stress, the upset, the complications - practical, emotional and other - that this causes have been confirmed, not just in the testimonies we have heard, but also in academic research. I am looking at the former Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Professor Conor O'Mahony's very important report from 2020 where he reviewed children's rights and best interests in the context of donor-assisted human reproduction and surrogacy. He said then that the current framework has had a negative impact on children's rights to non-discrimination and to recognition of family relationships. We acknowledge this is a complex area to regulate. As I said, it has been ten years since the justice committee first started looking at how best to achieve an effective and robust framework for regulation of AHR and of surrogacy. We have grappled with these issues in the context of other legislation too. When I was listening to the Minister's comments about a child's right to identity, I was struck by the parallels with the adoption information legislation that we have recently passed where we sought to find a way to ensure an adult's right to identity could be respected with access to information. There were huge difficulties in achieving that but we managed it. What we can do here is manage a way forward to ensure a child's right to identity is respected in law while also ensuring that same child's right to legal recognition of the relationship with both their parents is recognised in law. The Minister spoke about the need to be creative, to look at constructive ways to address the real issues that arise for families, and we want to help with that effort. We want to ensure we can work constructively. We hope to do so.  We will oppose the nine-month delay mechanism.If that nine-month delay mechanism is passed, let us use that time to ensure we can create the best possible legal framework through amendments to the Government's legislation, ensuring that the rights of the children we are speaking about tonight are respected in law. The changes we are proposing may seem technical but as we know, they hold real power to make a huge and transformational change for many families in our State. They are families to whom we owe it to bring forward necessary legal measures to respect and recognise their relationships in law - the relationships of children with parents and of parents with children. I again want to acknowledge that the Government is not opposing the Bill, and we all want to work to that same aim. I again thank those Deputies who spoke in support, and finally, I thank the individuals and advocacy groups who are represented in the Chamber to watch this debate tonight. I want to work with the Minister of State, with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly and with Government and Opposition colleagues to ensure we can achieve the necessary changes to respect the rights of those children and families for whom this would mean so much."	spk_415
Ivana Bacik	56	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2024-01-24	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	Everyone, regardless of where in Ireland they live or how much is in their pocket, deserves to be treated with dignity and respect when they are sick. Everyone deserves to have timely access to the medical treatments they need. I know the Taoiseach appreciates that, but his Government’s policies are hurting people in hospitals, not helping them. I am talking about the current HSE recruitment freeze, overcrowding, long waiting lists, the trolley crisis, a retention crisis and a lack of community supports for those discharged from hospital. The list goes on. Every week, we all hear healthcare horror stories. We hear from patients detailing awful experiences in hospital emergency departments; working people worrying about healthcare access for older parents or younger children; people with complex medical needs who are afraid of getting sick if they go into hospital; and front-line medical workers who are exhausted and worn out, looking to greener pastures in Australia, New Zealand or elsewhere. Yesterday, my Labour Party colleague in Limerick, Councillor Conor Sheehan, shared the recent awful experience of his grandfather, Gerry Mullins, at University Hospital Limerick. Last Thursday, on the advice of Mr. Mullins's GP, his family brought him to UHL emergency department to seek treatment for an ulcer in his leg. What followed his arrival offers a desperate insight into the reality of emergency healthcare in Ireland. Upon discovering that his ulcer had become septic, the overworked staff at UHL began to treat Councillor Sheehan's grandfather, who at that point had become extremely unwell. However, over the course of the emergency treatment while very unwell, he had to spend four days on a trolley. During that time, Conor Sheehan and his family witnessed frenetic scenes at UHL, with multiple vulnerable patients exhausted, agitated and having to wait on trolleys. The nursing and medical staff are chronically overworked and overburdened. The staff at UHL deserve so much more than to have to work under those conditions. Patients at UHL and their families deserve better, too. We know this is not an isolated case. I express my sympathies again to the family of 16-year-old Aoife Johnston, who died so tragically from meningitis at UHL in December 2022. Conditions in our hospitals have major ramifications for health outcomes. The INMO tells us it takes just six hours on a trolley for a person’s long-term health outcomes to decline. There is no more give in the system. It falls to the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and their colleagues to address the crisis, with the INMO telling us that 1,552 people have been on trolleys in UHL alone since the beginning of January. Across the country, so many medical professionals are working through yet another winter in impossible and often dangerous environments. All that is achieved by miserly recruitment freezes is to put more pressure on services. Will the Taoiseach end the damaging recruitment freeze, address the trolley crisis and ensure our hospitals are safe? What will he do this winter to address the healthcare needs of the people of Limerick in the context of the ongoing crisis at UHL?	spk_53
Ivana Bacik	56	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2024-01-24	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	I thank the Taoiseach for his words for Conor Sheehan. I absolutely agree with him regarding the immense hard work and commitment of medical staff throughout the country but he has given me a standard response on the recruitment freeze. The reality is that lifting the freeze for certain contracts and grades will fix nothing. It will not entice healthcare professionals back from Australia, Dubai or Britain. It is an indictment of the Government's healthcare policies that even now, even with the improvements listed by the Taoiseach, Conor Sheehan's family's story is not unique; it is replicated across the country. It is an indictment that we have come to accept that long waiting lists in hospitals are somehow normal. People go to hospital to get better. Hospitals should not be a place where conditions will worsen while people languish awaiting a bed. Our healthcare staff should be treated with respect and we should see the full recruitment freeze lifted across all grades, as our healthcare staff are seeking. We need to fix things. The Taoiseach has not addressed the issue relating to UHL. That is a particular stain on the healthcare system. I again ask the Taoiseach what he will do for the people of Limerick this winter.	spk_55

There is a regeneration project, but people living in Oliver Bond will be waiting ten to 15 years before that will be resolved. One resident said five of them are living in a two-bed flat full of mould. It is very serious. I know the issue was raised yesterday. The Taoiseach told the House then that this is primarily a matter for Dublin City Council, and cited other areas where regeneration has been desperately slow, but he did say that the issue of Oliver Bond has came up at the housing subcommittee and that he will raise the conditions there with Dublin City Council's new CEO. Can the Taoiseach commit to ensuring that the regeneration of Oliver Bond will proceed more swiftly, and that sufficient funding will be provided to empower local authorities to regenerate existing social housing stock in other complexes across the country?	spk_87

We in the Labour Party brought forward a Private Member's Bill last Thursday to deal with that, to address that issue and to provide for reproductive health leave.We were very disappointed that the Government sought to put in a year-long stay on debate on that Bill. We will vote tomorrow night on that 12-month delaying amendment and because the House will likely not be sitting in a year's time, a year's delay amounts to ending any prospect of the Bill becoming law this year. One of the reasons the Government put forward for delaying the Bill was that it needed to publish research commissioned by the Department of equality and completed by the UCC pregnancy loss research group last October. Today, the Minister, Deputy O’Gorman, confirmed to me that the report would be published this week.

Ivana Bacik	56	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2024-01-23	dail	33	Conflict in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory: Motion	dbsect_9	-----given the seriousness of the issues we are debating and discussing. We have all been watching, over the past 100 days, with increasing distress and horror the carnage in Gaza and the utter devastation of a civilian population as a result of the brutal Israeli bombardment. Since the attack by Hamas on 7 October, which was itself brutal and resulted in appalling death and the taking of hostages, we have seen a death toll in Gaza that has surpassed 25,000 people. That is approximately 1% of the entire population. Tens of thousands of homes have been bombarded into rubble. An entire population has been kettled into overcrowded and cramped spaces, deprived of humanitarian aid and with famine and disease now ravaging communities of displaced Gazans. We have heard the heartbreaking testimony from journalists and doctors.We have seen so many children orphaned, killed, or hideously injured and the situation is getting worse and worse. It is apocalyptic. It is hard to see it or describe it as anything but genocidal. We are seeing, of course, as the Tánaiste noted in his speech, that the West Bank is increasingly tense and the situation is worsening there too. The Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Netanyahu, has made his intentions clear. He has ruled out any possibility of a peaceful, two-state solution and has stamped out any hope that might remain for relief and an end to the carnage. We are left with having to ensure the international community will intervene to ensure we do see that peaceful, two-state solution of which the Tánaiste has spoken and for which the international community should now be pressing. The Tánaiste spoke, hopefully, of an Arab peace but we need to push for that. We need to see a united front across the international community in condemnation of Netanyahu's government and of the Israeli carnage that is being inflicted on the people of Gaza. That wish for a common purpose, for solidarity from the international community, is replicated in the communications we have all received from people across the country who want to see that unity of purpose advocated by the Irish Government. They want to see our Government calling for a stronger response from the EU, America, Britain and other western countries to bring about a permanent ceasefire and an end to the brutal bombardment and suffering of the people of Gaza. That is why the South African application to the International Court of Justice matters so much. International law exists to preserve the life and dignity of all humans. It recognises the inherent value of every life. Our international human rights system was born out of the horrors of the Second World War and out of a collective will to reject evil and brutality and to ensure we would have a rules-based international order that could stop the sort of carnage we are seeing now. While that carnage continues, international law is being set at naught and South Africa has recognised that in bringing this case under the Genocide Convention. The capacity of the international community to speak with one voice for an end to genocide and for peace may seem a low bar but it is one we must overcome. Ireland has shown leadership before and we have sought to work constructively with the Government to see that sort of constructive leadership. We saw it in the early stages of progress on the Control of Economic Activities (Occupied Territories) Bill and in 2021 when this House voted unanimously to condemn the de facto annexation of Palestine by Israel, the first parliament in the EU to do so. We nearly achieved that sort of commonality of purpose in October when most of us supported a cross-party motion calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. It is for that reason that we in the Labour Party are disappointed to see the style of politics that has prevailed this week. Last week I circulated to all party leaders in this House, and to Seanad leaders, a motion which we hoped could form the basis of negotiations to develop a cross-party, united approach in support of the current proceedings in the International Court of Justice. That motion was drafted by the Sadaka organisation with support from Christian Aid. I thank those party leaders who did engage and show support for that motion, many of whom wanted to see it brought forward in Government or Opposition time because it really matters for this House to speak with one, united voice. It is unfortunate we could not achieve a consensus on the wording of that motion. It is also unfortunate to see, in some quarters of this House, attempts to take ownership by individual groups and to see the Government motion circulated so late in the day. I thank the Tánaiste for his personal engagement with me and others but it was very late in the day when we finally saw the text of the motion, with a deadline for amendments less than an hour later. That is no way to do business. It is anathema to what we should be doing, which is working together to try to build a consensus in support of the people of Gaza and to try to achieve an end to their suffering. The motion before us today does not make an unequivocal commitment to intervening and that is regrettable. That is why the Labour Party has tabled an amendment, which I think I can move now. However, I do welcome the clear statement of intent to intervene which is indicated in the text of the Government motion. As others have acknowledged, that does represent a movement by Government, and one which is very welcome. That is the spirit in which it has been drafted and Sadaka and other groups recognise that, but what is of concern is that, within the Government motion, not only is there the omission of any reference to a ceasefire explicitly, there is also an omission of any intention to conduct an assessment of whether there is a serious risk of genocide or to use the measures available to Government to deter the commission of genocide, as per the duty to prevent genocide set out in the Genocide Convention, an obligation which the Irish Government has stated exists in its intervention in the Ukraine 	spk_221

She approached me because many members of the INTO had approached her and other officials to express concern about having to take time off work to undergo treatments for reproductive health-related issues, such as This became a big issue for the INTO. In response, the union carried out a survey in 2019 and found that 60% of respondents, mostly women, as would be the case with the INTO membership, had faced reproductive health difficulties in their workplaces. Clearly, then, this was an issue for their members. A motion was passed at the union's annual conference seeking a change in the law to enable recognition of early pregnancy loss and reproductive health. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Richmond, to the Chamber. I was explaining the background to the legislation we in the Labour Party are bringing forward today. As I said, it stems from work done by the INTO and Councillor Alison Gilliland. I pay tribute to the INTO and to Alison for their pioneering work on this matter and for pushing this legislation. After passing the motion at its annual conference, the union approached me and my Labour Party colleagues to seek assistance in introducing a measure into law that would enable recognition for the first time of early pregnancy loss and of IVF treatment and reproductive health issues. We worked on the Bill for some time and, in March 2021, I published this legislation as a Senator, along with other Labour Party Senators, to provide statutory leave to those suffering so-called early miscarriage, pregnancy loss early in term or needing time off for reproductive healthcare treatment.The structure we used was to amend the existing Organisation of Working Time Act and to use that statutory framework to introduce this entitlement to a new, albeit relatively short, period of leave. I am conscious that we could have gone down a different route and used the employment equality legislation or the maternity protection legislation but we believed at the time that this was the appropriate framework because it already includes provision for  We drafted this legislation following that input from the INTO. At the time, we knew that many teachers were suffering and enduring early miscarriage or pregnancy loss and finding their workplaces really not receptive or warm places in which to recover from their ordeal. However, nothing prepared us for the outpouring of correspondence we have received since we introduced the Bill from women across the country who suffered loss of pregnancy early in term, couples who have been balancing work commitments with IVF treatments and men watching their partners struggle with fertility issues. It has been incredibly moving. I have received highly personal and poignant messages from women struggling to conceive and having to undergo successive cycles of IVF without success and from women who have experienced miscarriage early in term and not so early in term. Miscarriage up to 24 weeks is simply not recognised in our workplaces and there is no entitlement to leave. Women have had to take sick leave or unpaid leave in order to recover from their experience.  What has been really moving is that some of the women and men who have disclosed the trauma of pregnancy loss to me had never shared it with others. The publication of this Bill and the debates on it in the Seanad that followed have uncovered a groundswell of feeling out there. We have talked about an unspoken tsunami of grief and the sort of loss that so many have experienced. It is, in fact, a very widespread issue but it is an unspoken one. We believe that publishing and bringing forward this Bill is also a way of highlighting this issue and this trauma and enabling more people to speak up and gain support from the experiences of others. It is what we call the need for leave when it matters most or the need for compassion in our law. As with the campaign to repeal the eighth amendment, there is a groundswell of support for this and a sizeable group of people who feel that they were unable to speak up until now. This silence may have been due to stigma or just because it was so difficult to speak about their experience. As we know, reproductive healthcare has for far too long been marginalised as an issue in this country. That is why it is so important for us to push this Bill within the Oireachtas and to shift our workplaces to be a little bit kinder and more compassionate. As I have said, we are conscious that a great many women have experienced this. It is estimated that 14,000 women experience pregnancy loss each year. Our maternity protection law currently only offers leave to those who endure this experience after 24 weeks. We need some recognition for earlier pregnancy loss. This Bill passed through all stages in the Seanad and finished in that House last November. It had Government support there. We had hoped that we would today see Government accepting the Bill, at least on Second Stage, in the Dáil and then working with us to bring it into law in whatever format it wished. We are very disappointed to see the Government seeking to delay the Bill by 12 months when we know that an election is likely to have taken place in that time. One will certainly have had to have taken place within 14 months and yet the Second Reading of the Bill is to be delayed for 12 months. There is therefore no reality to the Bill becoming law during the term of this Government if the Government's amendment is accepted. That is deeply disappointing, not so much for us in Labour, but for all of those who are clearly and desperately affected. I urge the Minister not to move the amendment to delay the Bill.  We have seen the rationale offered by Government. It talks about the study it has commissioned. I will take the opportunity to thank those engaged in carrying out that study. I refer to the UCC pregnancy loss research group. It has conducted an incredible study into pregnancy loss in the workplace and it has been really valuable to see that work being done. Professor Keelin O'Donoghue, who has been leading the research, is in the Gallery for this debate. The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, commissioned the research. He informed us of this research project in November 2022. He informed us of the plans in the equality committee following a Labour Party amendment to a Government Bill, which would have given effect to our Bill, being ruled out of order. We were concerned that the commissioning of the report might delay matters further but we now understand that the research has been completed.  I again thank Professor O’Donoghue, Professor Mary Donnelly, Dr. Marita Hennessy and Ruadh Kelly Harrington. They are to be commended on their extensive and detailed work, which I understand to shine a comprehensive light on the effect in the workplace of the experience of pregnancy loss and fertility issues. As I have said, these are issues that are very often shrouded in secrecy. In December, the research group presented preliminary findings to TDs and to the Labour Party and offered useful suggestions. Its survey of more than 900 individuals appears to confirm that 95% of those surveyed would seek to avail of specific leave if such a provision was in place rather than having to take sick leave or unpaid leave, as I have mentioned.  The work the group has done should serve as an impetus for Government to act and to work with us, the Minister for equality and other Ministers, if necessary, to find a way to make this legislation work. It is simply not good enough to see it being delayed further. My Labour colleagues in the Seanad, Senators Marie Sherlock, Rebecca Moynihan, Annie Hoey and Mark Wall, really pushed this legislation through in November and were really glad to get strong support from Government Senators as the Bill went through the different stages in the Seanad. It is therefore very disappointing to see a different approach now being taken in the Dáil and to see Government making use of this delaying tactic to delay further debate on the Bill for 12 months. I again appeal to the Minister of State to withdraw the amendment, to enable the Bill to pass Second Stage and to work with us - we are very happy to work with him - to see what amendments are necessary to ensure this Bill can become law. We would love to see it become law this calendar year, before the end of the Minister of State's Government's term. I will point out that other countries have introduced this measure in different ways. New Zealand, the Philippines, India, Indonesia, Taiwan and others all have some form of reproductive health leave. It is not unprecedented. We have seen the Government introduce domestic violence leave, which is very welcome. Indeed, this made use of a similar structure, being introduced through the Organisation of Working Time Act. It is beyond time for the Government to move on this Bill. I appeal to the Minister of State to enable it to pass Second Stage today. It will have overwhelming support in this House and from the many women and couples for whom it really matters.	spk_331

I will pick up where Deputy Ó Ríordáin finished; this is a matter of gender equality. I thank colleagues across the Opposition who have supported this Bill and who have seen it as a measure to introduce better provision for women in the workplace in particular. I said earlier that about 14,000 women in Ireland experience pregnancy loss each year. This does not just affect women; it affects their partners and it affects couples. We know that between one in four and one in six couples experience fertility issues and that more than one in five pregnancies end in miscarriage. This is a huge issue that affects a huge number of people but it is also a women's rights and a workplace rights issue. This Bill was first debated in the Seanad in 2021 and three years have passed since then. Now the Minister of State is proposing another year's delay before we even come to a further debate on the Bill. How many more women will experience miscarriage in that time? How many more couples will be looking for IVF and going to multiple appointments without any provision in the workplace for leave? I have listened to the Minister of State's remarks and to the remarks of the Minister of State, Deputy Richmond, and we in the Labour Party accept that the legislation can be improved on. There have been changes to workplace law since we first introduced this Bill. There are new statutory frameworks around leave and we are prepared to work with the Minister of State to use other means than the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 framework through which we can introduce this provision. The important thing is the provision for compassionate leave, not how we do it or the vehicle. We can move to do it through maternity protection legislation; I take the Minister of State's point on that and that would remove the onus from the employer. We can do it through those other structures. I have prided myself on collaboration with Government and Opposition colleagues throughout my career in the Oireachtas, as have my Labour Party colleagues, whether it has been on Coco's law; collective bargaining rights; children's citizenship rights; ending discrimination against LGBTQ teachers; or prohibiting female genital mutilation. My Labour Party colleagues and I have worked with others to bring our Private Members' Bills into law. We are keen to continue doing this and to use this Bill to work with the Government to ensure we have compassionate leave when it matters most. It matters most for those many women and couples who have contacted us. We know the Government has conducted research. We know that research is concluded. I referred earlier to Professor Keelin O'Donoghue and the study on pregnancy loss under 24 weeks but we have not heard from the Government on when it proposes to publish that research. We know it is concluded and we have heard preliminary findings. The Minister of State has referred to the recommendations in the report. I have submitted parliamentary questions to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, seeking a response on when the study will be published. The Minister of State's briefing, which we were provided with this evening, says it will be published shortly but neither the Minister of State nor the Minister of State, Deputy Richmond, said in their speeches when that would be. I ask the Minister of State to follow up with us on this point before the vote on the amendment the Minister of State is proposing, which will take place next week. The Government cannot get away with introducing an amendment to delay further consideration of this Bill. It cannot use that fantastic research study as its excuse for a delaying amendment and then not even commit to publishing that research or letting us know what the recommendations in it are. I would like to join my Labour Party colleagues in making a last plea to the Government to reconsider its position. We will not see a vote on the Government's delaying amendment until next week so let us use that time to work with the Minister of State and other Government Departments that are affected to produce a plan to introduce paid leave for early pregnancy loss, reproductive healthcare and compassion in the workplace. Our political system can change lives radically for the better, or it can look the other way.Kicking this Bill down the road as the Government is trying to do amounts to looking the other way and not hearing from the women and the couples who are living the reality of pregnancy loss and fertility issues. I will finish by recounting something that was said to me by a woman who experienced or suffered or endured what we call an early miscarriage. She said that language of early miscarriage does not reflect her feeling or the feeling of her partner in losing what was a much-wanted pregnancy. As she said to me, often that so-called early miscarriage has followed many years of pregnancy losses and multiple rounds of IVF treatment, of endlessly trying and failing to conceive a baby. Depriving women and couples in her position of any time off or any official recognition in the workplace because the pregnancy was lost before 24 weeks or because of foetal weight issues lacks compassion. Our Bill would provide compassionate leave for women and couples in that position when it matters most. It would create a modern understanding of this experience in the workplace. Women like the woman who spoke with me can of course apply for sick leave in such a situation, but they are not sick. They can take annual leave, but that is not what annual leave is for. I am appealing to Minister of State to let us enable proper, formal recognition in the workplace of this form of loss, namely, of pregnancy loss and fertility treatment issues, and let us legislate rather than delay for a further 12 months. It is unnecessary and it is not compassionate.	spk_343

I have raised the condition of facilities and infrastructure at the Enable Ireland Sandymount School. I put on record that while I welcome the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, I am disappointed the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte is not here to take this issue and I know that was a matter of the Ceann Comhairle’s making. I have engaged with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on this and she has a very particular interest in the conditions here and is concerned about gaps in the provision of disability services and therapies in the Sandymount school, as am I. I commend the amazing work that has been done at the Enable Ireland Sandymount School, especially the work of the principal, Jennifer Doyle, and her staff. This school is located on Sandymount Avenue in the heart of my constituency of Dublin Bay South. All those who live in the locale will be very well aware of it, as will many others who live further away, because it does a huge amount of work in providing education but also therapeutic support, treatments and interventions for children, many of whom have significant challenges and special needs and who require significant supports. I had the pleasure of visiting the school most recently for its Christmas fair on 8 December, at the invitation of the principal, so I could see the facilities for myself and meet many of the pupils, parents and of course the staff who provide the supports. I wanted to hear from them directly about the work they are doing and the sort of issues they face. As I have said, many of the children require significant supports and have very particular needs. There is also an especially poignant issue in that some of the children have life-shortening conditions and there have been some very sad losses. I express my sincere condolences and sympathies to the families and the communities of those children who have so sadly died so young, in some cases, and who were pupils of the school. On a happier note, in December I had the pleasure of viewing for myself the new playground facility that has been constructed at the school and of which the school and indeed the pupils are extremely appreciative. We viewed the playground and saw the hugely transformative impact it is having for children attending the school and for whom it provides a really important way of having play amenities available to them. However, while the playground is new and very impressive, the condition of the building is unfortunately far from impressive. The building is in an appalling condition. There are holes in the ceilings and walls. There are leaking ceilings and I saw the buckets the school staff are placing because rain is coming through. Conditions are deteriorating at a very rapid pace. I also saw how some of the most critical and normally most heavily used rooms, such as soft play areas for example, are simply out of use. The children have no access to these rooms and that is really impacting upon the quality of not just their education, but their treatment and any therapeutic intervention the school is offering to them. We cannot stand over this in Ireland in 2024. I am asking that the Government intervene to provide improvements in the conditions so the school has the necessary supports to fix the leaks and the buildings and ensure the children can have fit-for-purpose conditions in their school.	spk_347

The Minister and her Government are presiding over an abject failure on housing. This failure is devastating, particularly for those 13,514 people, including 4,000 children, who are in homelessness. That is a record figure and a shameful record. The housing crisis is also impacting on the hundreds of thousands of young adults living out of childhood bedrooms and the many thousands who are emigrating to Australia and other countries every year to find homes of their own. It is affecting thousands of people, including those I meet in my constituency every week, who are stuck in a rental poverty trap and cannot see themselves ever owning a home of their own. The Government's housing failure is also affecting other policies and other services the State should and could be providing. We have a chronic shortage of teachers in our schools. We all know this. We have a chronic shortage of carers and educators in our childcare settings and there is a real difficulty recruiting medical staff for our hospitals. The reason in large part is that so many people cannot afford to live anywhere near their workplace or within a reasonable distance of it. The abject failure in housing is also affecting other things. It is affecting our response to the humanitarian challenge we are facing because of the brutal war in Ukraine and the many wars and conflicts around the world which are forcing so many people to flee to our shores seeking refuge. We have always been a land of welcomes, from which so many of our own so-called unvetted males and females had to flee to find a better life in England, Australia, America and elsewhere. We know the Irish diaspora now exceeds our own population on this island by a factor of ten. Now that those seeking refuge from war or persecution are coming to our shores, we must offer a real welcome to them, just as we offer a welcome to those who come here to work and share their experience and expertise, the people who drive our buses, work in our hospitals and make our society better.The reality is that across Ireland in the past two years, since that invasion of Ukraine began, our communities have offered a welcome to the many thousands of people who have fled here. Only in a small number of cases have we seen protests or opposition to new arrivals. I want to condemn outright the small number of very serious criminal actions we have seen committed, even in recent weeks in terms of arson, but also violence, intimidation, assault and threats. It is disappointing to see even Government party elected officials undermining the welcome effort. I am thinking of Mayo County Council's vote last night, for example. The reality is that there is no refugee crisis. It is wrong to categorise it in that way. We do have a housing crisis and that is adding to the challenge of finding accommodation for our new arrivals. The Minister said it herself in response to the earlier question. The answer is that we do need to build more homes. The Minister said that. We need to increase the supply of our housing stock. We are hearing it from families living in hotel rooms, renters facing eviction and parents desperate to see their young people stay here and not move to Melbourne or Perth. Why will the Government not take on the necessary ambition and urgency to deliver the homes the Minister acknowledges are so badly needed? Why will it not adopt the credible targets for delivery for housing we just heard the construction industry stakeholders calling for in the past week? We heard the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, calling for it. Why will the Government not adopt credible targets for the delivery of housing?	spk_24

The Minister's answer acknowledges that.Construction industry stakeholders themselves point out that without credible targets, we simply will never meet the delivery we need to do for our growing population. We have heard it from across industry, with the Construction Industry Federation confirming over the weekend that there is capacity and a need for up to 60,000 new builds per year. As I have been hearing from the Taoiseach for months that the Housing for All targets are too low and that they will be revised and updated, I am asking precisely when will we see the new revised targets and whether they will meet that clear level of need of need. This time last year, we in Labour called for 50,000 new builds per year. We also pointed out that we will need to see 50,000 deep retrofit and refurbishments a year to address that vacancy and dereliction crisis that the Minister mentions. Those figures have been borne out by reports from the ESRI, by calls from Sherry Fitzgerald and Dr. Ronan Lyons. How many times does the Government need to be told its targets are not credible currently and will never meet the existing level of need until we adopt credible targets and see a housing plan from the Government that is sufficiently ambitious and urgent to deliver the homes our people so badly need?	spk_26

Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I am delighted we are at this point where we are debating Committee Stage of the Thirty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution (The Family) Bill 2023. We had a good debate on Second Stage in December. I think there was a general agreement that we do need to amend Article 41 and in particular to amend the provisions that restrict the definition of ""family"" to that based upon marriage. As I said in December, I think we all recognise the shameful legacy within this State of our treatment in the past as a society of families that did not conform to that constitutional model of a family based upon marriage. That current definition in Article 41 in no way reflects the current and wonderful diversity of family life in Ireland. We are, therefore, agreed on the need to amend the family definition just as we are agreed when we come to debate the Fortieth Amendment of the Constitution (Care) Bill 2023 that the language used in Article 42.2 referring to women and mothers is sexist, outdated and anachronistic. The question is about how we amend the provisions, which is why we have tabled amendments. We do this in order to be constructive. The Minister will be aware that I pointed out on Second Stage that the wording in both the thirty-ninth and fortieth amendments that is proposed by the Government differs significantly from that proposed by the joint Committee on Gender Equality, which I had the honour of chairing. On that cross-party Oireachtas committee on which a number of those in the House served, including Deputy Clarke, we devised a particular form of wording to reflect the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality chaired by Dr. Catherine Day. We were keen to ensure the wording we proposed would be adopted by Government. Indeed, we called on Government to adopt that wording and to bring forward referendums in respect of both family and care during the course of 2023. We were disappointed at the delay. In particular, we were very conscious of the impact the continued failure to amend Article 41 would have for families, like the family of Johnny O'Meara. I raised Johnny O'Meara's case with the Minister in December. This is the very tragic case of Mr. O'Meara, who is a father of three from Nenagh in County Tipperary and whose partner, Michelle Batey, sadly died from cancer following their relationship having subsisted for more than 20 years. Like so many other couples - 150,000 across Ireland - they were cohabiting and had not married. They had three children and it turned out that Johnny was not legally entitled to the support of the widower's pension upon Michelle's death because they had been cohabiting. Indeed, Johnny took his case to the High Court but lost his case there in October 2022. Mr. Justice Heslin said the case hinged on ""a legitimate decision made by the State to support, not families, but those who made the choice to enter the marriage contract."" The appeal was heard in the Supreme Court in October and judgment is awaited. Judgment is, in fact, due from the Supreme Court on that case on Monday. The reason I mentioned the case again is to note that judgment is imminently due, but also to note that the continued failure to amend the Constitution to reflect the true diversity of family life in Ireland has a real impact for those families who are excluded from protection currently. We are, therefore, agreed on the need for change. I asked two specific questions in my Second Stage speech. I want to refer to those questions because that is why we tabled this amendment. I am speaking particularly on amendment No. 2, of course, which is our substantive amendment on this Bill. Given that we recognise the need to extend the definition of family beyond that based on marriage, in the committee, we took the view that it could be done most effectively in two different ways, and we proffered two alternative versions of the amendment.Neither of our proposals would have amended Article 41.1 at all. My first question was why the Minister chose to amend Article 41.1 and why that was seen as necessary. I looked carefully back at the Minister's response on Second Stage and I still did not see why that amendment was necessary. Amendment No. 2 in the names of my Labour colleagues deletes the amendment the Government is proposing to Article 41.1. We believed it was possible to change and expand the definition of family simply by amending Article 41.3 of the Constitution and that this would be preferable - to leave Article 41.1 as is - because Article 41.1 ""recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society"". It does not restrict the definition of family in any way. It is Article 41.3, which has the clause stating, ""the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, ..."", and we proposed simply an amendment to Article 41.3. We proposed two alternative versions. My first question is, why has the Minister amended Article 41.1 and will he accept Labour's amendment, which would delete that amendment to Article 41.1? Our second question is, why, when amending Article 41.1, the Minister is doing so by inserting the phrase that he is proposing here, after ""the Family, "", whether founded on marriage or on other durable relationships"". On Second Stage, there was some discussion by quite a number of Deputies about this phrase, ""durable relationships"". I want to speak to that for a few moments and then turn to what we are proposing on Article 41.3 and why, in our Labour amendment, we have taken the second option that we proposed on the Joint Committee on Gender Equality - the more minimalist version but which continues to protect the institution of marriage. The phrase ""durable relationships"" was addressed, as I have said, on Second Stage, by a number of speakers. The Minister of State, Deputy Carroll MacNeill, made an interesting contribution on the phrase ""durable relationships"". The Deputy pointed out that the phrase was ""not a constitutional concept"" that she had seen. Indeed, I made the same point, that it was new to the Constitution. In Deputy Carroll MacNeill's Second Stage speech, she asks the question:What is durability? Is it about commitment or enduring? What is the difference between a durable relationship between adults and an enduring relationship? I could be in a durable intimate personal relationship with somebody that lasts for ten or 20 years, and I could have an enduring friendship with somebody that lasts for 40 or 50 years. These are different relationships. ... the way the concept is phrased ... links it to intimacy and permanence.The Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, later on Second Stage, spoke about ""durable and committed relationships"", although, in fact, the word ""committed"" is not used. We are asking, why insert this phrase ""durable relationship"" and, crucially, what does it mean? In his response on Second Stage, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, talked about this some more. The Minister referred to the use of the phrase in EU law. It has been referenced in just one case before the Supreme Court, that is, the 2020 case which related to the EU directive on citizenship and in which Ms Justice Marie Baker made some comments about what durable means in the context of the EU directive. The ""durable"" requirement does not amount to ""permanent"", Ms Justice Marie Baker said. It means the relationship must be one which has continued for some time and to which the parties are committed, etc. The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, pointed out that that is not the definition of durable that he is seeking to put into the Constitution. Indeed, the Minister said, ""The definition of 'durable' that we are seeking to put into the Irish Constitution is not influenced by the EU law definition of 'durable'."" The Minister stated further, ""The intention is to capture ... committed relationships that exist ... between couples and between a parent and children."", whereas in the EU citizenship directive, it is used specifically in connection only with interpersonal adult relationships between couples, not the relationship between a parent and children. We all appreciate - not only those in this House but those who are watching these debates and looking at the wording and who are planning campaigning in support of the referendum - and are grateful for that clarification that ""durable relationship"" clearly applies to a single-parent family, a relationship between a parent and a child, as well as to couples who are committed to each other in what we might colloquially understand as a durable relationship. Although somebody said a relationship is always durable until it is not, people intend a relationship to remain durable in the context of couples. There was significant concern on Second Stage about that phrase ""durable relationship"", and while, as I said, we appreciate the clarification that it is not meant in the same way as it is in the EU directive, and that directive and that definition, and Ms Justice Marie Baker's judgment should not have bearing on how we understand it in the Constitution, I suppose all of that reinforces my initial question. Why are we using it in the Constitution? If it is not drawn from the EU directive and if our understanding of it in the Constitution is to be different and to be more expansive, which is positive, why use it at all? Why not use the more minimalist amendment that we are proposing? That brings me to what is in our amendment No. 2. We propose to take out the change the Minister is proposing to Article 41.1, not to use the phrase ""durable relationships"" but rather to change Article 41.3.1° to take out the phrase ""on which the Family is founded"". The reason we propose this change is because we were mindful that, as the Minister said, the first constitutional change the committee had proposed, where we would have said, ""The State pledges itself to guard with special care the Family, including but not limited to the marital family."", would have removed the protection for marriage. The Minister pointed out that the Government does not want to remove the protection for marriage. I appreciate that. That is a fair point and indeed, the committee was mindful of that in the text of its report, at page 38 of which we said that an alternative means to achieve the citizens' assembly aim, that is, to expand the definition of family, would involve simply the deletion of the phrase ""on which the Family is founded"". That would retain the special protection for the institution of marriage but it would remove its qualification effect upon the definition of family. This alternative approach, the committee said, would enable recognition of a more expansive definition of family and would ensure retention of special recognition for the institution of marriage, and it would not introduce a new phrase ""marital family"", which is not currently in the text of the Constitution. For our Labour amendment, therefore, we have sought to achieve the aim of the citizens' assembly, the aim of the committee and the aim that most people in the House have expressed a desire for, which is to ensure a more expansive definition of family, but we have sought to do so in a way that will continue to protect the institution of marriage but that will not introduce any new phrase, such as ""durable relationship"", into the Constitution. I ask that the Minister would consider taking this amendment on board or, if not, that he might say why not. I appreciate the Minister's reasoning behind not taking on board the committee's proposal to insert Article 41.3.1° with reference to marital family but we had that alternative proposition, which we have now brought forward by way of amendment, which would retain protection of the institution of marriage but which, in our view, would be enough to ensure an expanded definition of family and to protect those who might find themselves in the awful situation faced by Mr. Johnny O'Meara and his children. We are appreciative of the immense work that has been done and the huge amount of preparatory work that has gone into this by the Minister, by his officials, by the committee, by the citizens' assembly chaired by Dr. Catherine Day and by all the civil society groups that have been working on this. I acknowledge that those groups are present in the Gallery. We have Ms Orla O'Connor and Ms Eilish Balfe from the National Women's Council and I know there are many more watching. One Family, Treoir and Family Carers Ireland have already launched campaigns in support of the referendum. I stress we are all very much supportive of the aims of the referendum. We want to see Article 41 amended, both in reference to family and in reference to care, and, of course, crucially, to see the sexist language around women and mothers deleted and replaced. We are all working to that same aim. We are simply putting questions that will be important questions in the course of the referendum campaign. I am assuming the amendments will not be passed. Assuming that the Government wording goes to the people, it will be useful for all of us campaigning on the referendum to have clarification based upon what is said today in the Dáil. We want to put these amendments forward, therefore, in that constructive frame and to ask in response that the Minister might clarify those two issues, namely, why depart from our view that only an amendment to Article 41.3 would be necessary and if he is putting a amendment in Article 41.1, why use this phrase ""durable relationships""? I might add a third point. Why not take the more straightforward approach of just amending Article 41.3? I am conscious that the Government is doing the Article 41.3 amendment as well and deleting the phrase ""on which the Family is founded"". We are supportive of that but why is there a need for Article 41.1 to also be amended?"	spk_203
Ivana Bacik	56	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2024-01-17	dail	33	Thirty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution (The Family) Bill 2023: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_11	"I thank the Minister for his response, which has been helpful. I agree that the text in the Thirty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution (The Family) Bill 2023 is a vast improvement on the current text in Article 41, in that it enables the recognition of family units beyond those based on marriage. We have all acknowledged that. Cohabitees and single-parent families will be recognised for the first time and that is hugely welcome. The Minister referred to the recommendations in the citizens' assembly report and the gender equality committee's report as being more expansive that just the constitutional changes recommended.As others have said, we published a full report on the 45 recommendations of the citizens' assembly which was, in our view, a blueprint for achieving equality. We called our report Unfinished Democracy because we need to ensure protections beyond those currently provided for in law and the Constitution to achieve equality. Other legislative change is required beyond this constitutional change. We have a Labour Party Bill down for next week, the Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Bill, which seeks to provide for a stronger recognition for the children of same-sex couples who are not currently covered in existing child and family relationships legislation. We hope we will have support from Government for that.  I recently attended the launch of the Cherish archive and was struck by the immense stigma and shame that surrounded cohabiting couples and children born outside of marriage for far too long. We have all acknowledged that and it is time our Constitution reflected a change in our society.  Since we are sharing experiences, I was a happy cohabitee for many years before finally taking the plunge to get married. Our family unit never felt any less of a family for not being based on marriage. It is really important that we recognise that. It is now mainstream for people to have children in all sorts of different settings and relationships, and it is important that we recognise families in that way.  We are debating how we get to that point. I thank the Minister for his answer on why he is putting forward an amendment to Article 41.1. I note he wants to do this in an affirmative way and not just the more straightforward or simple deletion that we have proposed. Our deletion approach would de-link the definition of family from marriage; I think that is clear. In our view, it would enable a more expansive definition of family in an affirmative way. The concern might be that reinserting a qualifying provision on family would be more restrictive than a simple deletion. The Minister described the phrase ""whether based on marriage or on other durable relationships"" as a guardrail. Perhaps it might be interpreted in a more restrictive way. As somebody said to me, they will not be able to know if they are in a family because it will depend on the court's definition of ""durable relationship"". I seek further clarity. The Minister has pointed out that in the Government's view the use of the phrase ""durable relationship"" is not related to the EU definition of durable relationship. What will stop the courts taking a different view and re-coupling it with the EU directive? I want the Minister to clarify the legal basis for this being used in a different setting to the EU directive setting. In his speech on Second Stage, he pointed out that there are many instances where a different definition is used in EU law than in Irish law. In EU law, a regulation is one of the strongest legal tools but in Irish law a regulation is of less strength than a Bill, an item of primary legislation. Can we be clear that the courts will know this is not to be interpreted in the same way as in an EU setting and just covers horizontal relationships within a couple context? On Second Stage, Deputy Carroll MacNeill asked why not use the term ""enduring"" instead of ""durable"". That would clearly be very different to the EU legal term and would have the same meaning. I am again struck by the quality not quantity approach the Minister mentioned. This is not about duration in terms of time, but rather in terms of strength, intensity and level of commitment. Another Government Deputy – I think it was the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, used the phrase ""committed relationship"". The term ""enduring"" or ""committed"" could have been used instead of ""durable"". This is something that will come up in the debates on the referendum. Given that we are here with the same aim, namely, to change the Constitution to ensure that families are recognised beyond families based on marriage and looking back at our long history and so on, we want to make sure that in the debate we can be clear about why the term ""durable relationship"" is used."	spk_238

Ivana Bacik	56	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2024-01-17	dail	33	Fortieth Amendment of the Constitution (Care) Bill 2023: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_19	"I will speak to our amendment, which is amendment No. 2. I very much welcome the debate and the introduction of a Bill to amend Article 41 in respect of two things - the current sexist language within it, which refers to a woman as having a life within the home and mothers as having duties within the home. The language in Article 41.2° of the Constitution has long been regarded as outdated, anachronistic and sexist. It is based upon gender stereotypes which should have no place in a contemporary constitutional text, confining women and mothers to lives and duties within the home and not referring at all to fathers as having any role or responsibilities in the home. This 40th amendment Bill seeks to change that to delete and replace that language with a different text. That is very welcome. Again, as with the 39th amendment Bill, I want to stress that we are extremely supportive of the aim behind the Government’s proposal here, but again our amendment seeks to explore in a constructive manner how best to achieve that end: to delete the sexist language but also to ensure that there is a meaningful recognition of care, both care within and outside the home. I speak not only for my Labour Party colleagues but I also refer back to my role as Chair of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality, which was established by the Oireachtas on a cross-party basis. Members of the committee are here in this House. Our committee was charged with exploring the recommendations of the Citizens’ Assembly on Gender Equality. We took the view right at the start on a cross-party basis that our role was to see how best to implement those recommendations. I commend the members of the citizens’ assembly because they took their work so seriously. They took a very strong view, first, that the sexist language about women and mothers should indeed be deleted, but that it should be replaced, crucially, with a recognition of the role of care. That care should be recognised and valued both within the home and in the wider community. That was very clear in their recommendations and we took that up, explored it, had extensive engagement with different groupings – carers, women’s groups, groups representing disabled persons. We had extensive engagement and with cross-party support we devised a wording which we regarded as effective in expressing the wishes of the citizens’ assembly and in ensuring that we would have a meaningful recognition of care in the Constitution for the first time on a gender-neutral basis, but one that would recognise care both in and outside of the home. Our proposal is what is reflected in the Labour Party’s amendment No. 2, which simply restates the recommendation from our Oireachtas joint committee.We recommended that the current language, which is that the State recognises that by her life within the home, a woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved, would be changed and replaced with: ""The State recognises that care within and outside the home and family gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved."" That gives a recognition of care and a recognition of care outside of the home and family. The second clause we wanted to replace is the clause that currently states the State shall therefore endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home. Again, we all recognise that as deeply outdated and paternalistic language, speaking about mothers having duties in the home and if they engage in labour, it is to neglect their duties in the home. That has no relevance now to the real lives of women and of men who share duties in the home and who are equally engaged in labour outside the home. The clause we propose to replace that states: ""The State shall therefore take reasonable measures to support care within and outside the home and family."" In our report, Unfinished Democracy: Achieving Gender Equality, launched in December 2022, we put forward clear reasoning behind that text. Indeed, we had explored different formulations of the text in an interim report we prepared earlier in 2022. In the interim report, we used language that the citizens' assembly had used calling on recognition of care within the home and the wider community. After consultation with constitutional experts, stakeholder groups and persons with lived experience of both receiving and providing care, we took the view that the phrase ""wider community"" lacked precise or established legal definition and that it would be preferable to implement the spirit of the recommendation by reference to care both within and outside the home and family, using language that is already in the Constitution but expanding our recognition of care. We were also mindful of the need to ensure that we did not set up any inadvertent hierarchy of rights. Recognising the rights of the carer, as we know from constitutional experience, could have set up a hierarchy and could have meant for example that those receiving care would have their rights in some way diminished or made inferior. We were careful, therefore, not to use ""care"" as a verb, rather, to use ""care"" as a noun and as a concept. We took submissions on this from many of those with lived experience of receiving and providing care.  The text we proposed, which we are using again in this amendment, also provides for the State to take reasonable measures to support care. We were mindful here of ensuring respect for the separation of powers to ensure we were not tying the hands of the Executive or placing any undue burden or any undue restriction on decision-making about allocation of resources by the Government or indeed by legislators. The phrase, ""take reasonable measures to support care"", was, we believed, an appropriate phrase to use that would have a meaningful recognition of care but would leave to the Executive the ultimate decision of the measures to take and would leave the courts of course with an overarching role. That was the most effective wording we could have used. We were mindful of considering Article 42 on education where there is reference to ""reasonable aid"". We know that language like ""endeavour to give aid"" is used in other constitutional articles.  As I expressed on Second Stage, we in the Labour Party and many of us on the committee were disappointed that the Government's proposed amendment falls short of the care proposal we made in two particular ways. The first is that the definition of ""care"" is less expansive and more restrictive. The Government's definition would confine constitutionally recognised care to that provided by members of a family to one another by reason of the bonds that exist among them. The Minister and I have spoken about this previously. This refers to family with a small ""f"" and, therefore, would have a different and, presumably, more expansive definition than the definition of ""family"" which is capitalised earlier, in Article 41.1. The Minister is nodding. He might want to refer to that in his response.  That is the first way in which the proposed text on care is more restrictive. It is the first way in which our amendment would differ from the Government's proposal, albeit, as I stress, we are all looking to do the same thing which is to ensure a meaningful recognition of care. We proposed that care within and outside the home and family would be recognised.  The second way in which the Government's definition has fallen short of the citizens' assembly and the Oireachtas committee's definition is that the Government is proposing language that refers to the State as ""striving to support such provision"", whereas we had said, ""the State shall therefore take reasonable measures to support care."" Stronger language is again used in our text. I take the point made by the Minister on Second Stage where he said there is a strong obligation in his proposed Article 42B where the State is obliged to strive to support such provision. However, it is still not as strong as ""shall take reasonable measures to support care"". We have two questions. Why is the wording so different? Why is care so confined to ""care provided by members of the family to one another by reason of the bonds that exist among them""? Why is that language of ""strive"" less strong than the language of ""taking reasonable measures to support""? The first question relates to why the language is different.  Second, the Government amendment is being put and framed as enabling a progressive realisation of stronger support for care both within and outside the home, I presume. If that is the case, how is the Government proposing to provide for that progressive realisation? What are the measures the Government will propose outside of the Constitution to support care? What are the reasonable measures that the Government is proposing through legislation or through policy that will provide better valuing of, and better recognition for, care than is currently in place in Ireland? I am mindful that the citizens' assembly report placed immense value on care. It made important recommendations on how State supports for carers and for those receiving care can be strengthened. In the joint committee's report, we proposed an action plan for the Government with a timeframe as to how the citizens' assembly recommendations could be implemented to provide, for example, for much stronger provision of childcare; for much stronger provision of care for disabled persons; care that would also recognise agency and enable independent living; care for older persons; and better provision, pay and conditions for carers. The Government is falling short in so many ways. This is not Second Stage but we all are aware that carers are really the unsung heroes. They worked through Covid-19 and it became particularly evident then. We know that carers are unsung heroes and that those receiving care also require stronger support and stronger rights than is currently the case. We might think of the enormously long waiting lists that so many children are still experiencing in waiting for diagnoses, treatments and assessments. I visited a school in Sandymount before Christmas and saw the poor conditions that children there who have significant needs are enduring. These are the ways in which we are failing in care provision currently. It is in that context that we are going to have this debate in the run-up to the referendum.  It is important that we explore the wording the Government is proposing. Why is the Government proposing this particular wording? Why is it departing from the stronger wording from the citizens' assembly and from our committee? Crucially, what are the additional supports that the Government is proposing to give for care that we can hear a commitment on and that will enable us to campaign for the referendum as an incremental step towards a strong vision of care? In the Labour Party we have a strong vision about care, State support and State provision of care, and a Niamh Bhreathnach moment on childcare to guarantee every child in Ireland a preschool place in the same way we guarantee every child a primary and secondary school place. That is the sort of strong message and strong vision that could really underpin a referendum debate on amending Article 41.2. I want to finish by acknowledging again the National Women's Council, Family Carers Ireland, One Family, Treoir, and other organisations that have already come out and said they will be supporting this referendum. However, some have expressed concerns about weakness of language. I am thinking of, the free legal advice centres, FLAC, for example, that have expressed concern about disabled persons under the Government's provision being confined to having constitutionally recognised care just within a family that could weaken their independence and agency. That is an issue that will be raised. I am raising these questions constructively. We are putting forward this amendment to reflect the wording our committee recommended. I am conscious that there is also a process difference. We recommended a replacement of Article 4.2 and I am interested as to why Government has proposed instead of deletion Article 41.2, the creation or insertion of a new Article 42(b) but that is much more of a technical point around the process. Our key questions are why the wording is so different and the care definition so much less expansive, and what the Government's proposals on care are that will enable us to see this as an incremental step towards a much stronger protection for care across Ireland."	spk_284

I think he has given us some helpful insights, particularly into the rationale for the wording chosen and for moving the clause into a new article 42B. That is certainly very helpful to hear, but just taking up that last point about ""strive"" or ""endeavour"", there is not much between those two words. I would say again that the wording that the Oireachtas joint committee unanimously agreed is in fact preferable to either ""strive"" or ""endeavour"" because we said the State shall therefore take reasonable measures to support care. We were using the mandatory language of ""shall"" and placing a much stronger action requirement to take reasonable measures to support care while being mindful, as the citizens' assembly was, of the need to ensure the separation of powers and that this does not in any way tie the hands of the Executive. Catherine Day told us that the citizens' assembly was very clear about that when it came up with the phrase ""take reasonable measures"". I still think that wording is preferable to either ""endeavour"" or ""strive"". Second, on the point of who is covered, it is helpful to hear the Minister confirm that the family in Article 42B is an expanded understanding of family, beyond that of the family in Article 41.1.It is, therefore, not confined to a unit founded on marriage or other durable relationships. It could cover the partner of a son or daughter, as the Minister said, but it will not cover somebody who provides care as a friend; that is clear. It will not cover somebody who provides care through charitable or voluntary organisations, through Meals on Wheels or community groupings that are not professional. I take the Minister's point; he does not want to confer constitutional rights on private companies. However, many forms of care are provided that are not provided on a commercial basis but are not provided within a family, however expansively defined, either. That is perhaps the missing piece. Time and again during our extensive committee hearings, we heard from older people, disabled persons and persons who receive support and care from a whole range of different carers in a whole range of different settings and the concern was that an exclusionary definition of care would not provide sufficient valuing of the immense work that carers do, both paid and unpaid, voluntary within the family and within friend groups. That was our concern in coming up with the definition that we came up with, which is reflected in our amendment. "	spk_325

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-12-14	dail	33	Thirty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution (The Family) Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_37	"I am glad to speak for the Labour Party on this important Bill, the Thirty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution (The Family) Bill 2023. My colleague Deputy Sherlock will speak for the Labour Party later on the second of the two referendum Bills, the Fortieth Amendment of the Constitution (Care) Bill 2023. I will make some reference to that Bill in my own contribution since the two referendums are to be held on the same date, arise from a common process and each would seek to amend the same article of the Constitution, that is, the family article. Indeed, the text in the thirty-ninth amendment Bill refers and is in some ways contingent upon the text in the fortieth amendment Bill. I am glad we have finally got to this point. It has been a long journey to get here. I, personally, have been very closely involved with this process for a long time. As Chairperson of the Oireachtas Special Committee on Gender Equality and previously as a practising and academic lawyer, I have researched and engaged extensively with the text that is now under scrutiny and which the Government is proposing to amend. I thank the Minister for his acknowledgment of the work we did in the committee. Indeed, Deputies Clarke and Cronin, who are in the Chamber, were also members of that committee along with others on a cross-party basis across the House. It is because of my long involvement with the process that I am so deeply concerned about the text we have been provided with in these Bills today. It is a real disappointment that the wording now proposed does not follow the recommendations of the citizens’ assembly or the Oireachtas committee. It will beg the question, particularly from the citizens and those many stakeholders who engaged with us, as to what all the engagement was for, if indeed the text was to depart so significantly from that which we and the citizens' assembly before us recommended. We heard from so many witnesses, including stakeholders, experts and persons with lived experience of inequality. The citizens' assembly before us had also done so. The citizens delivered clear recommendations and we delivered a clear action plan building on those recommendations. It is exactly one year ago this month that the committee produced a draft wording of the proposed constitutional amendment text, which had cross-party support and civil society buy-in. It is, therefore, deeply disappointing that the wording proposed today has departed so significantly from those recommendations. It could be described as a missed opportunity. Indeed, this is not just my view. I refer to the views expressed by so many more. Dr. Laura Cahillane pointed out, when the wording was announced, that the Government had ""fudged an opportunity to do something [more] positive"". Other commentators have been critical of some of the language used, particularly on the care referendum but also some of the language in this thirty-ninth amendment Bill. I will speak briefly about the process that has led us to this point by way of setting a context before turning to the wording in the Bill. As I said, we published our report one year ago. Our committee had been tasked with examining the report of the citizens' assembly. That assembly, chaired by Dr. Catherine Day, met during Covid pandemic times between January 2020 and April 2021. In 2021, it produced a final report setting out a total of 45 recommendations for wide-ranging change and a really clear pathway to achieving gender equality. The largest group of recommendations, numbered 4 to 19, related to care and social protection, which is a measure of how significantly the assembly viewed these issues and of how gendered both care and social protection are.Members of the assembly told me and others that because their deliberations had taken place during Covid, this had particularly emphasised the central role that care plays in all our communities. Like others, I want to pay tribute to the citizens who took such time and gave such commitment to their deliberations in producing their recommendations. Their first three recommendations provide a clear framework for amending the text of the Constitution. It should be said that they proposed an amendment to Article 40.1 – the equality guarantee. They asked us to change that to refer explicitly to gender equality and non-discrimination. Just to note, it is a matter of some regret that the Government has simply ruled out acting upon that recommendation. Both the assembly and our committee considered that Article 40.1 should be amended, but that, I accept, is for another day. We are faced now with the two recommendations of the assembly related to Article 41. They asked us to amend Article 41 to protect private and family life, with the protection afforded to the family not to be limited to the marital family. The text in the Bill is within that context. They also asked us to delete the gender-specific language in Article 41.2 of the Constitution and replace it with an obligation on the State to take reasonable measures to support care within the home and wider community. Our committee took the view, when we were set up following the assembly report, that our mandate was to provide proposals on the most effective way to implement the assembly’s recommendations. We produced what we called a ""blueprint"" or ""action plan"" for implementation. We called our report ""Unfinished Democracy"", because we believed that until we achieved a truly gender equal society, our democracy in Ireland would remain unfinished. We endorsed the need for the constitutional changes proposed by the assembly, and even went so far as to draft and provide the Government with precise wording for replacement text to give effect to the changes proposed to Article 41. We called on the Minister and on the Government to move swiftly to hold the necessary referendum before the end of 2023. As the Minister has acknowledged, there has been, it must be said, a somewhat unexplained delay over the months since then. It is regrettable that it was only, in fact, last week, in early December, that we finally had sight of the wording, having initially been promised the referendum would take place in November of this year. The wording is disappointing. The timeframe is of concern. We have only 85 days between now and 8 March. There can, however, be no doubt that we need to amend Article 41. I absolutely agree with the Minister's words. The Minister spoke powerfully about the shameful legacy within this State, our treatment of women, our treatment of single-parent families and our treatment of all those families who did not conform to that constitutional model of family based upon marriage. It is widely agreed that the restrictive nature of the language used to define ""Family"" in Article 41 does not reflect the real diversity of modern family life and wonderful diversity of family forms in Ireland. It is also widely agreed that the language used in Article 41.2 referring to women and mothers is sexist, outdated and anachronistic. Article 41.3.1, on the family, currently provides that ""The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack."" Thus, only those families based on marriage are offered constitutional protection. As we know, this restrictive definition has had a really severe impact upon families and has reinforced discrimination. I refer to the particular tragic case of Johnny O’Meara, with which the Minister will be familiar. Mr. O'Meara is a father of three from Nenagh, County Tipperary, whose partner, Michelle Batey, sadly died from cancer in 2021. They had been together for 20 years. Like over 150,000 other couples across Ireland, they were cohabiting and had not married. Both were working, paying PRSI and contributing to the system, but Johnny was not legally entitled to the support of the widower's pension upon Michelle's death, because they were not married. This legal position, this lack of entitlement, was reinforced by the constitutionally restrictive definition of family. It is particularly unfair, of course, because the State recognises cohabitation in other realms within the social welfare support. Johnny O’Meara courageously took his case to the High Court. He lost there in October 2022. Looking at the judgment, in the words of Mr. Justice Heslin, the State had made a ""legitimate decision ... to support, not families, but those who made the choice to enter ... the marriage contract"". Johnny appealed that decision to the Supreme Court where legal argument was heard there, most recently, as we know, in October. The judgment is awaited in that case, but it illustrates the practical impact of laws which discriminate against those who are not married who are cohabiting. I and my Labour colleagues, in particular, Deputy Alan Kelly, have long championed Johnny O'Meara's case and called out the lack of welfare supports for unmarried couples as a stain on Irish society. We need to address the situation to provide equality for all families. One important way to do this is through amending the ""Family"" definition in Article 41, but how this is done is important. We are all agreed on the need for change. I will return to Chapter 1 of our committee report where we set out the three considerations that guided us in devising this wording that we drafted. Most unusually, and, I think, uniquely in an Oireachtas committee process, we prepared wording. We were mindful of the need to take account of the views of stakeholders, civil society groups, experts and campaigners, and we did so. We also were mindful of the need to ensure that only those changes necessary to give effect to the citizens' assembly recommendations would be proposed. We wanted to be minimalist. We did not want to put in any extraneous language. Of course, we wanted to ensure that, as far as possible, the existing substance, language and text of the relevant constitutional provisions should be retained. We were trying to build on what is in the text. In keeping with these clear guidelines, we prepared what we described as a simple wording to amend Article 41.3. We did not see a need to amend Article 41.1 and I am interested that the Government has chosen this route. The Minister referred to that in his speech. I might ask for a little more clarity on that. I have concerns about the phrase used to limit the definition of family in the proposed new text for Article 41.1 that the Minister has proposed, namely the family ""whether founded on marriage or on other durable relationships."" Others have spoken on that phrase, ""durable relationships"", which does jump out. Unlike the language our committee used, the concept of ""durable relationships"" is new to the Constitution. I think I am right in saying it is new to constitutional jurisprudence in this country. Therefore, the Government has not followed the criteria we set. We devised those criteria, but I am interested to know why that particular consideration I have referred to was not embraced - the need to ensure that, as far as possible, the existing substance, language and text should be retained. Nor do I see how it is necessary to insert the phrase into Article 41.1 at all when, instead, the approach we took was to insert the more expansive text in Article 41.3.1°, where we proposed a text saying, ""The State pledges itself to guard with special care the Family, including but not limited to the marital family."" That Article 41.3.1°, therefore, makes clear that the ""Family"" protected in Article 41.1 is to be defined in this more expansive way without the need for a separate amending text to Article 41.1. Some members of the committee thought that introducing the phrase ""marital family"" might itself be problematic and we thought that was a worthy point. We proffered an alternative, even more straightforward approach - merely to delete the phrase ""on which the Family is founded"" from the existing text of Article 41.3.1° - to remove that provision related to marriage. Taking either of those approaches, in our view, would enable recognition of the more expansive definition of family, no longer limited to the family based on marriage. It would also potentially remove a key justification upon which a discriminatory approach by the State against cohabiting couples, such as Johnny O’Meara and Michelle Batey, might be based. We wanted, therefore, to take the minimalist approach to amending the Constitution to ensure that more expansive definition of family would be possible. My questions are as follows. First, why the need to make changes to both Article 41.1 and 41.3.1°? Second, why use this more complex text, referring to durable relationships? Why introduce that new phrase when a more straightforward approach, in our view, could have been chosen? Crucially, can we be sure that the text offered by the Government would provide protection for those who may find themselves in the awful situation faced by Johnny O’Meara and his three children? In Labour, we are not convinced that the wording the Minister has proposed is the preferable one, and we are concerned about the text that is being used. We are currently considering the prospect of bringing amendments on Committee Stage to this Bill - I think others are too - to better reflect the wishes of the citizens’ assembly, its recommendations and, indeed, the wording agreed by the gender equality committee. Furthermore, we reserve the right to take a position on the referendum campaign itself once we have concluded that Oireachtas scrutiny of this Bill and, indeed, the care Bill. Deputy Sherlock will speak in more detail on our view on the Fortieth Amendment of the Constitution (Care) Bill 2023, but the same points can be made. We have real concerns about how the text proposed in that Bill departs from the text that we had proffered at the committee hearings, a text which in our view closely reflected the recommendations of the citizens' assembly.Our text would have replaced the sexist language in 41.2, which we all know is based on outdated gender stereotypes and should have no place in a contemporary constitutional text. We are all agreed on that, which is very welcome. Our text would have gone further in recognising care than the proposed text in the Government Bill. The wording which we had proposed would replace the current article 41.2 with two clauses, the first saying that: ""The State recognises that care within and outside the home and Family gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved."" and paragraph 2 saying: ""The State shall, therefore, take reasonable measures to support care within and outside the home and Family."" As with the 39th amendment and the family provision, we took the view that, as far as possible, we will stick to the text in the Constitution. That is why we used that phrase ""within and outside the home and family"". We did not use the phrase ""wider community"". We had originally proposed that in our interim report in July 2022 but we got feedback and spoke with experts and stakeholders. The feedback we received suggested that the phrase ""wider community"" lacked a precise or established legal definition and that the spirit of the recommendation could be implement more effectively by reference to care both within and outside the home and family. It was expansive but not prescriptive. It is the same principle, I would argue, that arises when we look at the phrase ""durable relationship"" in the 39th amendment Bill. It is not a phrase which has that precise and established legal meaning which I think we need. We are also very conscious of the need to ensure that the word ""care"" would be used to encompass consideration of the rights both of those being cared for and of those providing care so that we do not set up a hierarchy where carers rights are protected above the rights of those seeking care. We are concerned that the Government's proposed text on care is far more restrictive. It would confine constitutionally recognised care to that provided by members of a family to one another by reason of the bonds that exist among them. Of course this is family with a small ""f"" and is so different and presumably more expansive than ""family"" in 40.1.1. The Government’s proposed text has received at best lukewarm support from civil society groups, which might have been expected to show an enthusiastic welcome for this announcement. The National Women’s Council said it is ""consulting its members"" which is not exactly a resounding endorsement of a text. The trade unions might have been expected to support a text which creates a more inclusive recognition of care both within and outside the home and family. We do not hear resounding support from the trade union movement. We had achieved a buy-in and support from across civil society and the trade union movement with the text in our report. We are really concerned that many people will be excluded from this constitutional provision as a result of a more restrictive approach. The definition which the Government has provided will exclude not only those who work for for-profit caring agencies, which it will exclude, but it will also exclude those who work for charities, voluntary organisations and carers like home helps or Meals on Wheels volunteers. I do not see how the bonds definition can include carers who are friends, for example. I know that we have discussed in other settings the sorts of relationships that might be encompassed by the new 42B. Time and again, however, during the course of our committee hearings we heard older people, disabled persons and people who receive support and care from a whole range of different carers, both within and outside of the family, friends and volunteers, those who work for charities, for church groups and for others, and the concern is that an exclusionary definition of care will serve to emphasise and undervalue that care which is provided. We are very keen to work with the Minister on this. He has said that he would support care outside the home in other ways if this referendum is passed but we need to hear more about how that is going to be done because of we all know the shortfalls and shortcomings in care provision in so many ways, for children with special needs, for older persons and for people with disabilities. We are concerned that having this more restrictive definition of care will simply not meet the needs of those who came before our committee and I just want to be fair to them and to the citizens' assembly. Finally, I want to deal with the issue of a serious technical flaw in the wording for 42B. When read aloud, in particular, it becomes grammatically problematic. There is a flaw. The wording is cumbersome and there is an issue with that. Others have spoken in other settings about the separation of powers and, indeed, the Tánaiste referred to that earlier in talking about the referendum. We were very clear that the phrase we used: ""The State [will] ... take reasonable measures to support care within and outside the home and Family"" is not prescriptive and does not tie the hands of the Executive, or cede decision-making on the resource allocation to the courts. Again that was something the Tánaiste referred to earlier. I want to address that. Neither the wording we proposed on 41.3 or 41.2 would in any way obstruct or undermine the separation of powers. It is clearly leaving to the Executive the crucial decision on resource allocation. ""Reasonable measures to support care"" is in our view a measured phrase that has a resonance within constitutional jurisprudence but that does not tie the hands of the Executive. For all of these reasons, and wanting to stay true to the process that has led us thus far, through the citizens' assembly and through the Oireachtas committee, we want to indicate that the Labour Party is looking at amendments to put down to both Bills, the 39th and the 40th amendment Bills, and we are looking at how we can better reflect the consensual wording which was achieved, building on the spirit of the citizens' assembly recommendations. We are trying to ensure that we genuinely come to a constitutional change which really reflects the wonderful diversity of family life in Ireland today and the wonderful diversity of care provision in Ireland today also."	spk_327

It is appalling to see that the conference is still running on as we speak due to the failure to reach an agreement, a failure that appears to have resulted from the sabotage of a stronger draft wording which has clearly been corrupted and scuttled by oil barons and petrostates. This is deeply concerning because we all know it is not enough merely to reduce our consumption of dirty fossil fuels. We must phase them out altogether. While events like COP are important, we need to be judged by our actions and not just our words. As Dr. Cara Augustenborg points out in  The challenge is urgent but, all too often, there is a perception that the onus of change and of picking up the pieces are left to individuals and local communities, with big businesses getting off scot-free. We need to hold companies to account. Not only do we need to meet our legally binding targets for the sake of the planet, but by doing so we are improving our lives and communities. We know we need to address the health implications of fossil fuels too. We have the highest asthma diagnosis rates in Europe and dirty air has been linked to premature deaths across our urban centres. So much of this is driven by fossil fuel consumption. Will the Government support a global treaty to phase out fossil fuels? Will it oppose what it seems is a plan for the next COP to be held in another petrostate? Will the Government take the necessary action at home to meet our emissions reduction targets? Will it introduce the Labour Party's €9 per month climate ticket to help support a move away from fossil fuel transport? Will it further incentivise cycling and active travel infrastructure to give our climate targets meaning?	spk_5

The Taoiseach's Government has fallen short on ensuring outcomes are there in place. I repeat again the question. Will the Government oppose the holding of COP 29 in another petro-state? We hope very much that we will see a stronger text emerge from the negotiations today at COP 28 but it is likely that if COP 29 is again held in a petro-state next year as is planned, or the next event, that we will see similar fudging and similar roll backs on the strong text that should be there to phase out fossil fuels, which is the text that Mary Robinson and so many more have called for. There is more that has to be done at home to ensure that the transition is a just one, to address the socioeconomic impacts of climate change for our poorest communities and our most disadvantaged communities. I echo the calls of my colleague, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, who has called for a task force to investigate here at home in Ireland how the climate crisis will impact on our most disadvantaged communities and what supports the Government has to put in place to ensure there is that just transition.

The Government is pricing far too many people out of a home and could do much more to address this, such as by passing our Labour Party Bill to implement the Kenny report, or by launching a proactive construction recruitment programme to bring in more construction workers. Yet, we know that some of the price increases that people face when trying to buy a home are driven by delays and flaws in the planning system. I want to focus on planning. Planning law in Ireland should be fit for purpose but our planning system is broken, mired in controversy, highly centralised and desperately slow. It is unfit to meet the needs of our growing population. The Minister acknowledged this when he promised us radical reforms but the Planning and Development Bill falls well short of the mark. He dropped the ""use it or lose it"" clause. There are concerns about the constitutionality of some aspects of the Bill. It will not address some key failures in our planning system. I want to hear more from the Minister about real reforms, such as on the Labour Party’s proposal to crack down on bribery in our planning system of the sort that was exposed by “RTÉ Investigates” on Monday night. The Taoiseach told me on Tuesday that he was not convinced that a new stand-alone offence was required on this and we in the Labour Party disagree. It is vital that we crack down on planning corruption. Those who exploit the planning system for personal gain are not only making a quick buck off developers, they are also profiting at the expense of all those who want to move into a home of their own but who are locked out due to costs and delays. The actions of those who abuse the planning system increase the ultimate price for everyone. They increase the ultimate price of homes for us all. It is incumbent on the State to crack down on such practices but it seems that is not happening.  Last night, I was alerted to a concerning, recent and ongoing case. I was shown evidence of a party seeking to use the planning process to coerce a developer to pay more than €500,000 into an escrow account, in exchange for the withdrawal of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála. The party also insisted on the use of a confidentiality clause to cover it up. This feels like a return to the bad old days. In the correspondence I received, I saw evidence that this issue was brought to the attention of An Bord Pleanála months ago, but that no further action arose from it at the time. As legislators, we have to act to address abuses within the planning system. We have to ensure that our planning system is not open to this sort of abuse because where it impacts in particular on residential developments, it is people who lose out and it is very serious. Is the Minister aware of cases of abuse like this within the planning system? What action does he propose to take to address them? Does the Minister now see the need to adopt our Labour Party amendment to the Planning and Development Bill to make this sort of behaviour a stand-alone offence? How else does the Minister propose to put an end to this sort of grubby deal and ensure our planning system is fit for purpose to deliver the homes and public infrastructure we badly need? "	spk_214

- undertake a review of the cost of caring and assess how current social insurance schemes for illness, disability and carers can be efficiently used to provide income supplements to carers in Ireland to address rising costs of caring, and in the interim increase thresholds from 18.5 to 22.5 hours per week if an individual receives Carers Allowance, Carers Benefit or the Carer Support Grant, and this review must be completed before the cessation of this Dáil session and consider:- develop individualised means-testing for Carer's Allowance and increase thresholds to include the costs of caring and to reflect a more needs led payment including how to provide additional access for full time family carers to Back to School and fuel allowance, and in the interim introduce a living wage/basic income for carers by increasing Carer's Allowance to the equivalent amount of the artists basic income at €325;- introduce ""Care Credits"" for people who do not qualify for Carer's Allowance but should still accrue credits in order to remain within the social protection system;- develop a central database of individuals who have applied for or who are actively aware of who needed a disability service, such as a residential service, enhanced support in an existing residential place, or other non-residential services such as respite or home support that fully captures the level of unmet need in the system;- introduce care coordinators within local health areas;- introduce a mechanism under the Fair Deal scheme to develop an equitable system for community/long-term care as well as developing discharge planning; and- ensure that the promised referendum to amend Article 41 of the Constitution of Ireland to provide for the value of care in society is held in 2023.As the proposer of the motion, I will contribute to open the debate and to close it, as I understand, and I very much welcome the opportunity to do so. This is an important motion, as the Minister of State is aware. It originates from the recommendations of the Irish Women's Parliamentary Caucus, of which I am honoured to be vice chairperson, or deputy chair. It is in this role I am proposing the motion today and closing the debate on the floor of the House. I pay tribute to the chairperson of the women's caucus, Senator Fiona O'Loughlin, and to the secretariat, and in particular Eva Nolan and Brenda McCauley ,who played an important role in drafting the motion with input from the caucus working group. I must also put on record that the existence of the caucus is very important. We established it in the previous Dáil and Seanad term with Deputy Catherine Martin, now Minister, as our chairperson. I was honoured to be part of the caucus during that parliamentary session also. The caucus played a very strong role in supporting me when I chaired the Vótáil 100 programme in 2018 to mark and celebrate the centenary of women's suffrage in Ireland. The women's caucus has been a very important entity and I am really glad to see it continuing to play an integral role within the Oireachtas in carrying out actions such as drafting this motion and ensuring that care is to the fore in our work in the Oireachtas. Gratitude is also owed to the many stakeholders who contributed to the text of this motion, to individuals and organisations including Family Carers Ireland, Professor Ursula Barry, and many others. As the former chairperson of the special Oireachtas Committee on Gender Equality, the issues that feature in this motion are close to my heart because of course care was very essential to the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality and thus very central to our recommendations within the Oireachtas Committee on Gender Equality. That citizens assembly was chaired by Dr. Catherine Day and their report produced 45 recommendations. Our work as a special committee over the course of 2022 was focused upon devising an action plan for the implementation of the 45 recommendations. In our view, those recommendations amounted to a blueprint for achieving a truly gender equal Ireland. It is almost exactly one year ago, on 15 December 2022, that we launched our report from the Oireachtas Committee on Gender Equality, which we called Unfinished Democracy because until we achieve an equal society in which men and women are truly equal, our democracy will be unfinished. Nowhere is that more evident than in this Chamber where fewer than one quarter of our TDs are women. That is shamefully low at 23%. My by-election in July 2021 brought the numbers up to 23%, and now it is 37 out of 160. We very much hope to see a higher number and higher proportion of women TDs in the next Dáil. We do need to ensure more equal representation of women and of men. At the launch of our report last year, where we made the point very forcefully about the lack of women in politics along with our recommendations on care and other issues, we saw the Leinster House AV room packed with stakeholders from civil society groups, academics, and many of those who lived experience of gender discrimination and who had engaged with us and with the citizens' assembly. We heard from those present at the launch of our report one year ago a strong expression of a real desire to see the report's recommendations implemented and to see the actions that we had recommended taken up by the Government and progressed over the coming term. We are now a year on and while there has been some progress, we see there is still a long way to go. In that context, I did welcome the announcement by the Government this week of progress on the referendum we had recommended to amend the Constitution and in particular to amend Article 41.Our recommendations built on recommendations numbers 1 to 3 of the citizens' assembly. The assembly recommended that Article 41 be amended to delete the sexist text that stereotypes women and mothers in Article 41.2; it also recommended the replacement of that sexist text by a clause enabling a true recognition of the value of care in the home and wider community. Another crucial recommendation on constitutional change was to provide for a more inclusive definition of ""family"" beyond the family based on marriage. I welcomed progress this week finally with the Government announcement, one year on from our report, that it would hold a referendum on these recommendations relating to Article 41 in March of next year. Nonetheless, I was disappointed the recommendation on the care reform of Article 41.2 fell short of what we and the citizens' assembly recommended. The definition of ""care"" the Government proposes in its new Article 42B is limited to care between members of a family. That is not sufficiently expansive to cover the real diversity of care provision. We heard, for example, about care provided by family members and voluntary carers, as well as that provided by those paid to provide care work. There is a myriad of ways in which care is provided and needed by individuals and society. It is disappointing the Government wording falls short of what we and the citizens' assembly recommended. We achieved a cross-party consensus on the wording we proposed last year. Civil society groups by and large strongly supported it too. It is a missed opportunity this week. We should have seen a celebration from civil society of the announcement of the referendum; instead, we are seeing at best a lukewarm response, with groups like the National Women’s Council saying it will consult with members on the care proposal. The provision to extend the definition of ""family"" is welcome. We will tease out the wording. It is not quite the wording we recommended but it is a change we can all welcome wholeheartedly and which will address cases like the sad case of Johnny O’Meara, which I have raised many times in this House. That is important. He was not eligible, it seemed, for State benefits because he and his partner had not been married before she tragically died. The motion deals with care on a much broader basis and in responding at the end of the debate I hope to address the other issues dealt with in the motion. The motion draws from the Joint Committee on Disability Matters and from our gender equality committee. Its primary focus is monitoring Ireland’s implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Ireland signed up to that convention in 2007 and ratified it in 2018, but it will not be controversial to say in this House it does not yet permeate our care systems. The Minister of State will probably agree with that. Our care system continues not to meet the needs or protect the human rights of disabled persons. I have come, as others have, from outside the front gate of the Dáil, where we were met with a coalition of disabled persons organisations coming together under the banner of scrapping the Green Paper on disability reform produced by the Department of Social Protection. There is a growing momentum of concern among disability rights and disabled persons organisations about the Green Paper. Will the Minister of State address that? I committed to the organisations I would raise that on the floor of this House. Our other event this morning relevant to this debate was the launch by the family carers organisation of its score card for 2023. I was glad to attend that this morning and hear poignant stories of failings in the care system, particularly for parents of children with disabilities, and ways in which we are still not meeting the needs of such children in our school system or our care system more generally. This important motion raises concerns about the issues I have just referenced, namely, the concerns disabled persons have about social protection and the concerns family carers have about lack of supports, particularly for children with special needs or disabilities. Some of the key calls in the motion relate to the needs of disabled persons and children with special needs. On home care workers, Labour recently tabled a motion in this House seeking greater support from Government for those providing care in the home, employed by HSE or by organisations contracted by the HSE. Home care workers are many of the unsung heroes in our healthcare and social care services. They are underpaid, overworked and there is not enough of them. There have been issues with recruitment, as was raised in the Dáil debate on the Labour motion. Much of that relates to better pay and conditions. That needs to be addressed. I will raise more issues in the follow-up but I ask the Minister of State whether progress has been made on pay parity for those working and providing care in section 39 and other organisations contracted by the HSE. The workers do the same work as HSE employees but do not, in many cases, get the same level of recognition. I look forward to returning to some of these issues at the end of the debate."	spk_292
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-12-07	dail	33	Delivery of a Rights-Based Care Economy in Ireland: Motion	dbsect_33	I am honoured, as deputy chairperson of the Women's Parliamentary Caucus, to close the debate today, having proposed this important motion on a rights-based care economy. I thank all those colleagues from across the House who spoke on this important motion and the Ministers of State, Deputies Butler and Browne, for providing us with a Government response. Undoubtedly, there is a great deal being done but, unfortunately, there are still many gaps in the system. While I acknowledge the progress being made, having listened to my colleagues who have spoken, it is fair to say that we are falling far short, particularly for children with special needs and the thousands of children who are still awaiting a first assessment. Across our constituencies, we hear all the time from the parents of children who cannot get a special needs place or supports to enable their kids to fulfil their potential in our education system. Earlier today, at a Family Carers Ireland event, listened to the poignant testimony of a parent who cares for a child with special needs. It was profoundly moving to hear the hoops she has had to jump through and the obstacles put in her way to ensure that care would be provided. We are still falling far short of the care that her child, like so many other children, needs. We are falling short in the provision of care for children and older persons. I note the Minister of State spoke about progress in reducing the numbers waiting for home care supports. Even according to the Government's own figures, over 3,000 new applicants who were approved for funding are still awaiting home supports. That is in addition to the 2,900 people who are receiving supports but not yet the maximum hours advised. The Minister of State will agree that it is simply not good enough that in 2023, we have so many older people, younger people and children who are not being provided adequate levels of care. The gendered nature of care was at the forefront of the minds of members of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality and members of the Oireachtas Committee on Gender Equality. It is not a coincidence that of the 45 recommendations on gender equality made by the committee, 16 related specifically to care and social protection. We also made a recommendation on constitutional change in respect of care, which I will speak about in a moment. The reason 16 of the recommendations related to care and social protection is that the committee report, in the chapter on care and social protection, point out that while Ireland has seen a cultural shift in attitudes to care, women remain disproportionately responsible for unpaid care. Even in the workplace, women are over-represented in poorly paid care work sectors. For working parents, this can present significant challenges and women are most disadvantaged by those challenges. Lone parents face particular obstacles. Of course, in recognising that gender balance, the needs and rights of those receiving care must also be respected and supported in our laws and policies. That consideration was paramount for us in the Women's Parliamentary Caucus in bringing forward this motion. The motion calls for a rights-based care economy. Some of the key demands we make in it include the immediate establishment of the commission on care and for its remit to be extended to include all types of care, including disability care and the delivery of rights-based care in line with the UNCRPD. The Minister of State confirmed that the commission on care for older persons would finally get under way in January of next year. We are very glad to see progress at last. I understand the Minister of State also said the chairperson was in the process of being appointed. Again, that is welcome.However, we need to ensure that the commission addresses the intersectional issues, not just relating to older age but also relating to disability, to older persons who may have a disability or who may become disabled later in life. We also need to look at other issues relating to class and geographic area because we know that care is not consistently provided across the country. We want to see the sort of rights-based care that is fit for the 21st century provided to older persons and persons with disabilities - the sort envisaged by the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, originally pioneered by a Labour Party Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, who charted a way forward for a rights-based model of care. I have spoken about the need to ensure support for those who work in home care and I note the Minister of State's comments on that. We are concerned that some carers are still not getting the living wage. I know Government is moving on that. The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, also came back on the issue of section 39, section 56 and section 10 workers but we are still not hearing about parity of pay and conditions being provided for those workers, which they deserve because they provide such vital support across society. We are concerned about the fair deal, which we touched on. We need to ensure the fair deal is not just skewed towards institutional care. Under the fair deal scheme, we can develop an equitable system for care in the home and for community-based care settings. As many speakers have said, in addition to real concern about potential for abuse in institutional settings, most of us would simply much prefer to be cared for at home. I spoke earlier about being outside and meeting a coalition of disabled persons' organisations coming together under the banner of scrapping the Green Paper on disability reform. I do not believe the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, addressed those concerns, but I ask her to take them on board. One of the women outside told me that she did not want to be put into a nursing home. She is receiving care in her home and that is exactly where the focus should be under the fair deal and all Government policies on care. Those with disabilities and those in older age must be supported to remain at home. Obviously, this is not only better for those individuals, but it is also better for our economy because it is much less costly and people have much better health outcomes where they are enabled and supported to stay at home. The programme for Government included a welcome commitment to deliver a carer's guarantee to enable family carers to deliver a core basket of services. We want to see that implemented; it will be very welcome when we do see it. In 2021, Government acknowledged the cost of disability and that must also be recognised in the commission on care. The report from the gender equality committee called for adequate data to be maintained on care. The submissions of stakeholder groups highlighted the lack of data on care, meaning that the Government is really hampered in trying to develop the long-term planning that is needed. We do not have really robust data on the projected needs for care and the number of those providing care. This is an opaque area. I listened carefully to what both Ministers of State said on the constitutional change. I think I speak for all members of the committee in saying we are very disappointed the proposed new Article 42B will not recognise care beyond that provided within a family or by people with family bonds. The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has spoken about the care provided by people and the volunteers in organisations like meals on wheels. We all know those involved in them and the amazing work they do supporting and enabling older people to live at home. However, that sort of care provision will not be covered and will not be valued in the new Article 42B. The care provided by friends who have no family bonds but are providing care out of love nonetheless will not be covered by Article 42B, as I read it. Of course, the value of care provided by those who are paid to do so will not be recognised. We are creating a hierarchy of care. Dr. Laura Cahillane described the wording as a fudged opportunity which is a fair assessment. It is disappointing to hear that. I know the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has said that while that less expensive definition of care is covered in Article 42B, the Government aims to provide support for carers outside of that definition through other means. While we will not have time to hear it today, we need to hear from the Government what levels of support will be given to provide the care that will not be protected or valued in the new Article 42B in the Constitution. What supports will we see? Will we see the sorts of measures that the motion from the Women's Parliamentary Caucus suggests, that the gender equality committee suggested and that the citizens' assembly suggested? Those are the sorts of meaningful supports that would really make a difference to carers and to those who receive and need care. That level of support needs to be guaranteed and committed to for us to be sure that the definition is not so restrictive that it becomes utterly meaningless and we do not see the value of care in our society that is so badly needed. We need to recognise the gender dimension while also recognising the immense contribution that carers make to everyone in society. All of us have needed care in our childhood and all of us are likely to need care at some point during later life. There are many people who, during the course of their lives, will need care at various points. We are all conscious of the integral role of care in society. That was the impetus behind this motion from the Women's Parliamentary Caucus and it was really a driving force behind the work of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality and our work on the special committee. I hope we can hear more from the Minister of State and her colleagues in government over the course of the weeks and months ahead as to what level support will be provided for carers and, in particular, how we can ensure that we do not see thousands of children still continuing to wait for assessments and thousands of older people still waiting to receive necessary home care and supports so that they can live independently at home. I again thank everyone for supporting this motion.	spk_301
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-12-06	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	This week, we have seen the humanitarian situation in Gaza worsen further. After a brief glimmer of hope last week with the humanitarian pauses, we have seen absolute devastation wreaked across the Gaza Strip, with reports of 16,000 people killed, including thousands of children. Gazans are facing a deepening horror, the UN tells us, as disease spreads, food is scarce and humanitarian aid is all but cut off. Volker Türk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that the situation is apocalyptic. His colleagues have described the situation as the remnants of a nation being driven into a pocket in the south. UN officials have been told to empty warehouses of goods and move on. Where to go? There is nowhere to go for people in Gaza. Nearly all of us in the House condemned the brutal attack by Hamas when it was carried out on 7 October. Nothing excuses Israel's brutal retaliation, bombardment and carpet bombing of Gaza. Israel's breach of international law and resultant commission of war crimes have effectively turned Gaza into a city of ruin. That was what Netanyahu threatened on 7 October. That threat has now been realised, with unthinkable consequences for many civilians who have been forced to leave their homes and see their friends, family and children killed. They have seen buildings and infrastructure turned into rubble. Hospitals and UN facilities have been targeted. There is seemingly no end in sight, two months on from the onset of the most recent war. While many of us have been proud of Ireland's strong stance in support of Palestinian rights and support the Government on that, we now urge the Government to do more because it can do more. We are all continuing to receive correspondence from people across the country who want the Government to do more and are urging a stronger stance at international level, and here in Ireland, from the Government. We want a stronger response from Ireland, pushing at EU level, to ensure other EU member states can be brought on board to seek the crucial goal of a permanent humanitarian ceasefire. Will the Taoiseach update the House on his Government's response to what are now genocidal policies being conducted by Netanyahu and his government? Will he tell us how he is going to work at European Council next week to ensure that pressure is brought to bear on his colleagues? I am conscious that Fine Gael is a member of the European People's Party, the largest grouping in the European Parliament. The President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, is drawn from the European People's Party. We know that at the European Council next week, EU leaders are to discuss the situation in the Middle East. What will the Taoiseach do at EU level to push for a ceasefire and put pressure on Netanyahu's government to ensure that we see an end to this horrific toll on civilians in Gaza?	spk_175

I am glad to hear the Taoiseach has confirmed he will be pressing at EU level next week for a text that will call for a permanent ceasefire and that will press for the two-state solution. His Government can do more, however, here at home as well. Senator Black's occupied territories Bill received cross-party support in the Seanad and, indeed, here in the Dáil, where Fianna Fáil and the Green Party supported it previously. Will the Taoiseach act now to bring that Bill through finally into law? He would have our support and, I think, support across the Opposition for that. Will he also recognise Palestinian statehood? He made the commitment in the programme for Government: “Honour our commitment to recognise the State of Palestine as part of a lasting settlement of the conflict.” Is not now the time to take this brave and bold action, unilaterally, yes, but as a strong voice for peace within the EU and to take a strong stance, as we did to end South Africa's brutal apartheid regime? We can do more domestically, as well as doing more at international level, to press our EU partners to look for a permanent ceasefire. We can do more to impose trade sanctions on Israel, to pass the occupied territories Bill and to recognise Palestinian statehood.	spk_177

Today, I want to raise a related matter. After a strong campaign from the Irish Cancer Society and affected women and their families, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, committed to bringing legislative proposals to Cabinet before Christmas to support pregnant women who experience serious illness. At present, women in such a situation must use up their maternity leave to cover treatment. It is really welcome that the Minister agreed to act on this, but we still have had no sight of the proposals, and time is running out before the Christmas recess. I have been contacted this week by women who are affected by the current lack of legislation. We do owe it to them to resolve this issue. Could the Taoiseach provide a timeline for a legislative amendment to ensure that women have their full maternity and sick leave entitlements in such situations? Being mindful that we are up against it on time, will this proposal come before Cabinet in advance of the Christmas break? The Irish Cancer Society, in particular, is very anxious about this.	spk_196

As the former Chairperson of the Committee on Gender Equality, I very much welcome that we will see progress. It is a year since our committee presented a report to Government with a cross-party framing of wording to create a more expansive definition of family beyond the family based on marriage and I very much welcome that similar language is being used in the Government proposal. We also proposed a particular text around the new provision to replace the current sexist language around women and mothers with a gender neutral provision recognising and supporting care, but we had proposed, as the citizens' assembly did, that this would recognise care both in the home and in the wider community. It is fair to express disappointment on my own behalf that the definition of care presented by the Government in its own proposed wording is more restrictive.

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-12-05	dail	33	Renters: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]	dbsect_21	I am glad to support this motion on behalf of the Labour Party. I am happy to see this issue being raised tonight. The housing crisis, as we know, is the civil rights issue of our times here in Ireland. I think there is agreement on that across the House. It was acknowledged by the Minister in his speech that we have a crisis which is challenging for anyone seeking to rent or buy right now due to the chronic housing shortage. We know that the social consequences of failed housing policies from Government are significant for people from all walks of life. In the past, we saw a problematic overreliance on the private rented sector but when there was more supply of housing, it caused less of a crisis for many people. Now that there is such a shortage of houses to buy or indeed to rent, the private rental sector has become completely overwhelmed. I think the Minister acknowledged that. All the while, we see, across different demographics, people being forced to stay on in their childhood bedrooms, including young professionals and workers who would, in previous times, have been expected to be able to, at the very least, afford to rent a place of their own, if not to buy their own place. Now they simply cannot do so. I regularly meet constituents and the parents of constituents who are deeply concerned that they cannot even get into renting and will have to keep staying in their childhood bedrooms. Equally, I meet people who are a little older. Just last week, I spoke to a constituent approaching their fiftieth birthday, who is in long-term rental, with a decent, fair rent, but who is in absolute terror that at some point, they will be served with a notice to quit and will simply not be able to afford anywhere to rent, and have given up on ever being able to buy. This is creating really serious issues for people. Parents who rent tell me that they are trying to contend with the stress of worrying that an eviction notice will uproot them and their children from the local area and the support network with local schools. The fear of being asked to leave itself has such a terrible effect on anxiety for so many, including parents and others. The knock-on consequences societally are immense. Our social welfare and pension systems are predicated on the assumption that those who reach their mid-60s will have achieved mortgage-free home ownership. That is really the bedrock of our social protection and pension systems. We are all aware of that. That presumption simply no longer holds water. I have met people in my own constituency who are approaching their 60s and facing the prospect of homelessness because they are still renting and are simply concerned about not being able to continue to afford to do so once they retire. This is a really serious issue. There are pensioners who pay taxes and have contributed to the economy their whole lives on the basis that they will be supported in older age, but they cannot find anywhere to live if they face eviction. This is a really heartbreaking and shameful prospect. There have been a number of different Opposition attempts to put forward constructive policies and proposals to Government on housing and rental. In Labour, we have consistently used our own Private Members' time to try to provide different pathways to addressing the crisis of housing. Most recently, in the Seanad, Labour Senators tabled a motion on tackling vacancy and dereliction to deliver homes to a greater extent. We tabled a Bill to implement the Kenny report to control the price of building on land. We tabled a Dáil motion calling on Government to use the winter eviction ban last year to ease the immense pressures on families in the private rental sector. Two years ago, we tabled a Bill to bring Irish renters' rights legislation into line with most other European countries and to provide greater security of tenure, in particular. The Minister will also know that I wrote to him and to the chairperson of the housing committee, seeking time to debate our homeless families Bill, tabled by Labour to ensure that children would be prioritised in emergency accommodation settings. Our hope is that at some point, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and the Government will be prompted by all of these initiatives from us and other Opposition parties to realise that there is time to change and to engage constructively on these issues. The topic of renters' rights in particular is one on which we should see much more concerted action from Government. This is an issue that concerns so many people. It is not a niche issue. I think all of us have rented at some point. In my own constituency, Dublin Bay South, almost half of households are in the private rental sector. It is the constituency with the highest proportion of private rental households in the country. The CSO tells us that more than 500,000 households rent. It is baffling that the Government has been so slow to tackle reform of this very challenged sector. We see such a sizeable proportion of the population affected and yet, just last week, the Residential Tenancies Board reported the single highest annual hike in new rents since its records began in 2007. It is extraordinary at a time when most of the country is in a rent pressure zone. We are seeing egregious breaching of the rent pressure zone rules through this massive hike in rents nationally. Looking at Dublin, renters are facing a 5.5% increase in rents, well above the purported 2% cap.What are renters to do in this situation? Our current laws and frameworks require that the onus is on renters to seek to enforce rules. We need a much stronger public policy response because in a market of such chronic shortage, where renters are simply afraid to raise their heads above the parapet for fear of angering a landlord, it is simply not good enough. What we are seeing, therefore, is a system where the few rules to protect renters that are in place are routinely flouted. Instead of seeking to address this, the Government has provided one-off giveaways amounting to less than a month's rent, or providing tax breaks to landlords in the budget, and these measures are simply not dealing with the issue. We know more than 15,000 eviction notices were issued in the first nine months of 2023 and the RTB report demonstrates the immense pressure that all of those served with such notices will be under financially when they look to find a new home. Again, I speak about the stress and anxiety involved in this too. Therefore, the so-called no-fault eviction process needs to be addressed. We said, back in March, that lifting the temporary no-fault eviction ban was a catastrophic calculation. No effective contingency plans were in place. I am looking at the Government's countermotion and some of the measures are referenced as effective contingency plans. This is far from the truth. At the moment, I am dealing with one family who have been given a notice to quit and are seeking to operate the Government's own cost-rental tenant  We must provide greater protections for renters. We must ensure that effective rules are introduced, which are also enforced and effective, to address security of tenure, which is the critical issue for so many renters, regulation of rents. The reality is that renting is simply not working for people currently but many are unable to afford or have the option of buying and many are unable to find anywhere affordable to rent. That is why we are seeing so many in emergency homelessness. Others have spoken of the figures but they are extraordinarily shameful. Some 13,000 people are in homelessness and emergency accommodation. Renters are up against it on all fronts. It seems the Government is not prioritising protections for renters, yet they are a critical mass of people. Each individual renter deserves the sort of protections that are taken for granted in any other European country. Many of us will have family and friends who are renting in other European countries; I know I do. They are appalled at the lack of protections for renters here. It is regarded as so normal and so usual to have a security of tenure and to have a right to rent a home you can furnish and make into a home yourself. What we do not have in this country is that sort of protection. We have for far too long seen rental properties as investment opportunities and that has been the focus. We need to start seeing rental properties as homes.	spk_417

We are thinking of all those who are affected. Yesterday evening, an important Labour Party Bill passed Final Stage in the Seanad. Our reproductive leave Bill will provide paid time off work for women who lose a pregnancy early in the term, and for employees who access reproductive healthcare such as IVF. Earlier this week, we were all briefed by the pregnancy loss research group, which has conducted an extensive survey of workers' experiences of pregnancy loss. This study was commissioned by the Department of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and provides useful data to inform next steps. It is instructive to know that this group received over 900 responses to its request for people to respond to the survey. This is a huge number. So many people, women in particular, have experienced such distress as a result of pregnancy loss early in term, and yet there is no statutory entitlement to paid leave in such circumstances. Will the Tánaiste allow the Bill that has now passed through the Seanad as a Labour Party initiative to pass through the Dáil in Government time? We are happy to work with the Tánaiste and his colleagues on bringing it forward.	spk_227
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-11-30	dail	33	Planning and Development Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_45	I welcome the opportunity to debate this important and long-anticipated Bill in the Chamber. We are all very conscious that the planning process has a key impact on addressing the two most major crises faced by our country today, namely the housing disaster and the climate emergency. We know we need robust and effective planning laws in order to deliver the urgently needed increased supply of housing and the necessary infrastructure to enable us to develop our renewable energy sources and meet our climate targets. We are all very conscious of that as we debate the Bill. We are very conscious that the current system is simply not working effectively to deliver on housing or climate infrastructure. We need a robust response. I have engaged with our local representatives and councillors around the country. They tell me Ireland deserves a best-in-class planning system. We are all in agreement on that, but we need a system that can ensure the rapid scaling-up of the building of homes and installation of essential public infrastructure, especially renewable energy infrastructure. Regrettably, there are flaws in the Bill as currently drafted. We will seek to amend it. I hope there will be sufficient time and opportunity for us to engage in that constructive process. I do not think I received a letter from the Minister on this, but I am happy to engage with him on the Bill. We are all conscious that this is a massive Bill. The Minister said it is the third largest Bill in the history of the State. I tried to think what the first two were.	spk_395
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-11-30	dail	33	Planning and Development Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_45	A good deal of the Bill, as we know, restates existing provisions in previous Acts. While I was preparing for the debate on the Bill, I was reminded of a debate on one of its predecessors in 2010 when I was a Senator, namely what became the Planning and Development Act 2010, introduced by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party in government. It was found to have serious issues. However, despite having evident defects it was rushed through both Houses. I recall my frustration at the time when I sat in the Seanad Chamber on the last sitting day before the recess, wading through endless amendments, none of which we had sufficient time to scrutinise as thoroughly as we would have liked. As we approach the Christmas recess with this Bill, I very much hope we will not see that exercise repeated. Significant improvements to the Bill will be needed. I want to identify some of the areas we have examined, albeit that we have had a relatively limited time to peruse the 715 pages in the Bill. At its core, what we have been presented with, despite undoubted levels of engagement from planners, public representatives and civil society, is still clearly a developer-led Bill which is incapable of carrying out the kind of drastic overhaul of the planning system that is needed. For starters, where is the use-it-or-lose-it clause that we understood would be in it? Where is the clause that would demand that developers act to activate planning permission where granted and consequences where they did not do so? I have previously called for a reduction in the time periods for which planning would remain live from the current five years to three. We understood there would be a provision in the Bill to address that concern about land hoarding. Apparently, however, the provision has been left out of the Bill. That would be a big win for developers but a loss to the public. It is a case of the tail wagging the dog at a time when we need strong State-led action to address what is the civil rights issue of this generation, namely the supply of homes and the fact people cannot access housing. Today we heard from the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, about shocking increases in rents despite the fact that most of the country is under rent pressure zones. The current system is simply not working and we know that crucial to addressing this is ensuring a supply of more houses and the building of more homes. It is not just about reforming planning in order to make the planning process more efficient; it is also about ensuring that we have the activation of existing planning permissions. It is well known that there are shocking levels of dormant or non-activated planning permissions for homes. At the end of last year, there were more than 100,000 such applications in the State, more than 50,000 of which relate to Dublin where we know the housing crisis is severe. I speak as a representative of a constituency where nearly half of the properties are rented in the private market. Large numbers of people, including families, are renting privately, many of whom are in fear of losing their homes because of the lack of protections for renters. They are deeply fearful of notices to quit at this time because they cannot even find somewhere to live, never mind whether it is affordable. A sizeable proportion of the people I represent, including renters and those who seek to buy, would much rather have the security of owning their own home but simply cannot access an affordable home anywhere in the area. In that context, it is utterly unforgivable to see speculators and developers hoarding good land and sitting on sites where planning permission has been granted for homes that could be built for the people who so badly need them. We will seek to introduce measures to ensure the use-it-or-lose-it provision is built into the Bill. We want measures to give effect to the Kenny report, which is now decades old but remains important in terms of addressing the chronic issue of land hoarding. We need to make it an imperative that people act on the planning permissions that are granted. That is crucial and should be a primary objective in the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government and a primary focus of the Bill. There is a discussion to be had as to how much of the 715 pages of the Bill will actually make meaningful changes and how much is simply, as I said, restating existing laws and falling short of what is needed. As the Minister said in his speech, further legislation will come and he spoke about some amendments he will bring forward. The reforms recently recommended by the Law Reform Commission will apparently now take effect through different legislation. The Minister might confirm when it is proposed to bring that forward. I do not think he has given us a timeline. It would be helpful to try to get a picture as to when an entirely new and robust planning system will be in place. One aspect of the Bill is the establishment of a new planning commission. It will be established from the ashes of An Bord Pleanála, but with an enormous backlog of work already on its hands. We need to know that there will be more here than just a change of name. We need to know that the change will be more substantial. An Bord Pleanála, as we all know, has been in the news for all the wrong reasons over recent months. The actions of a small number of individuals should not have driven a headline change in a name. If it is just an exercise in rebranding, that is simply not good enough. In October, it was reported that the backlog in An Bord Pleanála in deciding appeals has now grown to some 3,600 cases, roughly a whole year's intake. Serious efforts are under way to get through that backlog and many of us have met An Bord Pleanála to discuss this issue. The major critical issue currently facing the board as currently constituted is not the legislation, the legislative process, judicial reviews or NIMBYs; rather, it is a shortage of planners and staff. The Minister acknowledged that in his speech when he referred to hiring more staff. It is, of course, welcome to hear that staff numbers will be increased, but the question remains as to whether that will be enough to address the backlog and deliver on the increased supply that we all know is needed. I have spoken many times in the House about the shortfall in Government housing targets. When I addressed the Taoiseach on this recently, he acknowledged that there would be a review of the targets and that the figure of 30,000 homes per year is now seen as too low to deal with increased demographic demand. We all know the real need is more like 50,000 to 60,000 new builds a year. We will need not just a change of name and new legislation but, crucially, more planners and staff, as well as people working in construction and whatever new planning system emerges as a result of the Bill and other legislation. The new commission, as envisaged in the Bill, will inherit existing staff. The Minister has said there will be an increase, but will that be enough to take on new roles, deal with the new challenges and deliver the vastly increased supply that we all know is needed? Anyone who speaks across planning and construction raises with us the shortage of planners as a major concern, as well as the shortage of staff generally. We know it is exacerbating the housing crisis and adversely impacting on the demand for development more widely. It also undermines the function, role and public perception of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and local authorities.To put it bluntly, people simply do not believe the capacity is there throughout the State, at both local and national level, to deliver the increased levels of housing that are needed. This needs to be addressed, but nothing in the Bill indicates that the historical under-resourcing and understaffing of our planning system is being addressed. If we are putting in new statutory obligations and timeframes, that is welcome, but if we do that without investing the necessary resources, we will undermine credibility in the new system and people's belief in its capacity to deliver on the changes. Given the current backlogs caused, as we know, by the lack of staff and personnel, the intended legislation seems to miss that factor and perhaps ignore it. There is a need for a more holistic view on funding for third level courses and apprenticeships. The Minister stated in his contribution that work is going to be done on this, but it needs to be done rapidly and it should have been happening before now. There needs to be engagement with the Minister for further and higher education and we need to hear what measures are being taken, such as through the critical skills list, to ensure we have the levels of recruitment we are going to need. This is needed not just to ensure we will meet the demand for housing that we all know exists so patently and painfully throughout the country; it is necessary also for us to build the climate infrastructure that both the Minister and I have spoken about. We cannot meet our 2030 climate change targets, just six and a bit years away now, without making the necessary investment. I have engaged extensively with those working in wind power and solar power and they all tell me planning is the major obstacle to the development of the infrastructure they are keen to develop. There are now many national and international bodies, companies and firms with new technologies and reduced costs for developing solar and offshore wind at scale, with exciting potential, but the planning system has created a real obstacle to progress. In the week of COP28, this should be uppermost in our minds. We need a planning system that is robust enough not just to deliver the increased levels of housing that are needed but also to deliver efficient and effective infrastructure for renewable energy capacity. Again, it is about funding, resources and personnel and not just about law reform. Looking at some of the measures where the Bill will repeal and replace existing provisions, there are concerns it may detract from democratic accountability, a concern raised with many of us by many individuals and organisations. For example, when the national planning framework was introduced in 2018, section 18 of that year's Act required the Government to submit any draft of a revised or new framework for the approval of each House of the Oireachtas before it was published. That requirement, admittedly, did not extend to the then current national spatial strategy, which was simply renamed as the national planning framework and was continued in force without approval by either House. Now, however, this new Bill proposes to dispense with Oireachtas approval altogether, and will continue the current unapproved framework that is in force and enable the Government to make new or revised frameworks without the requirement for the approval of the two Houses. I would be interested to hear the Minister’s response on this because it raises not just issues relating to democratic participation and accountability but also constitutional issues relating to what is effectively law-making without the participation of the Oireachtas. That, again, is a real concern. This power, it seems, will be supplemented by a ministerial power to issue national planning statements detailing a Minister's instructions on anything and everything, from the contents of a regional, spatial and economic strategy to the layout of amenity spaces. The Bill will specifically enable the Minister to repeat instructions given by a predecessor regarding the promotion of a particular type of development - we might all think of the collapsed and somewhat hare-brained effort to shift Dubliners into tiny, costly so-called co-living spaces - but with this Bill there will be no requirement for Dáil and Seanad approval for the making of what will, in effect, be legislation of that sort. That is a concern, and we will seek to amend the Bill to require that these powers not be exercised without the prior consent of both Houses, because we are concerned the legislation will represent a massive centralisation of control in the hands of Ministers without adequate safeguards and oversight over power and its impacts. Another example of what might be described as a power grab is the change in approach to how the Government, Ministers, the planning regulator, An Bord Pleanála and local authorities can be held to account for the lawfulness of their decisions. I am speaking, obviously, about the judicial review measures. Representatives of environmental NGOs, such as Attracta Uí Bhroin of the Irish Environmental Network, have described the proposal as an unprecedented regression in access to justice rights and the ability to hold authorities to account before the courts. The Minister has spoken about the Bill as streamlining judicial review but these are valid concerns. While there are, certainly, some who could be described as serial objectors, their interventions have had a minimal impact on the efficiency of the overall planning process and they are often used as scapegoats in this regard. The data say, for example, that just 0.25% of the overall planning decisions in 2021 were subject to judicial review, so I think we tend to overstate this issue. During pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, countless stakeholders warned of the dangers of making changes in this area and the risk of delays with what is often referred to as satellite litigation, where several lawsuits relating to major proceedings take place in another court. We see that with arguments on preliminary issues such as scope and  We are concerned that, as drafted, Part 9, on changes to judicial review, may create significant obstacles for ordinary groups and associations that come together informally to address issues in their community. I refer specifically to the proposed environmental legal costs financial assistance mechanism - there must be a snappier title – in Chapter 2 of Part 9 and the concerns that unduly centralised control will be exercised by the Government through this mechanism and that it will not increase access to justice, as the Minister suggested, but rather may act as an impediment to those with valid legal issues. I have a sense of  Public and environmental NGOs are concerned about being put at a material disadvantage in trying to address or ameliorate unsustainable development. Developers will not be constrained by the cost rules and will enjoy the benefit of there being no order as to costs if they lose a case. This is a significant concern, not least at a time when the climate and biodiversity crises should be at the top of our agenda. It seems that in recognition that there may be some who seek to exploit the system, there is a danger that we strike the wrong balance when it comes to ensuring rights of access to justice for the many and for the ultimate good that comes from diligence, oversight and good planning. We need to ensure planning is good and sustainable and we need to legislate in a proportionate and informed way to address this issue. Another issue was brought to my attention by Fórsa, the trade union, which represents employees of An Bord Pleanála. I am told that despite the proposed legislation, including, as we all know, significant changes to the organisational structure of the board, to date there has been very little, if any, engagement with Fórsa on the proposed changes, yet the Bill will have a substantial impact on the duties and responsibilities carried out by its members. There is a concern about the lack of consultation on significant changes affecting members. I would be grateful if the Minister could address that point in his response. How will he engage with the concerns of staff? Planning and development legislation is profoundly important, even in the case of Bills that are less weighty in size. This legislation, and the infrastructure it will create, will shape the physical world around us. It will decide whether our State is up to the task of providing for its people and, in particular, decide whether we can deliver on the much-needed increased provision of housing for our people and the increased and more effective provision of climate and renewable energy infrastructure. I very much hope, therefore, that this will not be a wasted opportunity, that we will have an opportunity for constructive engagement to ensure the concerns we and others have for the Bill will be addressed, and that improved and revised legislation will finally pass to ensure we will have a fit-for-purpose planning system.	spk_397

We know the problem. There are simply not enough gardaí, including visible gardaí, and not enough support for front-line gardaí, who are, it seems, forced to communicate by WhatsApp. There has been a hands-off approach to policing the far right for far too long.

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-11-29	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_11	However, I also believe we have seen grandstanding by those in government, by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael members who are desperately seeking to evade accountability by churning out calls that will do anything but address the real crisis facing policing. We have heard red herring calls, such as calls for cuts to benefits and for facial recognition technology, water cannons, dogs and more police powers. We warned yesterday that the Minister cannot legislate her way out of this crisis – it is not about that – nor can she distract us with political theatre, such as asking the Policing Authority to provide clarity on the use of force. That is a farcical question because we know the Garda Commissioner and senior management are responsible for providing the training and guidance to gardaí on the proportionate use of force. The Policing Authority is not a legal adviser. Who has made this request and why? Was it the Commissioner who asked for clarity on the use of force, or is it merely a distraction tactic of the Minister? What people really want now is reassurance that our streets will be safe and attacks and riots will not happen again. We need accountability and more visible policing, not grandstanding from the Opposition or Government. The Garda Commissioner is in charge of policing operations in the State and the Minister is politically responsible for policing. Last year, the whole Government, on the Minister's advice, extended the Commissioner's term of appointment to 2025. Under the Government members' combined watch, Garda numbers in Dublin have fallen. There are 200 gardaí fewer now on the streets than in 2020. Law and order are being eroded across the capital city's streets and our country. There is a triple crisis within the Garda of morale, recruitment and retention, and I spoke about it yesterday. An overwhelming majority of rank-and-file gardaí have no confidence in their leadership, and more and more gardaí are simply leaving the force. A record 114 gardaí resigned up to the end of September and there were 851 voluntary retirements in the past three years, implying a force that is being hollowed out. The Minister needs to address morale issues and make training more attractive. Our communities need more gardaí on the streets, with a functioning leadership and real political accountability. Will the Minister tell us whether Commissioner Harris asked for clarity on the use of force or was it her idea? What are she and the Commissioner doing to stop gardaí from resigning? At any point since Thursday, has the Commissioner offered to resign after what was a complete breakdown of law and order on the streets of Dublin?	spk_83

Certainly, this issue did not start around last Thursday afternoon. We know about these issues in the Garda concerning morale, recruitment and retention that have been building for so long. There was a lack of gardaí on the ground, not just last Thursday night but also for some time before that. Gardaí had to rely on WhatsApp to call on colleagues to come into town last Thursday. We have seen issues such as policing in Dublin being run on overtime for some time and policing nationwide being run on a shoestring by gardaí who feel they do not have the legitimate and requisite supports. It is not good enough. I asked the Minister whether the Commissioner had offered to resign, and I ask her again. We believe there must be accountability and adequate support for gardaí. When the barricades come down around Leinster House and the temporary measures in place for December have ended, what will be done to ensure adequate supports for gardaí? What measures will the Minister and Commissioner take on this? Are they going to increase the training pay for gardaí? It is simply unacceptable that trainees do not get the full starting salary. We call on the Minister to encourage more gardaí to join the force and provide the necessary support and the necessary reassurance to the public to ensure this issue will not arise again. What is the Minister doing to reassure us that our streets can be safe, not just in Dublin but also across the country?	spk_85

It is again seeking to require An Coimisiún Toghcháin to conduct research on two specific issues. First, on the abolition of constituencies returning three members. Secondly, a specification for an indeterminate period, that is indefinitely, with regard to the fixed number of members for the Dail and a fixed set of boundaries for constituencies. We are asking An Coimisiún Toghcháin to conduct research into this. Again, I stress, this is an attempt to be constructive and to ensure future-proofing. I believe we are all agreed that the most recent exercise by the Electoral Commission will have to be repeated after the next census results are published. The report of the Electoral Commission made clear that the exclusion of provision for six-seat constituencies and the continued use of three-seaters set the parameters for its deliberations. I know that the Minister of State's own party and my own expressly wanted to see provision made for six-seat constituencies. It is not just that we believe that they might be more favourable to smaller parties, as indeed they are, but much more importantly, they are more reflective of people voting intentions. There is an excellent article by Professor Michael Gallagher on 6 September in  The advantage for people and for voters would be that they would not see themselves moving between constituencies and we would not see county boundaries being breached, as we have done in every constituency with every report from electoral commissions over the years. This would be a way of future-proofing and of ensuring greater certainty and stability for people who are voting. I spoke before about my loss of Kimmage C Ward in Dublin Bay South. This was not my loss but it was the loss of that ward to the Dublin Bay South constituency for the next election. That ward has moved in and out of Dublin South Central and what was Dublin South-East, and is now Dublin Bay South, over many years. We all know different examples. We have all seen this with Wexford and Cork where constituency boundaries have been drawn and redrawn. People then no longer have certainty over the electoral area in which they live and over the make-up of the of the political representation they will have. We believe, and indeed Professor Gallagher makes the point very persuasively, that it would be more representative and would be a better way to support our democratic system to have that model in place and, indeed, to allow for six-seater constituencies, so in the proportional representation single transferable vote, PRSTV, system people's voting preferences would be more closely acknowledged and recognised in the Dáil. I am not going to press this to a full vote but I want to press it to a voice vote because we believe it is a very important principle. There was also an amendment we had put down which was ruled out of order which I know that I raised earlier with the Minister of State about ruling out the publication of postal addresses of candidates in elections, local and national, and I say again that that is an important area. The Labour Party will certainly be putting all of these matters into the submission we will be making to the Electoral Commission in the context of the research programme it is devising and we are very hopeful, even if the amendments are not passed, that we will see the Electoral Commission making recommendations. We believe these are all vitally important issues for the governance of future elections."	spk_231

Uppermost in all our thoughts and minds today are those who were so brutally attacked on Parnell Square last Thursday - the little girl and the care worker still in hospital; the other children injured and traumatised in the attack; their families, friends, classmates and communities. We think of all of them and send them our very best wishes. We commend those whose courageous interventions prevented even more devastation on Thursday. We also send our thoughts and solidarity to those gardaí and first responders, transport and council workers and others who were terrorised while doing their jobs or peacefully going about their business in Dublin on Thursday, and those who had to clean up after the wanton destruction that resulted from the awful riots we saw that evening. I condemn outright the outrageous violence we saw unfold on our streets, the streets of our capital city. Nobody here has a monopoly on the distress we all feel in the aftermath of last Thursday but there must be accountability for what occurred. Those shocking events have brought home to us all the true extent of the crisis in policing, particularly policing in Dublin, that has developed under the watch of this Government. On Friday, the Commissioner Harris asserted that nobody could have anticipated the riots, but that is simply not credible. Long before last week, we saw despicable events orchestrated by the far right across the country, including anti-migrant protests, anti-LGBT protests outside libraries and people burnt out of tents on Mount Street. Everyone in this House is aware of the hate and disinformation that is being spread, especially about immigration. I am sorry to say there are high-profile individuals in this country and people in this House and in the Seanad who have used language about immigration that has undoubtedly contributed to the spread of that disinformation.	spk_9

There is no one in this country who did not anticipate that the far right might seek to orchestrate unrest in our capital. On Thursday, what we saw was a perfect storm, a complete collapse of order on our streets through a combination of failures, namely, failure to tackle the far right and failure to address the triple crisis of morale, recruitment and retention within the Garda. There were failures at operational level, for which the Commissioner and senior gardaí are responsible. There were failures at political and government level for which the Minister for Justice and all in this Government are responsible. We in the Labour Party have no confidence in this Government's handling of policing. Week in, week out, our representatives have been raising the triple crisis facing the Garda on morale, recruitment and retention. We know what is needed, and that is a stronger response against the far right and, crucially, more gardaí. We need more community gardaí and more gardaí on our streets. We should be reaching for more people and more personnel in the Garda Síochána. That is what the Garda is seeking too - front-line gardaí.It seems the best Fine Gael can offer is more powers. The Taoiseach cannot legislate his way out of this. How will the Government address whole-of-government failures on policing? Will it move to initiate an independent review into the failures which allowed a small group of people last week to destroy property, injure our police and terrorise our community? We must see accountability and know why those failures occurred.	spk_11

We need to see three actions in particular. First is conducting an independent and urgent review into what went wrong in order that we can see proper accountability. A Policing Authority review is not enough. We need to see the inspectorate going in. We need an independent review of what went wrong. We also need to see a real commitment from Government to tackling and targeting the far right and ensuring intelligence-led policing is taking it on. Third, we need a commitment from Government to give front-line gardaí the resources they need, ensure we have more personnel and not allow the numbers to drop – as they have – below 4,000. We need that commitment urgently from Government. The key issue will be accountability. We saw over the weekend some political grandstanding on this issue and calls not just from Opposition but, it seems now, members of the Taoiseach’s partners in government, a Fianna Fáil Senator most recently, for heads to roll. That is grandstanding and playacting at a time when people in this country and city are calling out for political leadership and unity of purpose against the awful threat of the far right. We need to see unity of purpose and we are not even seeing it from Government. We see Fianna Fáil speaking with one voice in the media, yet rowing in on the Government benches behind the Minister and the Government.There is a whole-of-government failure here.

Due to the horror of the attack and subsequent riot in Dublin on Thursday, undoubtedly the homelessness figures were pushed down the political agenda, but I also want to raise the matter because it was a very sad milestone for our country to see over 13,000 people now recorded as homeless, nearly 4,000 of whom are children. I too ask what the Government is doing about it because there is a sense from the Government of almost a helplessness and a lack of control. Just as policing was out of control on Thursday night, it seems there is no sense that the Government has homelessness under control.If the Government is not proposing to reintroduce the temporary no-fault eviction ban this winter, what does it propose to do to help those who are now in homelessness, those families in emergency accommodation as we speak, and to help the rough sleepers on the streets of our capital city and other cities around the country?

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-11-23	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_29	The prospect of a temporary end to Israel’s brutal bombardment of Gaza and the expected and hoped-for release by Hamas of women and children hostages including, we hope, Emily Hand, offers a glimmer of hope in what are very dark days. However, we all appreciate that work must continue and diplomatic efforts internationally must intensify until a permanent ceasefire can be agreed. We have heard from the Israeli Government that it has two stated aims, namely, the release of all hostages and the elimination of Hamas. While hope remains that a pause will last until we see hostages released, we know that tragically Netanyahu’s approach to that second stated goal has involved the merciless killing of so many children, women, men, doctors, UN staff, journalists and others. We must not be naive about the enormous challenge of protecting what remains of Gaza and preventing what looks hideously increasingly likely to be the genocide of its civilians. For our part, I think we can all agree that Ireland has the benefit of our diplomatic reputation and the respect of countries internationally. That position morally obliges us to act to challenge in the strongest possible terms the horror that has been unleashed by the Israeli Government and to seek to end the bombardment of the people of Gaza. We have heard workers from the United Nations and Médecins Sans Frontières saying that this is the worst situation they have witnessed in their careers. Gaza is now the most dangerous place in the world for a child and the average age of a person killed in the conflict is just five years old. It is heart-breaking to think of those five-year-olds. We need to act. We need to deploy tactics, such as those that were used against South Africa during apartheid, to put an end to the brutality of the Israeli regime. We need to act to impose strong sanctions on Israel and end trade with the occupied territories. While we may be militarily neutral, we are not politically neutral in the face of the brutal bombardment of Gaza. We have yet to use all the diplomatic tools that are available to us in the Gaza context. That makes even more frustrating yesterday’s surprise announcement by the Tánaiste about the triple lock, which does have a link with our neutrality. We cannot separate the two. Despite the Tánaiste’s denials when the Consultative Forum on International Security Policy was formed, it is clear that his announcement in the wake of that represents a creeping drift in the Government away from our longstanding policy of military neutrality. In the Dáil, the Tánaiste effectively asserted last night, and indeed again today, that the triple lock leaves us at the whim of five countries and in particular at the whim of Russia on the UN Security Council. I share the Tánaiste’s views on Russia. I absolutely share them. I have no time for the Russian regime. Yet, it is the answer to the wrong question to say that we should move away from the triple lock because there is a problem with Russia’s veto on the UN Security Council. The question we should be asking is the question of reform of the Security Council to remove that veto and move away from the power the UN Security Council has. The reality is that our triple lock in the Defence Act provides that we may participate in international peace-keeping forces that are mandated by the UN General Assembly, as well as the UN Security Council. We need to see the power of the UN General Assembly being asserted and brought to the fore in the United Nations. If I may, I think the Tánaiste is putting the cart before the horse in seeking to change a longstanding policy that is represented and protected by the triple lock. We are asking him to abandon plans to end the triple lock and instead to enshrine Ireland’s neutrality in the Constitution.	spk_250

He is right to commend the UN aid workers and the UN role in Gaza. But it is undermining of the UN to suggest that because of flaws in the UN that we should somehow abandon our triple lock. That was not the recommendation that was made by Professor Richardson or her forum. She acknowledged the matter was contested and her report had other recommendations that are vitally important, including more spending on the Defence Forces.Senator Wall raised this in the Seanad yesterday, calling for urgency in implementing recommendations of the Commission on the Defence Forces such as access to the working time directive. Deputy Howlin reminded us that in the budget the increasing defence spending has soared to the dizzying heights of just 1% of GDP. We need to do much more to support our personnel in the Defence Forces and ensure they are well-equipped to engage in UN-mandated peacekeeping missions. It is entirely ill-conceived to start talking about dismantling or undermining the triple lock or undermining and critiquing the role of the United Nations, which, however flawed, is a global forum and agency for peace that was established after the carnage of the Second World War. We have a proud role and history in Ireland with the United Nations.

It is a national disgrace that we have such a scourge of vacancy and dereliction across the country when nearly 13,000 people are homeless. I raised the issue with the Taoiseach yesterday. I pointed out the enormous shortfall between the number of properties recorded as vacant in the census and the paltry figure of 3,000 homes that will be subject to the new vacant homes tax. The Taoiseach came back and criticised me, and said that those who mention census figures for vacancy and dereliction were wrong and the figures were not accurate. I raised the disparity simply to illustrate the issue that the Government is not aware of the scale of the problem. We do not know how many properties across the country are vacant or derelict. We know that Revenue says there are 57,000 such properties, according to local property tax figures. We know that nearly 50,000 homes stayed empty between the two previous censuses. We certainly know there are many, many more than 3,000 vacant homes lying idle and which could be used for those who so desperately need homes. I ask the Government to commit to establishing a national register on vacancy and dereliction to ensure we have some idea of the scale of the issue and then consider how we can address it as a matter of urgency.	spk_321

On 28 September, I raised with the Tánaiste the scourge of vacancy and dereliction across cities, towns and villages. On that date, he told me my question would be better directed to local councils. It seemed it was not a priority for national government. The following week, news broke that the HSE is hoarding hundreds of empty properties across the country. Subsequent replies to parliamentary questions I tabled confirmed that other public bodies, such as Irish Rail and the OPW, are engaged in the same practice and sitting on empty premises. When I raised the issue again, it seemed the penny had finally dropped. Now the Taoiseach is saying there is a carrot-and-stick approach, but it is clear there is not enough of either the carrot or the stick when a mere 3,000 properties will be subject to the new vacant home tax, the Government's so-called silver bullet. If we take census estimates, that amounts to fewer than 2% of all empty properties throughout the country at a time when 13,000 people are homeless. Can the Taoiseach assure the House he will take more effective carrot-and-stick measures to ensure the scourge of vacancy and dereliction is tackled and people can see those idle homes turned into proper family homes for them?	spk_150

In particular, we are concerned to see that, rather than offering a meaningful recognition of carers, it is reported that the draft will merely ""strive to support the provision of care"", which is a rather ineffective phrase. Furthermore, we understand from the reports in the newspapers that the provision of care to be recognised in the Constitution will be limited to that provided within the home or family, whereas the committee and the citizens' assembly proposed a more inclusive definition of care to include care outside the home. Crucially, in light of the Johnny O'Meara case, we also want to ensure the referendum will expand the definition of ""family"" beyond that based on marriage. I would welcome clarity on that."	spk_51

Certainly, it has been a long road. I was just calculating that it was 34 years ago that I and a group of other students were threatened with prison for giving information on abortion to women in crisis pregnancies. We have come a long way since then but I certainly never thought at the time that it would take so long. Five years on from 2018, there has been a long delay in putting in place the necessary safe access zones. Other Deputies have spoken about the need for them but, clearly, anyone who speaks to a doctor, a medical receptionist or a practice nurse involved in the delivery of the service of abortion will be aware of the sort of intimidation going on under the radar and at a low level. I spoke at the inaugural conference of abortion providers in Dublin earlier this year and heard from GPs, hospital doctors and other medical staff about the sort of intimidation receptionists are under, especially in small practices where GPs are known to be providers and where there is a high level of conscientious objection and, therefore, individual providers can be targeted. Even just a stone's throw from here, outside Holles Street hospital, we are seeing ongoing protests, so we are all aware of the context and the need for this legislation. It will have an important effect on deterring protesters and, therefore, on encouraging more doctors to provide where they see there is an effective action they can take against protests and intimidation. That is why it is so important we ensure the legislation is going to be effective. The two amendments are designed to ensure it will be effective, that the warning system provided for will be robust and that there will, crucially, be a future-proofed recording method that will be more facilitative and less prescriptive. Currently, as we know, section 4(2) is very clear in stating that Garda members shall record instances in writing, and what the amendments seek to do is simply to provide a little more flexibility around that. Finally, on the points made about whether it is the remit of the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Health, I think that, in the case of all the amending health legislation we brought forward during Covid, the Minister for Health was the designated Minister to issue directions, even on the penal provisions. That is a technical point but an important one.	spk_241

It is so important we ensure this legislation is passed because, as I have said, its purpose is to ensure women will have safe access to healthcare services that women and girls so badly need in this country. It will also have the effect I spoke about earlier in deterring those who would seek to obstruct women's access to legal healthcare. It will have an encouraging and incentivising effect to ensure more doctors, healthcare providers and hospitals will feel empowered to offer this important service and join those who are already doing so but who, in many cases, may feel isolated in particular areas and who are facing intimidation. The Minister is aware, as we all are, that it will only be in a very small number of cases that we would ever expect to see the full power of the legislation used against those who persist in intimidating and obstructing women's access. This is not legislation that restricts the right to protest. It is really important that those who portray it as such go back and read what is in the Bill, in particular section 2, which clearly sets out a very high bar for any sort of Garda or policing intervention. I will speak in a moment about that. The Labour Party amendment is an amendment to the Minister's amendment No. 4. I refer also to Deputy Shortall's amendment No. 2 and amendment No. 5 from Deputy Cullinane. All of the amendments in this group of amendments are seeking to do the same thing, that is, to ensure a review will be carried out in a relatively short and prescribed time and that it will not be open-ended. We say it should be 12 months and Deputy Cullinane says the process should be concluded within 24 months but we are all trying to do the same thing, namely, to ensure this is a time-limited review exercise. The reason is that we have waited five years for this legislation. We all know what we want to see it do and it will be apparent within a few months if it is having the desired effect of deterring protests, ensuring safe access for women and encouraging more medics to sign up. Those are the purposes this legislation seeks to serve and which we all want it to serve. As I said, this is not about numbers of prosecutions, nor should it be, because there should not need to be many prosecutions. That high bar is there for a reason. In section 2, it is clearly provided that this is not a general prohibition on protest. It will not stop anyone from marching down O'Connell Street, or indeed Kildare Street, to express their view about abortion. Rather, it seeks to provide limits and restrictions on particular types of conduct and only where that conduct takes place within 100 m of a healthcare provider. The safe access zone location is very prescribed, as is the type of conduct. There are four types of conduct prescribed, namely, conduct which is likely to obstruct or impede people from accessing healthcare; conduct that is communication of material in a particular manner; conduct that is likely to threaten or intimidate; and the photographing, filming or recording by people. There is, however, a further restriction and this is really the high bar, and I speak as somebody who has defended and worked in the Criminal Courts. There is the high bar of  We need to ensure the legislation is effective. That is why we are all keen to see a time-limited review provision in place. That is why the Labour Party has put forward an amendment to the Minister's amendment, which simply proposes to replace the 18-month clause with a 12-month provision. This would time-limit the review process and ensure we will know in a fairly swift fashion whether the legislation can be said to be effective. There are concerns. Deputy Shortall raised concerns around how the warning system works.The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 has a rather similar provision under section 8, where it is an offence for somebody to fail to comply with a direction to move on by a garda. That is a similar provision. The warning system will certainly have to be tested to see if it works. There may only be a relatively small number of situations where gardaí are issuing warnings and where that second step is carried out. We will see in a few months whether the legislation is effective in the other ways that we hope it will be, that is, to deter protests, to ensure women have safe access and, of course, to encourage more providers to start providing services. The key purpose is to ensure safe access. All of us want to ensure that women have safe access to their reproductive healthcare. We have had a shameful history in this country of restricting women's access to reproductive rights, healthcare and even contraception, until relatively recently. This legislation, far from being restrictive, is facilitative of safe access. That is the best and only appropriate way to view this legislation. It is facilitative and ensures safe access to services without impediment, intimidation and obstruction. For far too long, our rights of access to healthcare have been restricted and impeded. We have been intimidated. I will not speak about my own personal experience over many years. Certainly, I have been subjected to some pretty nasty protest, as many have, seeking to impede my expression of view as a pro-choice activist for many years. It is time that we moved forward. Sometimes, during this debate this evening, it feels like we have stepped back in time, but the people spoke five years ago and they spoke by a two thirds majority to ensure women would have access to reproductive healthcare, and this legislation seeks to facilitate that.	spk_270

I appreciate that the Minister's amendment provides terms similar to the 2018 Act. As others have done, I commend Marie O'Shea and the review process of the operation of the 2018 Act. It was commendable. The safe access zone Bill is very different. It contains a much more confined set of provisions. It is much shorter and it deals with a discrete issue. I note the point that the Minister has chosen 18 months rather than the three years in the 2018 Act. Three years was a much more appropriate time period for an Act that had so many more provisions and set in place an entire new system of very important healthcare. This is very much a facilitative Bill that is looking to provide for safe access rules. It is a much smaller and more confined policy issue. Deputy Shortall's point on the need for a specific review into the effectiveness of the system of recording warnings is a good one. All of us also agreed that the broader review of the operation of the legislation is necessary. We will not oppose the Minister's amendment because it is far more preferable to have a review, even if it is not as time limited as we would like. The idea of having it after 12 months is preferable.	spk_274

They lived in Castleknock in Dublin for many years. We are all thinking of Emily Hand and her family since her horrific abduction by Hamas in the brutal attack on civilians on 7 October. I welcome the Taoiseach's confirmation that the Government has ongoing engagement with Cairo and Tel Aviv. He confirmed that to me last week in the House. I know the Government is seeking the urgent release of all those with connections to Ireland. It is of utmost importance that those efforts continue and we all support that. However, to date those efforts have not been enough. Irish citizens remain trapped in Gaza. We are all utterly despondent at what is happening with the continued holding of hostages by Hamas and Israel's ongoing bombardment. We are also distressed at the spillover of violence into the West Bank and neighbouring countries. That is why it has been so welcome to see the Government calling for an immediate ceasefire. All of us in opposition share this view because in this country we know all too well that talking and a political resolution cannot start until the bullets stop and we have a ceasefire. To date, the exhortations to the Israeli Government to stop the killing and to stop breaching international law appear to have been in vain. It would appear that in the Israeli administration and Netanyahu government there is no willingness to listen, even to intimations from the US administration that Israel has crossed a line for it. Clearly, further action needs to be taken by all of us. We are increasingly seeing other countries severing diplomatic relations with Israel over its heinous breaches of international law and the genocidal actions we are seeing with the carpet bombing of Gaza. South Africa and Bolivia have ended relations with Israel. Many more countries, including Colombia and Chile, have recalled ambassadors and embassy staff. This week, several Opposition motions before the Oireachtas propose using the diplomatic tools available to us, just as Ireland did with apartheid South Africa. It is incumbent on the Government to reflect on how Ireland should proceed and whether the Israeli ambassador's position remains tenable in light of the rising death toll in Gaza and the evidence we are hearing from aid workers and others. Will the Government support an escalation of our diplomatic protest against the actions of the Israeli Government by removing diplomatic status from the ambassador and ensuring breaches of international law by Israel and Hamas are investigated and prosecuted by the International Criminal Court, ICC?	spk_16

While we need to continue all forms of constructive engagement to secure the release of Emily Hand and the 40 Irish citizens who are trapped and effectively being held hostage by the Israeli Government in Gaza, we must also continue to call out and condemn the breaches of international law by Netanyahu’s Government. At the weekend, I was glad to join with other social democratic party leaders at the Party of European Socialists’s annual congress. While there, I made strong representations on the need for a united call from across Europe for an immediate ceasefire. Many of those in attendance emphasised the importance of Ireland’s leadership on this issue, both from the Government and the Opposition, because as a neutral country with a strong record on international peacekeeping missions and with our own history of conflict resolution on this island, we have a responsibility that is not to be taken lightly. It is important that our Government and Ireland show strong leadership in pushing further for Israel to stop its barbaric action in Gaza, put an end to this war on children and the horrific death toll that is rising daily in Gaza, and listen to the calls of aid workers, medics and others for the bullets to stop and a ceasefire to be put in place. I appeal to the Minister to use every lever at the Government’s disposal, including that of diplomatic relations, to ensure that this war on children is ended.	spk_18

Indeed, our thoughts are with all those workers in RTÉ who have learnt that one in five of them, some 400 workers, may see their jobs cut as part of these proposed cuts. I echo the words of the RTÉ trade union group and the National Union of Journalists in saying that the leak and the plans are a breach of trust. When the legacy of the Government is written, will it be the total gutting of RTÉ? That is what we are looking at. It would be appropriate for us to have a debate in this House as to what the future is for RTÉ, the Government's plans, and what it proposes to do to save our national broadcaster to ensure we have a public service broadcaster. It is so important we see that. That debate should also encompass the issue of workers' rights. This is not just for those facing redundancy in RTÉ. Those who remain on bogus self-employment contracts in RTÉ also deserve some clarity on their future.	spk_39

However, it is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to tackling vacancy and dereliction. Unfortunately, the Government has simply not been doing enough to ensure not just that we see more homes provided for people but also a halt to urban decay and to the scourge of vacancy and dereliction across our communities. Tomorrow, the Seanad will debate a motion brought forward by Labour Senators setting out a pathway to transform vacant and derelict sites into homes. There is something the Government can do right away on this. The Government can act much more quickly and effectively to clean up its own house, literally. We learned last month through parliamentary questions that the HSE is sitting on thousands of empty properties. The OPW is also in possession of a portfolio of empty sites. More replies to parliamentary questions confirmed that Irish Rail is sitting on nearly 120 empty cottages across the country. The Government has failed to prevent the hoarding of vacant properties by the State	spk_49

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-11-14	dail	33	Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_10	"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2023. It is standard procedure to introduce a Bill like this to implement the recommendations of the Electoral Commission. We have seen similar legislation in the past on foot of the recommendations of constituency commissions. What marks this out is that it is the first report from the newly established An Coimisiún Toghcháin. It goes without saying that we accept the recommendations of this report, as is the practice, but we believe there are flaws in the process. I was very struck by really a strong analysis of the report's findings and indeed of the process by Professor Michael Gallagher in ...the number of seats per constituency (known by the term ‘district magnitude’) is exceptionally small for a proportional representation (PR) system. With 174 seats and 43 constituencies in the next Dáil, average district magnitude is barely above four, much lower than that of most European countries that employ PR. In Spain, for example, it’s seven, while in Finland it’s more than 15. He argues in keeping with this that three-seat constituencies are simply too small to ensure proportionality. While smaller parties are disadvantaged by this - I know the Minister of State will appreciate that, as do I - the real concern is not about whether the concept of three-seat constituencies is fair to any particular party. The primary concern should be about whether it is fair to voters and whether it ensures the composition of the Dáil reflects the way people voted. I do not mean to criticise the commission on this. Clearly the commission had no option but to abide by the legislation that specified it was confined to proposing constituencies in the three- to five-seat range. I hope that, as Professor Gallagher argues, this will be the last time we hear about three-seaters. We should move away from three-seaters. I see the Minister of State nodding. I know the Green Party had a view on this as did we. In the Labour Party's submission to the commission, we made clear our preference for larger numbers of seats per constituency. A mix of constituencies in the range of four to six, or four to seven, would guarantee a better district magnitude.There is the political science from an objective political scientist of some international renown. Professor Gallagher has also pointed out, as regards flaws in the process, that it is very unusual, comparatively, for the size of parliament to fluctuate constantly. The norm across the world is for the size of parliament to remain fixed over time, yet in Ireland we have become used to having an increase or a decrease in the number of parliamentarians. There is a trope we hear constantly that Ireland has too many TDs  I offer those critiques, drawing on Professor Gallagher's criticism, to point to the constrained statutory criteria that the commission was given by the Government and, we would argue, a somewhat conservative interpretation of those terms of reference. That means we believe there were flaws in the system. By relying on a narrow reading of the statutory terms of reference, the commission, in our view, failed to be appropriately guided by two key criteria set out in the Constitution, specifically the maximum limit of one TD per 30,000 persons and the principle of proportional representation, which, in our view and in the view of Professor Gallagher and other political scientists, requires that move to constituencies with higher seat numbers and a move away from three-seaters. In our submission to the commission, the Labour Party outlined in extensive detail our views on these provisions, but our arguments were not taken on board to the extent that we would have liked, clearly. The commission, as I have said, was restricted in its freedom of manoeuvre most critically by the size of constituencies it was allowed to propose. We sought to amend that, and the Government opposed that. The ability to provide for six-seater constituencies would, in our view, have made the commission's task much easier, would have made the report and the findings much more robust and would have enabled better future-proofing. Again, that is a critique we have of the process because we do not think - again, there was a fairly wide interpretation - that the findings are sufficiently future-proofed. Given the growing population and demographic change, it would have been infinitely preferable for the commission to have been asked to look at a much longer-term fix for the issue it was given. For the first time in this process, the Minister and the Government gave the commission a range of possible future seats for the next Dáil rather than clearly defining a set number. There may have been some political expediency to that. It ensured that it was not the Government itself that recommended the creation of a number of new TDs, but it did leave the commission with an unenviable task. It could have interpreted this, though, as meaning that the Oireachtas was comfortable with a ""future-proofing"" approach, and it could have taken more discretion on this but it seemed to have decided that the terms of reference governed or overrode its discretion as to seat numbers. It picked a number that best enabled it to meet the other terms of reference. It retained the established precedent to leave the Ceann Comhairle with a casting vote. The commission's work was clearly necessary because all bar one of the current constituencies breached the constitutional maximum of 30,000 people per TD due to population growth. Between 2016 and 2022, the overall population grew by 7.6%. We all knew, therefore that an additional number of seats - at least 12 - would be required to bring the national ratio of population below 30,000. As we said in our submission, 20 new seats would have been appropriate to avoid the radical reshaping of constituency boundaries that has resulted in some cases, to ensure that future-proofing could be maintained and to ensure that constituencies would be adaptable to continued population growth. Instead, as we know, the commission proposed an increase of 14, to 174 seats, structured across 43 constituencies, 16 of which breach the constitutional limit of 30,000 people. While the most recent rate of growth in population may not be maintained over the next five years, even a lower increase, say of 5%, in the current population would require a 180-seat Dáil for a population per TD of just under the constitutional limit. Twenty additional seats would therefore have provided greater certainty into the future and would have avoided many individual constituencies being over the constitutional limit. The commission has also recommended constituency sizes with much larger variances than had been the case in previous years, ranging from 8.08% to -8.13%. In Clare we will see 31,985 people per TD versus 27,186 in Kildare South. There will be quite a wide variance. The usual rule in the past had been 5% variance. There had been a number of court cases litigating the issue. The commission spoke about a somewhat flexible approach; therefore, it noted it would have to recommend in a limited number of cases a variance of greater than 5%. It went as far, it acknowledges, as 8.13% when this resulted in the restoration of a currently breached county boundary or the avoidance of recommending a new breach. Clearly, therefore, it was very cognisant in its report of the criteria it had been given. It was struggling, it seems, to maintain county boundaries as far as possible. We are still seeing some unfortunate consequences of that. We think there was not enough regard to future-proofing because the necessary review of boundaries after the next census, it seems, will have to go through this entire exercise again, presumably with some equally unfortunate consequences. What is the point of continuity - the commission refers to the desire to maintain continuity - if you know you will have to change continuity again in five years' time? It should be noted that in the submissions to the commission, the undesirability of breaching county boundaries was the issue most often raised. People really care about this. It is a huge issue to breach county boundaries, to move people in and out of constituencies which they may have become very accustomed to voting in. In particular, the deployment of three-seaters has meant, as Professor Gallagher writes, that the outcome of votes in a particular constituency will simply not be reflective of the way people have voted in that constituency. The whole point of the PR-STV system is to ensure as accurate as possible a reflection of the way people vote in the representatives who are elected, so this is a really serious issue. Not allowing six-seat constituencies tied the hands of the commission to act. It was clear even before the publication of the report that by not allowing six-seat constituencies we would see breaches of county boundaries, either in this redraw or in the next, which we now know will be inevitable due to the failure to future-proof. I can list for the Minister of State the currently existing five-seaters, which we all knew will require some change if population growth is to be adequately accounted for with a large enough Dáil: Dublin Fingal, Donegal, Tipperary, Wicklow, Wexford and so on. The need to allow six-seaters to be included was extensively raised, as the Minister of State knows, in previous debates. The failure of the Green Party to secure an amendment dictated, in effect, the outcome of the commission report. Again, I suppose that is the  We therefore believe the commission should have been more cognisant of the nature and purpose of our electoral system, PR-STV, in multi-seat constituencies. It is unusual in comparative terms to have this system, but we are all, I think, very mindful of just how democratic it is because we know such a system is designed to ensure that, as far as practicable, no vote cast is wasted, even vote No. 18 in a constituency with 18 candidates. It continues to work in the course of the electoral count until a most effective form of representation is achieved. This ensures a proportionate overall result in terms of a parliamentary configuration that matches the votes cast. I think all of us adhere to that principle and see it as infinitely preferable to the first-past-the-post model we see in our neighbouring jurisdiction across the water. The commission itself, it is clear, believed that the failure to include a requirement to future-proof limited its options, and that absence was used by the commission, maybe, as the reason to provide for the more conservative increase in the number of TDs. The commission adopted a generally indifferent approach to constituency magnitude. It said there was no guidance in the terms of reference as to whether a review should favour any particular magnitude within the terms set of three-, four- or five-seat constituencies. The commission acknowledged that in the submissions it received, there was a clear preference for more five-seat constituencies and a general view that there should be a reduction in the number of three-seat constituencies. It stated: ""These [submissions] were mostly based on the view that constituencies with larger seat numbers provide for more proportional results, and allow for more choice for the electorate."" It is unfortunate the commission did not engage on this argument having made that statement, which is self-evidently true. It is somewhat bizarre that having acknowledged the bulk of the submissions and the basis for them, the commission then went on to increase the number of three-seaters by four to 13 in total. It said it took the general view that there should be a reasonably even distribution between three-, four- and five-seat constituencies. That flies in the face of the evidence-based submissions, however. The commission does not give any reason for taking this approach. The commission states that it ""endeavoured to tailor the constituency size and number of seats to the population and circumstances of each constituency"". It noted in passing that, while the majority of submissions proposed more five-seat constituencies, it was cognisant that ""given the anticipated continued rise in population, it may not be possible to retain the current 5 seat county constituencies in future reviews"". Again, the commission is acknowledging lack of future-proofing that is built into this. The reality is that more three-seaters produce a skewed result under the proportional representation single transferable vote, PRSTV, system that does not represent fully the views of the votes cast by the electorate. That is self-evidently true. The 2017 proposals represented a positive shift in thinking when the number of three-seat constituencies decreased from 13 to nine, and the number of five-seater constituencies increased from 11 to 13. That work has been has been partially undone. I believe I am correct in those figures. That is regrettable The commission should be guided by the fundamental need to ensure as close an approximation as possible between votes cast and the seats won, so that PR is achieved in practice as well as in theory. Moving now to the recommendations, it is noteworthy that for the first time some of the decisions of the commission were leaked in advance and were circulating in political circles. It may be well-known where the leak came from, but it is not good practice. It certainly has been a difficult period for those individual representatives most affected by redrawn boundaries but, more importantly, for their voters and for the communities represented by them. The UK's Electoral Commission publishes draft constituency boundaries for further public consultation. That practice would be welcome here because it would eliminate the surprise element and would allow people in different communities affected by constituency redrawings to absorb and respond to what was being proposed. The only other alternative is for local communities having to wait for another five years before they can mobilise a campaign to get boundary changes reversed because there have been some bizarre decisions. The hybrid Wicklow-Wexford constituency has been the subject of much public commentary. This would have been avoided if two six-seaters could have been created instead. With Tipperary split into two three-seaters, a portion of north Kilkenny was redrawn across provincial lines. Again, six-seaters would have addressed this change. In Cork we saw the most unlikely and bizarre redrawing. The town of Mallow, long a feature of Cork East constituency, has been transferred to the Cork North-Central constituency without its hinterland. It was joined there along with Ballincollig, an urban area south of the Lee with no real connection to north Cork. No submission to the commission called for this hodgepodge of a change, yet that is what those voters must now live with for the next general election. There was no justification given by the commission for the radical changes it made. An opportunity for the public to see draft boundaries would avoid mistakes like this happening. We should say that in my Dublin Bay South constituency, although there was relatively minimal change, nonetheless, the electoral division of Kimmage C, which I have been proud to represent and I have worked really hard in along with my Labour Party colleagues, has now gone into Dublin South-Central. That is a community that has moved over successive boundary redraws between Dublin South-Central and what was Dublin South-East constituencies. That is not really particularly democratic. I regularly find when I am canvassing doors in the Kimmage C ward that people ask me if they are going back again. They have been moved back and forth. I do not believe it is respectful to particular communities that have very distinctive views and concerns to be constantly on the boundary and on the fence between different Dáil constituencies. I do not believe that that is helpful or appropriate. The Labour Party will certainly be making a submission to the commission when it is seeking views on its proposed research programme. We welcome the move by the commission to write to Deputies asking for views. That is very sensible and it is sensible to hear the commission say that it will be looking now at the number of Deputies appropriate in the context of a rising population and the size of constituencies. We will, again, be making those arguments we have made previously to phase out three-seaters and to create six-seat constituencies to ensure fixed boundaries and constituencies as far as possible. Any move to limit the size of the Dáil and the ratio of Deputies to population would have to be aligned with a strengthening of local government. The Minister of State will have noted that a recent report adopted by the Council of Europe shows Irish local government is ranked fourth weakest among 46 European states. This is a very serious concern that at local government level we are seeing the powers and responsibilities of elected councillors being eroded. There are other measures which need to be looked at in the context of the commission's research programme. The use of posters in election campaigns, which we support, is a critical part of a democracy enabling new candidates to establish themselves and to become known. I note that the question of by-elections is also being discussed. I also want to use this opportunity to briefly note that our dear friend and colleague, Senator David Norris, has announced today that he will be retiring from politics in January, thereby triggering a by-election in the Seanad. I pay tribute to David. I had the pleasure and honour of working with him in the Seanad for many years. He has been a great friend and dear colleague. I know that we will all miss him. I just want to refer to that. People would say that I would be against replacing by-elections, particularly as I was elected in one. We need to see more research on the issue. We need to look at lowering the voter age to 16, something we in the Labour Party support. We need to look at the widening of the franchise to citizens living abroad and other matters. The Constitutional Convention addressed a number of these issues in 2013 and we have had numerous reports on Seanad electoral reform. All of these are matters which should be reviewed appropriately in the commission's research programme. We accept the commission's findings, but it is worth noting the flaws in the process and, in particular, the move away from larger constituencies, which is regrettable."	spk_99

We warned last year that the failure to extend the ban on evictions would lead to a massive increase in the number of people without a home. Sadly, that has come to pass. The September homelessness figures were published a fortnight ago, as the Dáil went into recess. Those figures showed that 12,827 people are now without a home in Ireland. Let us contrast that with the figures when the Government came to power in July 2020, when there were 8,728 people registered as homeless. In the space of just over three years, the Government has, shockingly, managed to increase homelessness by more than 4,000 women, men and children. That is a surge of almost 50%. Has the Government become desensitised to the gravity of these enormous figures? Behind every figure, there is an individual person – a woman, man or child – who has been left without a home. This is the desperate reality. Will the Minister admit that the Government's housing policy has failed? Ministers say endlessly that we cannot build houses overnight – of course, we cannot – but across the board, the Government's actions in the past three years have undermined its stated aims of keeping people in affordable and secure homes. The Government will not act to restrict no-fault evictions to keep people in their homes. It will not act to impose a use-it-or-lose-it obligation on developers who speculate on land. That has been delayed. Just this morning, it has become clear that the Government will also not face up to its responsibility to fund local authorities to bring vacant homes back into use and provide social homes. In oral questions to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage this morning, I raised a concerning situation, which has been brought to my attention by my Labour Party colleague, a Dublin city councillor for the south-west inner city, Darragh Moriarty.

Next week, our Labour Party colleagues in the Seanad will be bringing a motion to address vacancy and dereliction and will address some of the other issues the Minister raised. Sufficient funding for local authorities to tackle voids and bring empty and derelict homes back into use and to operate the vacant and derelict sites register is a critical issue. It will be raised in the Seanad next week as well. It appears to us as if the Government is guilty of a dereliction of duty here.It is taking a hands-off approach and washing its hands at central government level. It is blaming local authorities and placing the responsibility on them, yet not funding them adequately to deliver the refurbishments necessary to bring vacant and derelict properties back into use and put more people into the homes they so desperately need.	spk_247
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-11-08	dail	33	Home Care Workers and Home Support Scheme: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_6	I will be sharing time with Deputy Nash. I commend our colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, on introducing this very important motion which I know is close to his own heart and to all of our hearts. It is vital that we give recognition for home care workers and home helps who, as Deputy Smith has said, are indeed the unsung heroes of our healthcare system. I think we can all agree on that. They provide an incredible service and those who receive care from them are deeply appreciative of the work they do. They are mostly women and all of us know many women who provide home care services. I recently met one woman who had been doing home help work for decades, as so many have. She started out, as so many did, almost as a voluntary sort of charity worker. I think the amount being paid that was £1 an hour and it was a sort of gratuity system. Over the years I have met groups representing home helps who wanted to move the recognition of their work from that sort of gratuity-based almost voluntary system to the more professional service we have today. However, unfortunately that cultural view of home helps still remains. One woman who has been working as a home help for years says that she has to race between clients, that she is on the clock, and that she does not feel she has the time to give her clients the warmth and the social connection which is such an integral part of home help work. Deputy Duncan Smith spoke about the recruitment and retention crisis. That is how it is felt at the sharp end by those, mostly women, who are providing care in the home. The figures speak for themselves and the Minister of State is well aware of them. Some 6,000 people on the waiting list have been assessed for home support but simply cannot access it.There are 18,000 care home carers but only 5,300 of them are directly employed by the HSE. The majority of home carers work in the private sector, often with poor pay and conditions. We need to see a real rewrite of our system of home care. The Labour Party's motion seeks to provide for the essential reforms required. In my work last year chairing the Joint Committee on Gender Equality, the experience of hearing those who provide care and their representatives and from those who need care really brought home to me the need for a really serious reform of our system. We need a better way, a new system that can put an end to unfair pay and conditions that leave workers like the woman I met burned out and struggling to make ends meet - the kind of system that could keep our older people and friends and relatives with disabilities out of hospitals and care homes and in the comfort of their homes. We need a system that will enable families to be assured that the funding will be available for what should be an essential State service. A reformed system would also bridge the gender gap between women and men in terms of work in the care economy and for those who require care. Our motion seeks to achieve real reform. It is disappointing that the Government tabled an amendment to the motion. Reading the text of the Government amendment might lead someone to believe nothing is wrong with the system and that no one is on a waiting list. We all know that is not true. I know the Minister of State is well aware of that. She has been critical of shortcomings in the system. The Labour Party cannot accept the countermotion. We will press our motion and I am proud to second it. We do not suggest that fixing the broken and patchwork system will be easy but it is not helpful to pretend the problem does not exist or that the system is working for everyone when it is not. My colleagues in the Labour Party will speak to other aspects of the motion such as some of the key ways the system needs to be fixed. In the brief time left, I will focus on the need for a referendum to recognise care work. We in this House accepted and the Joint Committee on Gender Equality unanimously accepted that it is required, yet the Government amendment does not even mention the referendum on care work. As Deputy Duncan Smith said, the Government committed to the referendum to amend Article 41 of the Constitution to delete the sexist language around women and mothers and replace it with an important text that would recognise the value of care and acknowledge the State's role in supporting care inside and outside the home. It is frustrating that the Government has apparently abandoned plans to hold the referendum this year. On International Women's Day in March, the Taoiseach announced it would take place in 2023, as the Minister of State will be aware, yet we have heard nothing since. The Government has failed to honour its commitment to hold a vote and that failure and that delay emphasises the Government's undervaluing of care. It is no coincidence that we see the work of carers so denigrated by State policies. Most carers, as I have said, are women and many are also from migrant backgrounds. They feel undervalued by the Government and the delay in holding the referendum and the failure of the Government to even say when it will be held contributes to the sense of being undervalued. The Labour Party's motion would address that and ensure the work carers do is truly valued by the State and it clearly sets out a pathway to achieving the valuing of care work. We urge the Government to accept it.	spk_12
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-11-08	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_7	"Cúram dár dtuismitheoirí agus dár sean-thuismitheoirí; an bhfuil aon rud níos tábhachtaí? Irish society knows well the value of caring for the older people in our society, the value of community and the right of everyone to live with dignity but those values are simply not reflected in the Government’s policies and actions on home care. That was evident from this morning's debate on the Labour Party motion on supports in the home-care sector. We know there are approximately 6,000 people across the country who are stuck on a waiting list for home support, having been assessed. That is no way to reward older people who have contributed to Irish society and our economy over their whole lives. They deserve care and support to live a happy and fulfilled life in their own homes. The State is supposed to care for its citizens but it is failing those who are denied access to care in their own homes - many of us know people who are in that position - and those who have been trapped in acute hospitals for over a year at a time due to delayed discharges, as revealed by Deputy Kelly just now. This is due to the avoidable recruitment and retention crisis in the home-care sector. We would have expected to see drastic and radical action from the Government in budget 2024 to tackle this crisis, particularly with an ageing population and overcrowded hospitals, but that is not the path the Government chose with its health budget. Instead, it has frozen recruitment, which is extraordinary. Yet, some of the most important work in the country is provided by the unsung heroes, as Deputy Duncan Smith said, namely, those who work in the home-care sector providing care in people's homes. These workers are mostly women and are among the most undervalued professionals in our society. They are particularly undervalued when it comes to pay and conditions. This year, under pressure, the hourly pay for healthcare support assistants in the private sector was increased. That is welcome but that move was funded by quietly cutting home support hours by 1.9 million hours this year. We might call that ""robbing Peter to pay Paul"" or, more appropriately, ""robbing Patricia to pay Paula"" because these workers are mostly women. There is no plan to ensure a living wage for these workers into the future and no plan to ensure the system will work for those who need care. It is simply not working. When an older person cannot be discharged from hospital or cannot access care at home, their health outcomes are affected. It is fundamentally unfair to older people and their friends and families. So often, I hear from people – again, mostly women – who are hit with the double whammy of caring for their children and their ageing parents, often while holding down a full-time job. These are women who are struggling and panicking and do not know how to keep the plates spinning. As long as the State services are not there, they will have no option but to keep them spinning. That is why the Labour Party brought a motion this morning calling on the Government to make real reforms to the home-care service system and ensure we will be able to cater for an ageing population and a workforce struggling with the ever-increasing cost of living. Instead of pressing the Government's whitewashing amendment to a vote this evening, will the Taoiseach accept the motion and work with us and others across the House to pay Ireland’s heroic home-care workers their worth, reverse the ridiculous embargo on recruitment and ensure that Ireland becomes a place where care is genuinely valued and older persons can receive the care they so desperately need in their homes?"	spk_67
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-11-08	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_7	The Taoiseach's response did not address the crucial issues. I will spell them out. The crucial issues, which are evidenced in the Government's and the HSE's figures, include, first, the lack of healthcare workers. There are simply not enough healthcare workers to meet the need. The second crucial issue is the number of people who are awaiting care, having been assessed for home-care supports, and simply cannot access it because of the lack of workers. The third is poor pay and conditions across the healthcare sector. Notwithstanding the new tender, the Ministers of State at the Department of Health, Deputies Butler and Rabbitte, in response to our motion, admitted what we all know to be the case, namely, that we cannot be sure that the new rate of €13.10 per hour, basic though it is, is being passed on in the private sector. The truth is we have seen a creeping privatisation of home-care services. That is having a knock-on effect on recruitment and retention. It means we simply do not have enough home-care workers to meet the crucial demand for older persons, persons who are awaiting discharge from hospital and persons who desperately need care in their homes to be able to live with dignity into older age in a way we would all wish to do. The Taoiseach has not addressed those crucial issues.	spk_69

That would be very useful in the spirit of trying to achieve a cross-party approach from Irish legislators on the appalling situation in Gaza.

We are hearing increasingly desperate pleas for help from those who currently see no way out with their families and who are not appearing on the lists of those who apparently are to be allowed to make the Rafah crossing.

Today marks one month since the brutal massacre of civilians in Israel by Hamas. It is a devastating anniversary. Since then, we have seen the brutal bombardment by Israel of the people of Gaza, bringing about 10,000 deaths, including 4,000 children and unprecedented numbers of journalists and aid workers killed so brutally. Our thoughts go to all those bereaved and the family of eight-year-old Emily Hand, presumed abducted by Hamas, the family of Zac Hania and all the Irish citizens trapped in Gaza with no way out. We have worked with the Taoiseach and other parties to secure strong support in the Dáil for a motion calling for an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages and the provision of humanitarian aid. In the spirit of that collaboration, I ask that we continue to work with him and that the Government provide Opposition leaders with briefings on the ongoing situation, particularly on the plight of the Irish citizens who have been so severely impacted there but also the attempts at European level to draw support for the crucial call for an immediate ceasefire so that the killings of children will stop.	spk_69
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-11-07	dail	33	Housing: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_16	The housing crisis is the civil rights issue of our times here in Ireland. There is real agreement on that across the House. We all know that the social consequences of failed housing policy are massive for people from all walks of life. Young professionals and even workers on what would be considered good wages are stuck in their childhood bedrooms into their thirties and forties because they cannot afford to buy or even rent a place of their own. Parents who rent have to contend with the stress of securing a place for their children in a local school or childcare facility while worrying that an eviction notice will uproot them from that support network. Our social welfare and pension system is predicated on a presumption that those who reach pension age will have achieved mortgage-free home ownership but that presumption, unfortunately, no longer holds water. Now we are all seeing in our constituencies pensioners who have paid taxes and contributed to the economy their whole lives but cannot now find anywhere to live if they face eviction from rental properties. Frankly, it is unconscionable. I commend Deputy Ó Broin and his colleagues for tabling this important motion, which we support. However, we all recognise that this is just the latest in a series of Opposition motions on housing calling on the Minister and his Government to do better. My hope is that one day one of these motions will prompt the Minister to realise that Government policies are not working and that it is time to change. This motion focuses on capital expenditure and that is a crucial point, for sure. The notion that the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government is unable to spend its budget is extraordinary. One would almost think that there is no crisis and that everything is fine but we know, of course, that is not the case and all of our constituents tell us it is not the case. Economic analysis that the Labour Party commissioned shows that at least another €1 billion is needed to be invested by the State in the delivery of housing. Overall, we would allocate over €1.6 billion more in capital to provide for the delivery of social and affordable homes in 2024. It is not just about the allocation of capital, although that is crucial; it is also about urgent adoption of more ambitious targets. We have been calling on the Minister to recognise that the targets set in Housing for All, just two years on, are themselves inadequate. The Minister, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste denied that the targets were inadequate but more recently the Taoiseach quietly admitted in the Dáil, in response to a question I put, that the targets are too low. Indeed, the Government's countermotion refers to a review and refresh of Housing for All targets that is under way and which, we understand, will be produced early in the new year. There is a recognition there that the targets are set too low, there has been too little ambition from the Government and too little recognition of the true need for housing that exists. Of course, it is not just about the adoption of more ambitious targets; it is also about the adoption of the necessary measures to achieve delivery on targets. Again, the Government has failed on that. We are seeing a lack of delivery of real social and affordable homes for people. This is about a lack of delivery as much as a lack of ambitious targets. The Labour Party, by contrast, has called for the delivery of 1 million homes over ten years, an ambitious target which would mean the building of 50,000 new homes every year.That is the need that is recognised in the expert opinion of the Government's advisers. Also needed is the provision of 50,000 homes per year through deep retrofit and restoration of vacant and derelict properties. An essential part of any sustainable construction programme must be retrofit and restoration of properties. I will speak more on vacancy momentarily. As regards the construction workforce planning that is needed, every time we hear from the Government that a plan to deliver that level of housing is unachievable, its reason for that not being achievable is that there is not a sufficient workforce in place. In government, however, it can do things to address that. It can embark on an ambitious and proactive recruitment programme to expand the categories of critical skills for which visas will be provided. It can embark on an enhanced apprenticeship and training programme. It can adopt measures such as the construction skills courses that have been rolled out in facilities such as St. Andrew's Resource Centre in my constituency. There are ways to ensure we have enough workers in place but the reality is the Government does not have the plans to ensure delivery. I wish to address vacancy. Vacancy and dereliction amount to a national scandal - an insult to all those unable to afford a home. It is obvious to anyone who walks through an urban centre that there are boarded-up houses that could become homes for those who so desperately need them, with 13,000 people on the homelessness list. The Labour Party has launched a national campaign to tackle vacancy and dereliction, seeking to use existing mechanisms and calling on members of the public to log empty sites near them on the vacant and derelict sites registers maintained by local authorities. We are not seeing any sort of commensurate approach by the Government, however, to tackle vacancy and dereliction. We need to see much more proactive policies adopted. Properties which are left vacant for prolonged periods should be subject to compulsory purchase and local authorities need to be resourced adequately to do so. I heard recently from my colleague, Councillor Darragh Moriarty, who is a member of Dublin City Council, that rather than taking that sort of proactive approach, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is reducing the subvention to Dublin City Council for the conversion of voids into homes. We are hearing that is happening. I know the Minister has denied it but we are hearing this on the ground. We have heard of an apparent decision to abandon one of the few saving graces of recent housing plans, namely, a mechanism to strip planning permission from developers who sit on vacant land that could be used for homes. These are the sorts of measures that could be used to crack down on vacancy but we are not seeing them being brought in. We are not seeing any attempt to adopt a use-it-or-lose-it approach to ensure people are incentivised to move on planning permissions that have been granted, rather than sitting on them and speculating further. We are also seeing a lack of action from the Government on renters' rights. In anticipation of this debate, I looked at properties in my constituency on  This crisis is due to market failure. The question remains as to why the Government is addicted to always returning to the private market and hands-off regulation to solve a crisis that was caused by market failure. Almost half of all properties in my constituency of Dublin Bay South are rented on the private market. There is a very high proportion of renters in the constituency yet people cannot find homes to rent. They are simply not available in any affordable sense. During the pandemic, however, we saw the impact a temporary no-fault eviction ban can have on preventing homelessness. In 2021, the Labour Party proposed a strong renters’ rights Bill, namely, the Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill, that would provide real protections for those in rented homes and end no-fault evictions. It is not a radical proposition. In most European countries, it is forbidden to kick a good tenant out of their home and this sort of eviction ban is standard. I hope the Minister will realise the need to put a measure like this back into place, even for this winter. We are not hearing anything from the Government about what it is proposing to do for those facing eviction and families and children facing homelessness this winter. That is a serious issue. We need to move into a space where examining policies around basic renters' rights protections is something the Government will take on, rather than it always being contained in Opposition motions. Finally, I will refer to housing legislation put forward by the Labour Party some years ago. The Minister will be aware that in 2017 the Dáil voted in support of Labour’s Housing (Homeless Families) Bill, which would create a statutory obligation to prevent families entering homelessness. It progressed to Second Stage, with support from Fianna Fáil at the time, I should add. I have written to the Cathaoirleach of the housing committee, seeking leave to commence Committee Stage of the Bill. I have also written to the Minister, Deputy O'Brien. I remind him of the need to progress that legislation. It is a simple and straightforward Bill that does not require extensive review and should not take long to implement. It is supported by NGOs, including organisations working to address homelessness. The Bill would simply give recognition to the rights of children in homelessness or at risk of entering homelessness. It would oblige the State to have regard to those rights when homelessness is going to touch the life of a family. I appeal to the Minister to at least take on that Bill and the measure that is perhaps the most obvious means at his disposal to address the risk of children entering homelessness. We are all agreed that is the sharpest end of the housing crisis. At the start of my contribution, I referred to the many different people from various walks of life who are affected by the housing crisis but children in homelessness - the thousands of children who have to do homework in hotel rooms, have nowhere to bring friends back to play, no gardens and nowhere they can call their own - are the sharp end. That is what this motion and all of us speaking in favour of it are most keen to address tonight.	spk_340

We in the Labour Party have been repeating the same mantra, that the Government needs to build more houses and it needs to raise its targets for housing because they are too low. Yesterday I pointed out the mystery of the missing billions with the absence of any indication as to where the Land Development Agency or the lame duck agency is to get the necessary funding to be able to deliver the housing that is so badly needed. Today I want to raise the issue of targets that are set to low. We have called for more ambitious targets to be set by the Government. Today, if more evidence were needed, it is clear from the report that Dr. Ronan Lyons from Trinity College is going to be pointing out at a conference of Engineers Ireland that the Government must double the target of 33,000 new homes per year. Dr. Lyons says 74,000 new homes per year are needed, based on demographic demand. We also hear from Simon Communities about an abject shortage of properties for those on housing assistance payment, HAP. When will we see the necessary revision of the targets the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is now saying are under review and how will we solve the mystery of the missing billions?	spk_90
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-10-25	dail	33	Pre-European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_18	We engage today for these statements in the context of the brutal events that are continuing in the Middle East and at a critical juncture for the European Union. The meeting of European Heads of Government at the European Council meeting on Thursday, which the Taoiseach will be attending, is undoubtedly a critical test for our European Union, which bills itself as a voice for peace and security and, indeed, as a transnational entity that is bound to uphold the rule of law and international humanitarian law. We have seen already this week a meeting on Monday of EU foreign affairs ministers at which it was not possible, it seems, to agree even on a call for a ceasefire. Instead, they settled only on a humanitarian pause for Gaza, which is simply not enough, as we know and as we have heard from UN workers on the ground in Gaza. What we need to see is a unanimous call at the Council meetings on Thursday and Friday from European leaders for the release of Israeli hostages by Hamas but also for a humanitarian ceasefire, as the UN has sought and as the vast majority of this House, both Government and Opposition, called for in our cross-party motion last week. I thank the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste for engaging with us in the Opposition on the wording of that motion. It was really important we were able to send a united voice, insofar as possible, from this House in condemning Hamas and the appalling slaughter of civilians by Hamas on 7 October but also condemning the utterly brutal bombardment of the people of Gaza by Israel since then, which we understand has now led to the deaths of about 5,000 civilians. That purported response by Israel has been so clearly in breach of international law, in the collective punishment of 2 million civilians, the forced evacuation, the bombardment and besiegement, and the denial of vital supplies of food and water. All these things amount to breaches of international law and of the rules of war. I know the Taoiseach has spoken out on that but we need to hear a united voice from the European Council this week speaking out on it. We need to hear that very clearly because, as the Secretary General of the United Nations, António Guterres, has said, there is a context to this and the context is the point at which the 2 million people of Gaza, even before 7 October, were already merely existing in what has often been described as an open-air prison, utterly dependent on UN aid supplies. Now we see those awful conditions for the people of Gaza worsened even further. Over recent years, the right-wing Netanyahu governments in Israel have become increasingly extreme, consciously dismantling, it seems, the prospect of a two-state solution, which many of us, including us in the Labour Party, hold to still. They have been consciously dismantling that prospect by subdividing the West Bank, encouraging illegal settlements and colonising East Jerusalem through the forced displacement of Palestinians. That far-right Government in Israel and the brutal government of Hamas in the Gaza Strip have, it seems, almost tilted the other to the extreme, trapped in a gruesome cycle of violence. It is at this point, therefore, that we need to ensure the EU is speaking with one voice in calling out Israel for breaches of international law and in reviewing its trade relationship with Israel as it perpetrates genocidal actions in Gaza and sustains an apartheid regime in the West Bank. Indeed, we in the Labour Party have called on the Taoiseach to see the occupied territories Bill passed into law and to see further sanctions on Israel in recognition of what has been done to Palestinians for so long. We have stood for and called for the recognition of the state of Palestine and for the self-determination of the Palestinian people. We are very concerned to see the actions of Israel in apparently refusing to issue visas to UN staff in response to the comments of the Secretary General, António Guterres, who was merely stating the obvious. We do need to see, therefore, the European Council condemn Israeli actions in breaching international law while also, of course, condemning the brutality of Hamas. What we have seen instead, unfortunately, were the uncontrolled actions of an unelected Commission, with the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, going rogue.She took on a plenipotentiary role, going way beyond her powers and mandate by apparently offering unconditional support for the actions of the Israeli Government. She thereby undermined the office of European Council President, Charles Michel, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, but also undermined the authority of the Council. She did not speak for Ireland, and she undermined the adherence to the treaties and rule of law that underpins the essence of the European Union. By contrast, President Higgins has spoken admirably on the context of the situation, and it is most unfortunate we have seen an intervention by the Israeli ambassador in Ireland, which is inappropriate in criticising the President. We all want to see relief for the people of Gaza, the immediate supply of aid and the immediate provision for a ceasefire. We urge the Taoiseach to make that call, in keeping with our cross-party motion, at the Council meeting this week.	spk_176

Our thoughts are also with Anthony Burke who so bravely spoke out about the attack on him too. We are all watching the appalling situation and rising death toll in Gaza with increasing distress and horror but today I do want to raise a different issue with the Taoiseach, which is the issue of housing. It is not just in healthcare that we find gaping holes in the Taoiseach's Government budget. There are missing billions in housing too. On budget day in a surprise announcement the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, told us that he would seek Cabinet approval for an additional €6 billion for the Land Development Agency. This was a welcome announcement but a peculiar one because neither the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael McGrath, nor the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, had mentioned it in their budget day speeches. We are now two weeks on and it is not clear where that mystery €6 billion will come from. Is the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, perhaps hoping to find it down the back of a couch? Whatever is going on I hope it will materialise soon because he is fast becoming known as the Minister for initiatives and not for delivery. In a rare twist I agree with him and I hope that he soon finds that €6 billion and that he and his Department get their act together soon. The housing crisis is the civil rights issue for this generation. It is not going to fix itself. Those who are renting, who are stuck with unaffordable rents, and who remain in permanent fear of eviction are at the sharp end of this housing crisis. It is now seven months on from the lifting of the temporary no-fault eviction ban. It is seven months since the announcement of the first refusal scheme that was a half-hearted half measure for contingencies for renters. It is seven months on and we are finally seeing the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, bringing legislation to the Cabinet just today. It is incredible that this measure is taking so long to implement. What kind of message does that send to renters who are at the sharp end of the housing crisis and who are still in fear of eviction? The Taoiseach's Government has failed renters and has failed to fix the housing crisis. The Government has even failed to secure and ensure additional adequate and robust legislative powers for the Land Development Agency, LDA. This is the very body that was supposed to be the vehicle to deliver on the necessary increased housing supply in this chronic housing shortage. The Taoiseach may be aware that a change in terminology by the Central Statistics Office has meant some provisions in the Act that create compulsory purchase powers for the Land Development Agency, LDA, have now been rendered ineffective. The irony is that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage was on the working group that decided to make this change in terminology, a change that we in the Labour Party pointed out will result in the need for amending legislation to restore adequate, robust powers to the Land Development Agency.In the absence of those powers, we might call the LDA the Lame Duck Agency. Where is the additional €6 billion for the Land Development Agency? Can the Taoiseach ensure that the agency will have the robust powers it needs to deliver on housing? What can the Government offer renters who remain in fear of eviction, given the first refusal scheme is still not in place and there is no prospect, it seems, of reintroducing a temporary ban on no-fault evictions this winter?	spk_12

It is not good enough when we see nearly 13,000 people in emergency accommodation, almost 4,000 of whom are children, and when we see more than two thirds of people aged between 25 and 29 still living in their childhood bedrooms at home with their parents, tens of thousands who are whittling away their savings on rent when they want to be able to afford and buy a home of their own. Those are the figures that matter. I did not hear any reassurance from the Taoiseach that the LDA would be adequately capitalised. Indeed, he admitted that it got off to a slow start. There is no doubt about that. When it was first mooted, the Land Development Agency was expected to deliver 150,000 homes in 20 years. That was the announcement. Now that forecast has been reduced to just 10,000 homes in five years. That is the problem with this Government on housing. It keeps moving the goalposts and it refuses, or neglects, to resource adequately the very vehicles that are required to deliver the housing necessary to fix and address this chronic housing shortage. Who is going to take responsibility for capitalising the Land Development Agency? How much money will be given to it? When will we see the focus shift from glossy announcements of new initiatives to actual delivery of real homes for people who so badly need them?	spk_14

I will return to this later. I want to raise the issue of healthcare spending. Last Tuesday the Government presented a ""Once upon a time, in a land far, far away"" sort of budget that was full of gaps with dodgy estimates. It has been exposed in many ways as a work of fiction. Nowhere is this clearer than in the health spend. The Government announced a health budget with a €2 billion hole in it. Bernard Gloster, the CEO of the HSE, has said the moneys allocated to the health service in the budget are inadequate and the funding is not sufficient to meet the expected demand for health services. This is very serious. The front page of today's edition of the  The freeze on recruitment is outrageous. Having begged doctors, nurses and healthcare workers not to leave us for Australia and other places, the Government has effectively turned around and said never mind that. This week HIQA reported that staffing in hospitals such as St. James's Hospital and Mercy University Hospital is at a critically low level. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, is warning us that the recruitment freeze will send the healthcare system into freefall. Adding insult to injury were the comments of the Taoiseach in the Dáil on Tuesday, when he played down what he termed ""talk"" of a recruitment and retention crisis, one that we all hear about all the time in our constituencies. The Tánaiste's Government's refusal to return to the rest of us here on Earth is evident throughout the budget on health. More than 4,000 patients may be unable to access potentially life-saving treatments next year due to the decision not to provide dedicated funding for new drugs. We know that more than 6,000 people throughout the country are desperate for access to home care due to a lack of carers available. Almost 900,000 people languish on some form of health waiting list, more than 100,000 of whom are children and young people. Today we heard at the Committee on Public Accounts, under questioning from Deputy Kelly, that the new children's hospital is drifting further and further out of reach with a projected spend now of €2 billion. The blame lies squarely at the feet of the Government. Most galling of all is that we do not know who is responsible for the shortfall in funding. Is it the Minister for Health or the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform? Will the Tánaiste explain whether the Government can ensure safe staffing levels through the winter? What plan is there for the health service to ensure that sick people who present at hospital will not be left on trolleys or sitting on chairs?"	spk_175

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-10-18	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	We have all been watching the violence escalate in Israel and Gaza over the past 11 days with grave horror and distress, as civilian deaths have mounted. Late last night, we learned with increasing horror that an air strike on the al-Ahli Arab Hospital in besieged Gaza has killed many hundreds of people. An image which will stay with all of us is that of the press conference held by hospital staff surrounded by such appalling scenes of carnage. The Taoiseach has described it rightly as an atrocity and it clearly is only the latest in this awful conflict. They are still pulling bodies out of the rubble in that hospital and in the other residential areas of Gaza which have been under bombardment by Israel. I think all of us share the same human response of distress and grief to see this humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza unfolding before our eyes.  I listened to the Israeli ambassador’s response this morning which shamefully focused less on the human tragedy resulting from the attack on the hospital and more on the attribution of blame for the bombing of the hospital. Certainly, we believe, and I think the Taoiseach does too because the Tánaiste has said this, that there is now a need for an independent international investigation to be carried out into last night's attack on a hospital and that should be carried out by the International Criminal Court, which has accepted the mandate. The Tánaiste, as I say, has spoken in support of that.  What is undoubtedly the case is that even before last night’s attack, Israel had been committing horrific breaches of international law upon the people of Gaza. The bombardment of civilians and of civilian infrastructure, the siege and starvation tactics being deployed upon the people of Gaza and the forced evacuation of thousands into the south of this tiny open-air prison all amount to clear violations of international humanitarian law. Just as our legal framework at international level criminalises the barbaric acts of Hamas, which I have condemned, it also provides a clear framework which should be governing Israel's response. Any nation in any armed conflict, no matter what the provocation it claims, is bound in law to comply with internationally established laws of war, international laws and the Geneva Conventions. This much is evident: the besiegement and bombardment of civilians amount to clear breaches of those laws and those conventions. There is no space for equivocation on this. I believe that Ireland and the Irish Government need to be at the forefront of calls, at EU and UN level, for Israel to respect international humanitarian law. We need to speak with a united voice on that. That is why we, in Labour, have put forward a series of amendments to the motion the Government has proposed. I want us to be sure that we can take those amendments, that we can debate this and create a united voice for peace across the floor of this House. Will the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste accept our amendments, which would unreservedly condemn the collective punishment and the indiscriminate bombing of residential areas in Gaza and which would call for not only a humanitarian pause but an immediate ceasefire? I heard the Taoiseach's response earlier and he and the Government have been strong on that too. We need to speak with that united voice to ensure that we see relief for the appalling conditions of the citizens of Gaza.	spk_66
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-10-18	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	I thank the Taoiseach for the response. The response of Ireland and the international community clearly matters. It is time for the international community to call stop. While I agree with the three calls the Government has made, we need to do more. Ireland must do all we can, not only to bring about a ceasefire, to bring about, what the Taoiseach has described, the release of hostages and the restoring of power and of water to Gaza, but to ensure also that Israel is held accountable. I have already written to the President of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, seeking a stronger position from the EU on this. Today, I have also written to the US ambassador to Ireland, H.E. Ms Claire Cronin, because the Biden Administration should be pushing for an immediate ceasefire and for an end to the bombardment of Gaza and we should ensure that Israel is held accountable for breaches of international law. Following Hamas's horrific attack, which I have condemned as so many of us have, many countries have been reluctant to remind Israel of its international law obligations but it is at this times when grief in Israel is so raw that it is all the more important that we see a calm, a compassionate and, above all, an internationally legal response to the calamity that was inflicted on the people of Israel. We need to ensure that this hideous calamity that we are seeing unfold now for the people of Gaza is not allowed to continue and that Ireland is a strong voice at international level pushing for that ceasefire, for that restoration of power and services to Gaza, but also to hold a nation like Israel accountable where it commits war crimes.	spk_68

I wish them well. For many students, the education budget announced last week will have been a serious disappointment because once-off supports for schools have been cut to only €60 million, compared with €91 million last year. There was no permanent increase in capitation until September next year, 11 months away. For schools struggling with increased costs this winter, the once-off grant is lower and the cleaning grant is gone. There is particular concern for disadvantaged schools as the expansion of DEIS is leading to a dilution of focus. Yesterday, my colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, asked the Minister, Deputy Foley, about a specific commitment to fund a new focused DEIS plus scheme with trauma-informed supports for extremely disadvantaged schools. A group of 30 school principals is leading this campaign. As the Taoiseach says his priority is child poverty, will he agree to meet a delegation of the principals fighting for a DEIS plus scheme?

Indeed, it has shocked the world. Last week, we in the Labour Party condemned the horrific killing by Hamas of so many Israeli civilians, including women and children and, of course, the Irish citizen, Kim Damti, and the young daughter of an Irish citizen, Emily Hand. Since then, we have seen the horrific escalation of violence and an increasing death toll among civilians in Gaza as Israel has engaged in clear and egregious breaches of international law, which have brought about thousands of civilian deaths, again of women and children, in Gaza with the bombardment of residential areas, the destruction of civilian infrastructure, the besiegement and starvation of communities in Gaza and the forced displacement and evacuations. Last night's atrocity on the Gaza hospital brought home to us all the shocking reality of what is happening and how much worse it can and may get. Israel must be called to account for war crimes and breaches of international law. While there is much to commend in the Government motion, and I thank the Tánaiste for his engagement, it has been strengthened by engagement with Opposition parties. It is welcome to see so much in it with which we can all agree. However, the Labour Party has put down amendments. We are seeking to see in this motion a clear condemnation of Israel actions in breach of international law. We are seeking a call for the International Criminal Court to conduct an independent investigation into the atrocity in the hospital last night and condemnation of the actions of the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, in appearing to offer unqualified support for Israel without any requirement that it comply with international law. We are looking also, in our amendments, for recognition of the state of Palestine and support for the occupied territories Bill.We believe, as Deputy Howlin said, that Ireland can play a significant role in seeking, crucially, the immediate ceasefire that we all in this House want to see happen in the interest of the civilians both in Gaza and, indeed, in Israel who have suffered so much already. 	spk_212

On behalf of the Labour Party, I condemn outright the appalling slaughter by Hamas of civilians at the weekend. The targeting of Israeli civilians, of women and children, by Hamas was appalling and horrific to see. We believe the hostages must be released, as my colleague Deputy Howlin said in a statement on Sunday. Since Saturday, we have all watched in horror as we heard more detail about the attacks. We heard of attacks on young people attending a music festival, on children in their own homes, and the thought of parents who are still unable to make contact with their children, not even knowing if they are alive or dead, is unbearable. The thought of an Irish citizen, Kim Damti, being among those who are now missing and whose safety is unknown, is unbearable. Our thoughts are with her family and with all those affected. Our thoughts are also with the people of Gaza today. At the weekend, we in the Labour Party called for restraint by Israel in response to the Hamas attack, but since then we have all watched, in grave dismay, as Israel has unleashed missile attacks on residential areas in Gaza and cut off vital services to the civilian population. Israel has effectively placed the people of Gaza under siege, indefinitely it seems, with more than 1 million children now being subject to collective punishment in Gaza without any way of escaping. These actions by Israel must also be condemned outright. Indeed, both the Hamas attack and the Israeli response have already resulted in thousands of civilian deaths and we are seeing the region being plunged again into a terrible abyss of violence, with neither side to benefit and civilians bearing the brunt. There are two statements about the situation which should not attract controversy. One is that, of course, Palestinians have the right to assert and defend their human rights in the face of decades of oppression and occupation. I personally, and the Labour Party, have a long track record of supporting Palestinians' right to self-determination, but the actions of Hamas, in deliberately targeting civilians must be condemned. Israeli citizens have a right to go about their business without fear of attack. The second statement, which is also important and should not be controversial, is that the Israeli Government must be condemned for engaging in collective punishment. It must be condemned for besieging Gaza, targeting civilian infrastructure and breaching international law. These two statements should not attract controversy, and it is a zero-sum game in international politics where they do and where it is thought that one and the other cannot be said together. The reality is that despite the awful conflict deepening and despite the issue being raised so often at an international level, the international community has failed ordinary people in Israel and Gaza and in Palestine generally. Right now, it is impossible to see a situation where matters do not get worse. The Taoiseach knows a diplomatic failure at international level requires a diplomatic response, from us in Ireland as much as at an international level. At an international level, what is Ireland's response to the conflict? How will the Irish Government continue to work, both at EU and UN level? It is important the Government condemns not only the brutality of Hamas but also the siege tactics and breaches of international law being deployed by the Israeli Government. How are we in Ireland working to bring international pressure to bear, as the Taoiseach just said, to calm the situation and to restore the focus on building a two-state solution, a lasting peace settlement in accordance with international law?	spk_87

That is very positive. It would also be very positive to see Ireland taking a strong position on support for Palestinian statehood and for the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill, which the Labour Party was proud to support and help Senator Frances Black to shepherd through Seanad Éireann. There is a need for a unity of purpose on the Palestinian right to self-determination to come forward from this House and this country, while at the same time, as the Taoiseach said, we must be clear about condemning outright the brutality of Hamas that we saw at the weekend. I would also say there is an issue at a domestic or national level, where we have seen a real toxicity in public discourse on social media.

We want to know that if we or our family members get sick or injured, we will be able to access the care we need. We want to know that everyone in our community will have a guarantee of the decent standard of living which should be so achievable in a country like ours, which has resources the envy of so many of our neighbours. However, that is not the reality in the Ireland of 2023. Insecurity is the reality in the lives of far too many people here. Nearly 13,000 people are homeless and nearly 4,000 of those are children. Many more people are in hidden homelessness; they are still couch surfing or sleeping in childhood bedrooms well into late adulthood. One in five workers is still on low pay. Even those with good jobs and their own homes are unable to access decent public services. They face long waiting lists for services for children with autism, disability services and they are unable to find a crèche place or home care services for older relatives. Far too many have fallen victim to the lack of public infrastructure that is endemic here and which has resulted from a free market ideology that is content to rely on  A key test in the long term is whether this budget will provide sustainable supports for families and communities. The short answer is ""No"". People look to the Government for improved public services for the security they and their families need, but when they look at this budget, they see that it gives many a touch, but it will give no one a real helping hand. The Government has delivered more than €14 billion in spending and tax measures, though as my colleague, Deputy Nash, has pointed out, there is more in the tax package than there is in social protection measures. The Government has also failed to address the glaring gaps in public services, the chronic shortage of housing, the lack of childcare places and of autism and disability service provision. As Deputy Nash has said, this budget bribes people with their own money, but ultimately leaves them worse off without the security net of strong public services. Last Thursday, we in the Labour Party published our alternative budget, with an emphasis on building those strong public services. We outlined radical but realistic plans to address the real economic insecurity which is impacting people’s lives. We sought to put an end to the Hibernian paradox of a rich country which is poor at the same time. We are a country running budget surpluses that are the envy of Europe, but with public services that are an embarrassment within Europe. Last week I met a constituent of mine and of the Minister for Transport who is paying €1,200 a month in childcare, which is €300 a week. Her friend in Germany has a crèche fee of €30 per week. Despite this, our constituent considered herself lucky to have a crèche place for her child at all, in a country where childcare and early years education has always been the poor relation within our care system. Our Labour Party plans would have offered real change, not just in childcare where we have a costed package to cap fees at €50 per week and build towards a publicly funded model of childcare, but also in our cost-of-living package which would have supported all households who are feeling the pinch, lifted the boats of those with least and crucially provided for sustainable improvements to public services. Instead of a plan like that, a plan which would have delivered an Ireland that works for all, the Government chose to give a wad of once-off payments with no lasting, sustainable change. On the issues the public are most concerned about - the cost of living, housing, childcare and elder care, healthcare, jobs and climate - the Government lacks ambition. Its budget lacked any mechanism to deliver real change. Nowhere was that more evident than in the lack of provision on housing. I have said it before, but housing is the civil rights issue of this generation in Ireland. It is a workers’ rights issue. Lack of housing is hindering our economic growth and hampering our public services. On that point both ICTU and IBEC agree. Ireland must build at least 50,000 homes a year to address this crisis. We know that and the Taoiseach said earlier that the Housing For All targets are set too low, yet in this budget housebuilding targets remain unchanged. If the Government's financial allocations for next year do not reflect the real, established need, it will have fallen at the first hurdle, because even if its housing plan is implemented in full, it will meet just two thirds of the real need. This lack of ambition and urgency will perpetuate and worsen the housing crisis for years to come. We have all been lectured on how the crisis will not and cannot be fixed overnight, but since Fine Gael entered government, 4,599 nights have passed. That includes 1,202 nights since this Government was formed. How many more are needed? On the Government's current trajectory, there will never be enough. What was needed in yesterday's budget was decisive action on housing, but what we got was just more cosmetic fixes. This was effectively the first Fianna Fáil budget in over a decade, but some things never change. At a time when rents are skyrocketing and rental properties so hard to find, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, announced tax breaks worth €160 million a year for landlords without a shred of evidence this policy will deliver any increase in supply or improved conditions for renters. It is reminiscent of the Government's evidence-free policy on lifting the temporary ban on no-fault evictions earlier this year. This move will not address rising rents or tenancy uncertainty. It is also just wrong. How is it justified to treat the taxation of working people as different from the income generated by landlords? Let us look at it this way: a student renting a bedsit in Rathmines, in the constituency the Minister and I share, will be paying more tax on earnings from his or her part-time job than the landlord will be on the rental income from a house on which the mortgage may well have been paid off, that is to say, a passive asset.It is fundamentally wrong that people paying rent will be paying more tax on income generated from their labour than a landlord will pay on income generated from a fixed asset, and one that is increasing in value. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have caved in to the wrong demands here. All they have offered renters is a measly rent credit that is inaccessible to those whose tenancy is unregistered or who are afraid to engage with their landlord in case they lose their home. On vacancy and dereliction, something we in the Labour Party have been leading on, we have also seen far too little from the Government. Instead of a winter blitz on vacancy and of an emergency empty homes fund like the one we proposed, the Government chose to just offer a minimal increase in the vacant homes tax. What was announced yesterday will be ineffectual in driving the change that we need. The Government has even delayed the residential zoned land tax. Last-minute measures on vacancy are simply inadequate. We need far greater State investment here, especially given the level of vacancy and dereliction in our communities. It is a scourge on our urban centres. I know the Minister, Deputy Ryan, agrees with me on this. We have over 160,000 vacant properties around the country and yet we are going to see another wasted year when we will not have the sort of really significant investment required to tackle the problem. It is not just on vacancy or renters' rights that this budget has failed. In this budget, 10,200 new HAP and RAS tenancies were announced. While the 74,000 existing such tenancies will continue, we have no detail on where these promises are coming from. Again, there are plenty of rhetoric and misleading figures but very little substance. Most surprisingly and disappointingly, there is nothing in the budget to provide for the necessary big push on house building, on supplying the 50,000 new homes that are so badly needed every year. Everyone agrees that what is needed to unlock the housing crisis is the speedier delivery of new homes. The Taoiseach made an extraordinary statement earlier to the effect that the difficulty in housing will be the Government’s capacity to spend the housing budget, as if he is a bystander, but the Government can fix the capacity issue. Where in this budget is the Government's plan to kick-start a massive construction recruitment programme? We in the Labour Party provided for this in our alternative budget but all we see from the Government on this is hand-wringing over a lack of capacity. That is not good enough. The Government's hand-wringing and inaction on the housing disaster affects every facet of Irish society. Ms Phil Ní Sheaghdha of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, said that young nurses and midwives are spending up to three quarters of their monthly income on rent. We cannot fix the HSE while this continues because it is contributing massively to difficulties in recruitment and retention. At the same time, we learn that the HSE is sitting on hundreds of vacant properties which could be renovated to provide accommodation for healthcare workers. One example is the empty hospital in mine and the Minister's own community on Baggot Street. That building is still lying empty. It is a blot on the landscape but it could be used to offer overnight beds to so many people. It is not just the housing disaster that is wrecking the health service. Where is the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly? Where are the measures in this budget on health? There is simply nothing here. We have a huge gap in the health budget. This budget does not allocate enough money for the health service, just like last year's budget. As Deputy Duncan Smith said, there is no real money for new services and no new health initiatives at all. What of the money needed for the national cancer strategy and the funding needed to fully staff our health services? Where is the promised funding to restore pay parity to the community and voluntary sector workers who are about to go on strike next week?"	spk_128
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-10-11	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 4: General (Resumed)	dbsect_18	Section 39, section 10 and section 56 workers have been denied pay parity for far too long. We are going to see a massive impact on the community and voluntary sector and on the people who rely on that sector from next week if this is not resolved. It is a glaring gap in this budget. There are glaring gaps on housing, pay provision and on health, but there are also two other glaring gaps. One is the lack of any overall provision for public sector pay increases. At least €1 billion extra will be needed next year for pay rises. We have accounted for that in our alternative budget but where is it in the Government's budget? The other glaring gap is the failure to increase income supports in line with inflation. If you were poor yesterday, you will still be poor after this budget and we are no closer to meeting the pension promise of a State pension rate equal to 34% of average earnings. This budget provided no permanent increases in the fuel allowance, the living alone allowance or child benefit. It did not provide adequate increases in social protection generally, unlike our alternative budget. It looks likely that we will have to have another spring package of supports when the shine wears off this year’s one-off payments. Most shamefully, this budget includes simply inadequate measures to tackle child poverty. In a country where 90,000 children are living in poverty, we see the poorest parents getting an increase of just €4 per week. On childcare, we see far too little and the changes made are delayed for too long. I have already spoken about the Labour Party's proposal. The Government has been boasting about the so-called 25% cut to fees, but that is delayed until next September and it is an average cut. My party colleague, Senator Marie Sherlock, published examples last night of what the change will really mean. It will not have the impact the Government is claiming it will have on the pockets of parents and the increase in core funding will simply not go far enough to deliver the pay rises called for in the Big Start campaign from SIPTU. There is grave concern too about the education budget more generally, not just in the early years area. As Deputy Ó Riordáin said, we see no reduction to the biggest class sizes in the EU, no restoration of leadership posts, no clarity on a DEIS+ model, and leaving certificate students have been left out, inexplicably, of the free books scheme. On climate, we see failures too. The proposed infrastructure, climate and nature fund aligns with the proposals we have put forward but the conditionality that will be attached to draw down will be crucial to how it will work. The Taoiseach spoke of offshore wind energy as the moonshot for us. He referred to Ardnacrusha and the need to deliver massive State investment in building capacity in renewables but what I am hearing from the stakeholders and those engaged in trying to roll out both onshore and offshore renewables is immense frustration at the foot-dragging and lengthy delays on the part of Government in building the necessary infrastructure in order that we can achieve that moonshot. The private sector is increasingly frustrated by this. There is no answer in this budget to the question of whether we will see the funding to drive State-led investment in and delivery of the offshore wind energy that is so badly needed. We are also seeing a lack of ambition in the context of retrofitting, public transport and cycling measures. Where is the radical plan to increase the use of public transport like Labour’s €9 climate ticket? Where is the massive investment in cycling infrastructure that Senator Rebecca Moynihan and all of us in the Labour Party are calling for? I am out of time, although I have lots more to say. I will conclude by stating that the proposals announced yesterday may provide some short-term relief but they will not address the long-term insecurities faced today and into the future by so many families and households across our country. In truth, the budget will perpetuate insecurity and inequality. It will not deliver an Ireland that works for all. It is failing and will fail on housing, care, work and climate. It will leave too many public services unfunded, too many homes unbuilt and it will leave too many people behind.	spk_130

It is why we are seeing students marching today with the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, and calling for an increase in student accommodation. It is why we are all hearing from employers who cannot recruit staff, schools that have teacher shortages and hospitals that cannot retain healthcare workers. This is because of the housing crisis across the country. Yet in this housing crisis, the Government has allowed a culture to embed in our urban centres whereby we see the blight and scourge of dereliction and vacancy taking hold and becoming embedded. The Government is not doing enough to address this. In some cases, the State is even contributing to dereliction and vacancy. This week we saw an investigation by Ferghal Blaney of the In Dublin Bay South, the Labour Party has been seeking to bring Baggot Street hospital back into use but we have received very little by way of positive engagement on this issue from the HSE. The sort of obfuscation we have got from the HSE shows a contempt for elected representatives and it is an affront to everybody affected by the housing crisis. How does the Government propose to address the vacancy and dereliction issue, which should be one key way to address the housing crisis? Our national government should be leading from the front on this aspect. What is the scale of the vacancy and dereliction problem in the property portfolios of State Departments and public bodies? Will the Government introduce a more co-ordinated push on vacancy and on bringing buildings back into use as housing for students, nurses and others who are so desperate for housing? Will the Taoiseach introduce this from central government?	spk_82

Clearly, however, what is holding back the creation of jobs here now is the lack of availability of housing. It is holding back delivery of our public services, like education and healthcare, and is holding back our students who are trying to find somewhere close to their places of study where they can live in security. They cannot find it, and this is why they are marching today. Addressing vacancy and dereliction, particularly in public-owned buildings, should be the low-hanging fruit to be tackled and one way to address the housing crisis we are currently facing. Last night, I hosted a public meeting in Rathmines with architect Duncan Stewart and local Labour Party representatives. People there had travelled from all over Dublin because they felt so passionately about the need to see concerted Government action to tackle the scourge of vacancy and dereliction across their communities. I say this because we are seeing it in every urban centre. What we are not seeing is sufficient urgency and ambition from the Government to tackle this issue. The Taoiseach has given a few positive local examples, and these are welcome, of where buildings are being brought back into use. I am aware efforts are under way in Dublin City Council to do the same. What we are lacking, however, is a concerted, central campaign from central government to bring State-owned properties back into use for accommodation for students, nurses and workers-----	spk_86

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-09-27	dail	33	Eviction Ban Bill 2022: Motion	dbsect_7	I thank Deputy Bríd Smith and her colleagues for tabling this motion, which I am glad to support on behalf of the Labour Party. I echo the words of Deputy Ó Broin in pointing out to the Government that, unfortunately, this is another example of a cynical procedural manoeuvre that we are seeing used all too often to delay and effectively neuter Opposition Bills by pushing them off, putting them into lengthy processes and delaying their Second Readings for 12 months and so on. As such, this motion is a sensible move to try to get around that procedural manoeuvre. The manoeuvre is usually used to delay Opposition Bills the Government supports. This is a slightly unusual situation, though, as the Government inadvertently did not oppose the Bill. That is all the more reason to use this motion to ensure the Bill makes progress, given its importance. Shelter is among the most of basic human needs and human rights, yet thousands of people in this country are deprived of a safe and secure home. Many more are in insecure housing, with adults still living in childhood bedrooms, couch surfing or paying exorbitant rents. I have just come from a meeting where, as often happens, an individual took me aside and told me about a personal difficulty in accessing rental accommodation. This individual was in a good and well-paying job but was unable to find affordable accommodation to rent in Dublin city. I hear this constantly from my constituents and from people around the country. The Government has failed the 12,847 people who are homeless, including almost 4,000 children. Each of these has an individual story of homelessness and the deep human trauma that results from that. These are the people living in State homelessness services, but we know there are many more. The Government justifies the shameful decision to lift the temporary no-fault eviction ban on the basis it was not working and homelessness was continuing to rise with the ban in place, but we were told during the ban's duration that it was working in keeping the numbers from rising further. Since the ban was lifted, we have seen those numbers increase, just as we predicted. None of us takes any pleasure in the fact our predictions have materialised. The same predictions were made by NGOs and front-line workers in homelessness services. Despite that, the Government proceeded. It did so without any evidence basis. The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, may be aware I received a reply to a parliamentary question at around the time the ban was to be lifted that revealed that a five-month seasonal weather forecast was the sole evidential consideration underpinning the decision to lift the ban. The decision was made on the basis the winter had seasonally come to an end. There was no attempt to measure the impact of the ban or to assess whether its lifting would lead to the increase in homelessness that has since occurred. No meaningful contingencies were put in place either despite Government policies. Some of the policies the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage announced in March to justify the ban's lifting have still not come into effect. Many of us in opposition have been trying on behalf of constituents to see how schemes like the tenant  The Labour Party made a constructive suggestion to enable an evidence basis for the continuance of the ban at least until homelessness rates had reduced for four consecutive months. It was a reasonable proposal but one the Taoiseach stated he, unfortunately, could not accept. Government figures have made it clear there is no intention even to examine the idea of an evidence basis for resuming the temporary no-fault ban. Some comments from members of the Government have revealed they do not understand what a no-fault eviction ban is or that they believe it is somehow an outlandish measure that should only be seen as an emergency one-off. The reality is that, far from being outlandish or radical and with the tentative Government support we saw, restrictions on no-fault evictions are the norm in comparable European countries. We should be learning from other countries. In Finland, for example, homelessness has fallen sharply following the introduction of a housing first policy, whereby people living in homelessness receive shelter and counselling with no preconditions and four in every five people make their way back into stable living and to having safe and secure homes of their own. Such a programme provides people with dignity and a fair start and is an investment in society. Given we have such a crisis in supply and affordability, we need to see such measures being adopted alongside an eviction ban until supply increases. We all agree supply has to increase. That is the real answer, but when we in opposition make constructive proposals calling on the Government to increase the supply of housing and act with greater urgency and ambition, we are met with derision and dismissal from the Government benches. That is unacceptable. Like many others, I attended briefings this morning from IBEC and Chambers Ireland. I will attend a Focus Ireland event shortly. What we are hearing from employer bodies, business organisations, homelessness organisations and civil society groups is that housing supply needs to increase, the Government needs to take radical, urgent and ambitious measures to increase housing supply, and its targets for delivery are still too low. Boasting about achieving 30,000 new builds per year when we know the real level of need is closer to 50,000 is not good enough. The knock-on effect of this on the rental sector has meant an increase in evictions and homelessness. Turning to international comparators, let us take our nearest neighbour, Britain. Extraordinarily, the secretary of state with responsibility for housing, Mr. Michael Gove, who is hardly a socialist ideologue, has now recognised the need to tackle the blight of no-fault evictions. As such, even senior members of the Tory party are considering measures like this. Our Government should be doing the same. Unfortunately, it has again taken a dismissive approach towards constructive Opposition proposals. I wish to mention the Labour Party's Housing (Homeless Families) Bill 2017 on prioritising the rights of children in homelessness. The Bill has been pushed, promoted and endorsed by Focus Ireland, but the Government has stalled and dismissed it. It has dismissed our renter's rights Bill and the Bill Deputy Bríd Smith and her colleagues introduced. This tactic of dismissing and delaying has become the Government's 	spk_39

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-09-27	dail	33	Gas (Amendment) Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_15	As others said, this Bill is largely technical, and its provisions to integrate Ervia into Gas Networks Ireland make sense. Since Irish Water was separated from Ervia and Uisce Éireann was created at the beginning of this year, Ervia and Gas Networks Ireland have effectively been functioning as one company anyway. This legislation could therefore be described as cleaning things up, to use that expression, or at least cleaning up the corporate structure. It is a measure that can be seen as largely technical. Despite the lack of direct policy implications contained in this Bill, there are a number of points to be made specific to its provisions. I want to turn to those before speaking a little more about the context in which we are debating this Bill. First, I am glad to see that the terms and conditions for employees will be unaffected by the transfer that is to take place. Whenever there is any sort of corporate restructuring or merger of this sort, the worker must be a foremost consideration in the minds of decision-makers. For us in the Labour Party, as the party of the trade union movement, that is absolutely the case. It is vital that things like pay, pensions and workers' rights more generally are protected, and transitions of this sort must be seamless. That the Bill makes specific provision to ensure workers’ remuneration and superannuation are protected is also a welcome step. Superannuation in particular, as we are all aware, is a real issue for many other workers in different State and semi-State bodies and the private sector, many of whom have contacted my office when less careful consolidations have taken place. I have some concerns about the constitution of the board of directors of Gas Networks Ireland. When Uisce Éireann was created, we in the Labour Party were pleased to see that provisions were made for a representative of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, to sit on its board. I am left wondering why the same provision has been excluded from this Bill. It is vital that in State-owned and State-run companies workers have a say in the management of the organisation, and it is the responsibility of the State to set a standard for employment rights, pay, conditions and so on, and to be a best-practice or model employer. Just yesterday, on Leaders’ Questions, I raised the consequences of an abdication of duty in that regard when it comes to the near-collapse of Government-funded care services that are run by the community and voluntary sector. The Taoiseach effectively washed his hands and suggested there was no direct State responsibility to ensure pay parity between section 39 workers in the community and voluntary sector, and workers employed by the HSE and Tusla, who are delivering the same services. As I said, we believe it is an abdication of duty with what may well be very severe and serious implications for service users, and those dependent on care services provided by these workers, if it comes to withdrawal of labour next month. We hope it will not come to that. Gas Networks Ireland will be a public utility and it is our belief that union representation in such a utility represents more than worker representation. It is also about representing the public interest. It is in the public interest to ensure the protection of the position of trade unions, and to ensure that trade union rights are advanced as communal rights, as well as individual workers' rights. That acknowledgement must first come from the State. Giving workers a say in the day-to-day affairs of the company would have been a more progressive step, so it is disappointing that union representation was omitted. I know that board appointments will be made by the majority-shareholding Minister, that is, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien. We would have preferred for the Public Appointments Service to be utilised for appointments to the board but given that is apparently not the case, I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that unions, and therefore workers by proxy and also the public interest, are represented on the board. We would like to hear assurances on that. Otherwise, we may submit an amendment on this, and this may well be raised during debates on Committee and Report Stages. Before turning my attention to the broader topic of our energy gas networks, I would like to make one final point about the Bill's provisions specifically. I note that the board, in consultation with the majority-shareholding Minister, will appoint a statutory auditor. As a State utility, Gas Networks Ireland will be in receipt of a significant amount of public investment and taxpayers’ money. Given that this is the case, the company should be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. I would be grateful if this point could be addressed during the course of the debate. I will now turn to the broader context of our energy infrastructure. We all acknowledge that a very important part of the rationale for separating the operational management of our gas infrastructure from that of our water infrastructure is to help us meet the challenge of decarbonising our energy supply. That is a really laudable aim and, of course, in the Labour Party we strongly support and encourage that aim. The consequences of doing otherwise are appalling in the face of an existential climate crisis, and we are all very aware of that. The consequences are also very practically felt in other countries. We saw in the news this week that a case has been taken by six Portuguese young people in the European Court of Human Rights, who argue that the Government has breached their human rights by failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Like the climate case we have seen here, we will see more such litigation. Unfortunately, there have been far too many delays and missed targets in meeting our binding climate and emissions reduction targets. I am glad, even in a technical Bill, that we see a small step towards decarbonisation inherent to and underlying it. The reality is that Gas Networks Ireland must play a crucial role in our transition towards renewables, and towards a carbon-neutral energy infrastructure and a broader green economy and society. Ireland’s gas network is more than 14,500 km long. It supplies more than 30% of our total energy, including 40% of our heat and almost 50% of our electricity. We have debated in this House already the huge burden that is imposed on our electricity infrastructure by data centres, and that is certainly an issue we have raised in the past, as have other opposition parties. It is a real concern. Just imagine the difference we could make in meeting our vital climate targets if we can decarbonise the network. It would be truly transformative. To achieve this, however, we need to see significantly scaling up of our investment in green solutions, and in renewable gas sources like biomethane or hydrogen, for example. It is incumbent on us all to see the creation of a sustainable, renewable gas industry in Ireland and the State must take the lead. We know that we have the resources to do this and the infrastructure can be there too.Biomethane, for example, is fully compatible with our current gas networks and, indeed, Gas Networks Ireland has been supplying small quantities of biomethane gas for a few years now. More broadly, this would also bring significant benefit to our rural and farming communities. We often hear a perception that there is anxiety within groups such as farmers around climate action measures. Certain actors would have farming communities believe that the green transition is something to be feared. We know that is not the case and, in fact, the future for farming is through sustainable methods. We have seen wonderful examples of that across the country, such as projects in the Burren and the Blackwater Valley in Cork. Change in the way we farm may be required but there are enormous opportunities and benefits for farming communities there as well. This is one of those benefits. There is massive potential to create a thriving income source for farmers in selling biomethane produced in the anaerobic digestion process not to mention some of the byproducts, such as the sale of crops fed into the process and the biofertiliser digestate that is produced. There is not only one example. There is a plethora of opportunities to decarbonise our energy supply and provide benefits to rural and farming communities. This sort of benefit is essential to ensuring we have a just transition. For families and households squeezed by the cost-of-living crisis, it is particularly galling to see energy companies making record profits. It is unsupportable that people are facing increased energy costs and fees for energy services when energy companies are making record profits. There has been a slowness and delay in energy companies meeting renewable targets. We are not seeing the political will to grasp the nettle and take the radical action required to address the climate emergency. While this technical Bill is welcome, we want to take the opportunity to point out the need to do a great deal more. Others have spoken about something I have spoken about many times in this House, that is, the considerable potential for the development of offshore wind in Ireland. There have been delays in the scaling up of infrastructure necessary to develop that potential source of renewable energy. I hear from stakeholders in offshore wind production who are deeply frustrated at delays in enabling the roll-out of offshore wind production. We need to see far greater energy devoted to the development of that source of energy. In the context of this Bill, Gas Networks Ireland has a vital role to play in our decarbonisation efforts but we need to see it equipped to scale up our transition from non-renewable, carbon-intensive gas sources to greener, renewable sources. The infrastructure may be there but the resources and mandate, as well as the ambition and delivery, are necessary from the Government.	spk_154
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-09-27	dail	33	Historic and Archaeological Heritage and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2023: Report and Final Stages	dbsect_18	"I will come in on this group of amendments. As Deputy Ó Snodaigh has said, these relate, for the most part, to definitional issues in the Bill. It is important in such an important overhaul of the National Monuments Acts that we would see clarity of definitions. Government amendment No. 6 in this group provides a more contextual definition of ""amenity"". I welcome that. It is similar, in many ways, to our amendment No. 28 in the next group, which would include reference to ""landscape"". We need that broader understanding of cultural heritage. We in the Labour Party are keen to support the Bill although we want to ensure it has clarity of definitions throughout and can be amended to enable the reflection of international standards to ensure the highest possible protection of our heritage. As my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, said on Second Stage, we have a chequered history of heritage protection. I am thinking of sites such as Wood Quay, which was shamefully destroyed. I am thinking too of Iveagh Markets, close to my own area, on which issue I was glad to see the Minister of State's intervention. I am also thinking of Rathmines town hall about which the Minister of State and I have spoken before. It is important that we relate back to the original vision of our now President Michael D. Higgins on his introduction of the Heritage Act in the 1990s, which was to ensure that we have updated definitions and real clarity around what we are protecting, and to ensure the highest possible level of protection. While we are protecting amenities, monuments and things, we must, as the Minister of State said, include the setting of the monument. Our amendment No. 28 intends to ensure we are also protecting landscapes and ensuring the landscape itself can be understood as requiring protection. Too often in the past, we have seen monuments as discrete entities in the landscape rather than understanding that the landscape itself is a hugely important part of our heritage. I support Deputy Ó Snodaigh's attempts to ensure there is clarity of definition and that we have the broadest possible protection of our heritage in this group of amendments."	spk_202
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-09-27	dail	33	Historic and Archaeological Heritage and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2023: Report and Final Stages	dbsect_18	I am conscious that we are speaking to the grouping of amendments. Amendment No. 38, tabled by the Labour Party, is in keeping with the spirit of the other amendments, which seek to ensure maximum protection for heritage. The general object of the Bill is to update the National Monuments Acts and ensure strong protections for historic and archaeological heritage. Amendment No. 38, in particular, seeks to ensure there is public access to national monuments and other historic heritage sites. Whatever protections are put in place in the Bill, the public value thereof is limited if the monuments and sites are not accessible to members of the public. If they are kept hidden from public access and view, there is a question over the extent to which people can experience their own heritage. We are conscious that public access can bring its own problems, including the need to safeguard monuments, landscapes and sites from excessive interference and possible damage. There are also legitimate concerns among private landowners. Through amendment No. 38, we are seeking to ensure the principle that reasonable public access is a public good is enshrined in law and that there could be detailed regulatory provision regarding how competing interests would be reconciled and how this public good would be best protected. The key point we wish to ensure is that the statement of principle is there and that section 3(1) would also provide that a person performing a function under the Act would recognise and take due account of principles, to include that historic heritage is a non-renewable resource of great cultural and scientific importance and that there would be a presumption in favour of the protection  Colleagues have spoken about historic sites in their areas. I recently visited Castletown House in Celbridge with the local Labour Party councillor, Angela Feeney, who has been very active in the campaign to preserve access to the house. It is a magnificent site of national heritage and there should be no restriction of access to allow people to enjoy it. Local people told me how much of a lifeline it was to them during Covid in particular. The idea that access would be restricted is unacceptable to the local community. We need a provision in the Bill such as that proposed in amendment No. 38 to ensure this principle is respected and there is a duty and responsibility placed at all levels of governance to recognise that not just the preservation of national monuments and heritage sites, but also access to them, is a public good. That is the essence of the amendment. The other amendments in the grouping are in keeping with the spirit of the principle we are seeking to secure.	spk_266

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-09-26	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I welcome the Taoiseach back. My question to him today is who cares for the carers. We in the Labour Party are not sure that his Government appreciates the crisis in care. A protest is currently taking place outside the Dáil by childcare and early years education providers. We all hear all the time from parents, staff and workers in the childcare sector who are being failed. Parents cannot access affordable childcare for their children, staff cannot afford to live on the wages in the sector and children are being failed by this. It is not only a crisis in childcare. Yesterday, Fórsa, SIPTU and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, which represent 5,000 staff in the community and voluntary care sector, all balloted for indefinite strike action from 17 October. Withdrawing labour is no easy decision. It is a last resort, but what other option do workers in this sector have? These are workers who provide a lifeline to Ireland's most vulnerable communities, caring for our homeless, providing disability services and providing support for older people, and they provide these essential services on behalf of the State, on behalf of the Government, yet it has washed its hands of responsibility for them. It is almost one year since this House debated a Labour Party motion to fund pay rises for workers in section 39 organisations and others in the community and voluntary sector. The Government allowed the motion to pass. It did not oppose it but has done nothing since. Now, creaking services are being held together by staff who are facing another winter of spiralling housing costs with wages that have stagnated. One worker from a section 39 organisation stated that serving and supporting the most vulnerable people in our society makes them very proud but that the Government offer compromises the future of organisations like the one they work in:Staff turnover is high. Nurses and care staff are leaving every day for better care and conditions in section 38 areas ... is a bitter pill to swallow in the current cost-of-living crisis. Rising inflation, increased interest rates and rising childcare costs are crippling.That is one person's testimony, but it represents the experience of many in the sector. Services are suffering as a result. Disability and homelessness services are near collapse. Almost 3,000 people have been forced into emergency accommodation due the Government's failed housing policy. The United Nations has criticised Ireland for potential violations in disability services. Yesterday, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, confirmed that 3,600 sexual offences were reported in the year to this spring. These are official statistics. They understate the scale of the problems. Every family is in some way reliant on the care of community and voluntary workers, yet current Government policy is that the value of workers who support people in homelessness and disability services and through rape crisis and domestic violence, if they work for section 10, 39 or 56 organisations, is somehow less than the value of the equivalent workers who are employed directly by the State to provide the same services. Playing chicken with community and voluntary workers in the way the Government has done is irresponsible, verging on reckless. My question about these heroic workers who have had no pay rise since 2008 is whether the Government will accept their demands for pay parity and will it apply future public pay sector agreements to community and voluntary service workers? Will it take action on the request in the Labour Party motion that was passed exactly one year ago?	spk_8

The State is the funder, as the Taoiseach himself has acknowledged. We are simply asking for that recognition and acknowledgment to translate, in a practical sense, to a decent offer of pay and conditions for the workers who are impacted and for the service users who will be impacted. As I have said, we in the Labour Party have consistently raised this issue over many months. My colleague Deputy Duncan Smith raised it in the first weeks following the Dáil's resumption last year. We also brought forward a motion last year. The Government's support for that motion recognises the need to move on this and yet the offer is derisory. It is below the rate of inflation. These are workers who love their jobs. We all know people who work in these services. They care deeply for service users but they are being forced out of the sector in search of better pay and conditions elsewhere. Will the Taoiseach grasp the nettle in advance of 17 October?	spk_12

The Taoiseach's response to me will give little reassurance to those parents who are relying on services provided by Enable Ireland and to those relying on services provided by organisations that provide such vital services to so many across the country. All he said in response to me was that Tusla and the HSE are preparing to make contingencies. That has the sound of a let-them-eat-cake approach to a collapsing care system and is simply not good enough. I did not hear from the Taoiseach an indication of engagement to ensure that the action will not go ahead on 17 October. We need to debate in this House with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and Ministers who are directly responsible for the provision of these services. We need to have a debate on this so that we can ensure that the action will not go ahead on 17 October and that pay parity will be restored because it is such a vital issue and it cuts across so many areas. When we say the community and voluntary sector, it sometimes sounds like a vague thing, but these are people providing services on the ground in all our communities. 	spk_38

We hear from many parents about the shortage of places nationwide, expensive fees and providers closing their doors. I have a constituent who is still waiting to hear from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth about whether a mechanism even exists to deal with her complaint of a failure to freeze fees by her crèche. We in the Labour Party acknowledge and support progress being made towards greater State investment in childcare but it is too slow. We are very concerned about the lack of progress on the promised further reduction in fees for parents. Last month, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, confirmed that parents cannot expect the promised 25% further reduction. Today, on ""Morning Ireland"", he did not say one way or the other whether that reduction would happen. There is still time for the Government to make a positive U-turn on a reduction of fees for parents.

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-09-21	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_32	"The Minister wants to deal with facts. This month marks two years since the launch of his Housing for All programme. In all the facts and on all the objective metrics, Housing for All is failing. It is failing in ambition and delivery. The Minister has said himself that the Government needs to catch up on housing delivery. That is evident but it also needs to upgrade its targets. As our housing disaster deepens, it is becoming clear that Housing for All or ""Housing for Some, as it might more appropriately be called, has failed. It is failing partly because the targets are too low. The Minister knows from his own figures that, with a growing population, the target should be closer to 50,000 new builds per year, not the 29,000 or 30,000 level at which new builds are flatlining. An economic analysis for the Labour Party also shows that we need to see significant additional capital investment in housing delivery of at least €1 billion this year. I do not know if the Minister can accept that. We also know there is a need to deliver an ambitious recruitment programme to ensure we have enough skilled labour to deliver housing. The Minister and his Government colleagues always refer to shortages in labour supply but we need to see some ambition and the delivery of increased recruitment in the construction trades, increased recruitment campaigns and better pay and conditions for apprenticeships, with a beefed up apprenticeship programme as well. Otherwise, the Minister's plan is incapable of delivering the real need. To deal again with facts, two years on, house prices have skyrocketed, rents are spiralling and each month we are seeing, unfortunately, record-breaking homelessness figures. Homelessness is now at 12,847 individuals, each with his or her own story of distress and of being out of a home. House prices have increased by nearly 20% since September 2021. Rents are up 21%. All the key indicators are showing failure on the Housing for All programme, both in ambition and on delivery. It is just not good enough. We are seeing people and families being failed. Every family and community affected by the housing disaster, every individual young or old, knows that it is impacting upon them and on their communities. Let us take the shameful lifting of the temporary ban on no-fault evictions, which the Government lifted in March without any clear evidence basis. The Minister's party leader, the Tánaiste, asserted that the Labour Party's proposal to keep the ban in place until homelessness figures had been shown to have fallen would exacerbate the situation. The Minister's own policy has exacerbated the situation. Official homelessness figures have risen by another 11% since March. There are now 3,873 children in homelessness, doing their homework on hotel floors and unable to bring friends home on play dates. That is a shocking and unacceptable situation in 2023. Will the Minister take ownership of his decision to lift the ban and will he reinstitute it for this year? Does he accept that Housing for All has failed on ambition and in delivery? Will he adopt more ambitious targets and a more ambitious programme that would really deliver for the communities that so desperately need new homes?"	spk_224

We have seen seven wasted years of prosperity since 2016 and we have seen a failure by successive Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil governments to deliver the homes people need.

As a former Minister with responsibility for housing, how can the Minister justify the lack of Government action on protection for renters? At a minimum, today's report shows renters must be empowered and provided with information about their homes so they can know their rights. If the Government had supported the Labour Party's renters' rights Bill back in 2021 we would have a rent register in place, along with other measures to protect tenants, protect renters and give greater security.

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-09-20	dail	33	Local Government (Mayor of Limerick) Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_18	We in the Labour Party welcome the opportunity to debate this Bill. In particular, I thank the local Labour Party organisation in Limerick for its input on the Bill, especially my colleagues in Limerick, councillors Conor Sheehan, Elena Secas and Joe Leddin, who have provided me with a very important input and observations on this topic. As the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, will be well aware, the Labour Party has a long history and a proud tradition in Limerick. I think of our wonderful former representatives such as Jan O'Sullivan, who remains very actively engaged in local politics, and the late Jim Kemmy, who had such a powerful influence on national and local politics. I want to speak broadly in support of the principle of directly elected mayors and to welcome the fact that the Bill will finally bring that about, albeit very late in the day and just in respect of one city, namely, Limerick. What we should be seeing, which is long overdue, is a more comprehensive system of the reform of local government to ensure real and substantial devolution or decentralisation of power to local government. I think in particular of Dublin, our capital city. I know a great deal of work has been done in the citizens' assembly and so on, but we do need to see more swift movement towards a directly elected mayor for Dublin. My constituency colleague, Councillor Dermot Lacey, has long been a very powerful advocate for a directly elected mayor for Dublin. We are all aware that much of our system of local government remains largely unchanged from the 19th century. It remains very centralised and very much based on an outdated British model of governance. It is ironic, therefore, that in Britain we have seen cities such as London, Manchester and Liverpool move towards much greater devolution of power to a directly elected metropolitan mayor. This time last year I attended the British Labour Party conference in Liverpool. While there, I caught up with Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester. There is an example of a mayor who has really used the role of metropolitan mayor of Manchester to become a very influential advocate for regional development. His work has led to great improvements, not only in his own city, but is more generally seen as a model for other cities and urban areas. That system of devolved power, which includes mayors like Sadiq Khan in London, contrasts starkly with the very disempowered position of mayor here in Ireland. Currently, mayors such as the Dublin mayor, remain largely ceremonial roles, with only a one-year mandate, and they are not directly elected. That has led to a democratic deficit and a lack of co-ordinated thinking across our urban centres. Dynamic cities like Dublin, but also Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick, are hampered in competing on an international stage with other cities. We all acknowledge that the lack of a more substantial position of metropolitan mayor has contributed to that. We do need to see local government in Ireland brought more into line with local governments in other jurisdictions where we have got really meaningful systems of accountability across local authorities with elected representatives responsible for the implementation of policies that make a difference in people's lives such as on education, local healthcare and so on. It is unfortunate that currently councillors have such few and limited powers. We believe that this Bill should be the start of a process where we see wider reform of local government and proper rebalancing of powers between councillors and their executive, with expanded reserved powers for councillors. It would appear that there is still some reticence from the Custom House to accede to that rebalancing that is really so necessary to ensure proper accountability. This is not about placing power in the hands of councillors for its own sake; this is about democratic accountability and elected representatives who are accountable to residents in local areas who vote for them. It is about democracy at its most local level. Before turning to the Bill itself, I want to speak about the current state of play as it relates to the balance of powers between the mayor and executive in local authorities. As we are all aware, at present responsibilities at council level are divided into two areas: reserved functions for elected councillors and executive functions that are essentially in the hands of the chief executive, who in reality has become an all-powerful figure in all local authorities. Broadly speaking, policy decisions are still made by resolutions of the elected councillors. Reserved functions include the passing of annual budgets, housing policy decisions, making development plans and policies on environmental protection. In reality, the duty of the chief executive to perform executive functions and to advise and assist the elected council has assumed much greater significance than it perhaps looks on paper. The chair of the council, the mayor or cathaoirleach, elected by councillors, has functions in relation to chairing plenary meetings and strategic policy committees but the primary function remains somewhat ceremonial in most councils. This Bill attempts to carve out a role for the mayor, which it seems will lie somewhere between the elected council and the chief executive. It is a new division of responsibility.When the general scheme was first drafted, it was very much in general terms and it was not clear what territory between the elected council's policy function and the decision-making function of the chief executive, now to be the director general, would be marked out for the mayor to occupy. The Bill, while it differs from the general scheme, seems to attempt to achieve the same objective, but there is still a lack of clarity as to what precisely that territory will be for the directly elected mayor. That is the critical point. As Conor Sheehan, our councillor in Limerick, pointed out in an editorial on this topic last year the concern is that under legislation which does not provide a real and substantive role for a directly elected mayor, the directly elected mayor could amount to little more than a well-remunerated chauffeured lobbyist. That is the concern. The Minister will appreciate that.  The Bill replaces the mayor, CEO and cathaoirleach with a directly elected mayor, which is the biggest new change. We will also see the replacement of a CEO with the director general and a new chair, called a príomh chomhairleoir, to be elected by the council. Presumably, relations between this new first councillor and the mayor will depend on electoral outcomes and party political considerations. One could envisage somewhat of a power battle might go on in practice. The directly elected mayor would attend, speak and vote at council meetings, and attend and speak at district meetings. Questions to the mayor can be tabled in that way. The mayor would inherit some functions of what is currently the cathaoirleach, apart from presiding at plenary meetings and chairing the corporate policy group. The mayor will also inherit all functions of the previous CEO, apart from the Schedule list. Of course, that is critical.  The mayor could, it seems, delegate in writing the performance of some functions to the director general and delegated functions would then be performed by the director general, subject to the general superintendence and control of the mayor and any conditions or restrictions in writing. Instead of a broadly phrased exemption covering, for example, the administration of schemes, grants and loans, as in the general scheme, the Bill has a Schedule of specific sections of particular Acts where functions are confirmed that will remain with the director general. Broadly, it seems to us that the exclusions relate to housing, planning and waste.  Internal financial borrowing and banking functions, account keeping and responsibility for staffing matters will also be excluded from the mayor's remit. For example, it would remain the function of the director general to act as housing authority regarding all housing services, including social and affordable housing, shared ownership, grants, subsidies, loans, homelessness, management and the control of local authority housing. That is still a very broad range of functions for the director general. It seems the council will continue to elect its own chair and the new mayor, as I have said, will attend, vote and be subject to the policy remit of the council. When we look at the detail of this, it seems that the council will, in effect, have two executive offices. The Minister of State may have a view and like to come back on that. The boundary between those two offices, just like the boundaries between the new directly elected mayor and the councillors, may depend on how things bed down in practice. Again, it is hard to see clarity on how this will roll out.  In particular, the boundary between the two executive officers will depend on a case-by-case scrutiny of the 200 or so references in the Schedule to functions that have not transferred and will, therefore, remain with the director general. In summary, it is difficult to see how this will work in practice. There is perhaps a lack of detail. I accept some detail will have to be worked out. This is the first directly elected mayor of its kind, but the territory for the directly elected mayor will be difficult to map out for that person, whoever is elected. The person will have two people snapping at their heels, namely the CEO, now to be the director general, and those staff on the one hand and on the other the directly elected councillors and their indirectly elected cathaoirleach or first counsellor, as the person will now be called. Our concerns, therefore, are first about how this new directly elected mayor will map out the territory between these two different entities. It will be difficult for that individual.  We are concerned that the Bill cannot be said to have taken on board the substance of much of the recommendations that were made in response to the general scheme. We accept that there are some measures, such as the establishment of a mayoral and government consultative forum and the provision for a mayoral programme that will be equivalent to a programme for Government, which are welcome. We welcome the advisory and implementation committee. Of course, Limerick will have its Project Ireland 2040 delivery board, including a transport subgroup. However, there is a lack of clarity on the terms of reference of the delivery board.  It seems that the Government has failed to incorporate the additional powers recommended by the implementation advisory group, IAG. It seems that the Bill is much more focused on running the election and more technical details around the election of the mayor, amendments to existing legislation to account for the mayor and other administrative changes in proposals. As I said, we would like to hear from the Minister of State about the substantive powers to be attributed to the new directly elected mayor and the reasons why recommendations from the IAG, councillors and civil society have not been implemented more fully.  I have been asked to seek clarification on the Government's thinking of the timing of the mayoral elections. Various local groups have sought information on the rationale for not holding the local and mayoral elections as a stand-alone separate events. What is the thinking around putting them together?  I am conscious that a lot of the detailed debate will have to take place on Committee and Report Stages because there is so little in the Bill on the mayor's powers that it is hard to give robust feedback. We would like to hear from the Minister of State about issues such as staffing. Will the new mayor be able to appoint his or her own staff, apart from the special adviser that is provided for, or will staff be assigned? That information would be very important in practice for the functioning of the mayor.  Does the Minister of State envisage problems where there is conflict, such as where the annual budget prepared by the director general will not reflect the priorities of the directly elected mayor? How will that be worked out? Again, the Minister of State might like to address that. Without greater powers over the budget, will we see the same lack of direction that already tends to exist at local authority level? What role will other organisations have, in addition to Limerick City and County Council, in making representations to the Limerick mayoral and government consultative forum? Of course, it does not need to be said, but I should have said at the outset that Limerick is rich with wonderful civil society and business and workers' organisations. I thank Limerick Chamber of Commerce and the Limerick Council of Trade Unions, with which I have engaged, because there is a huge wealth of knowledge, expertise and experience among the members of those bodies and so many more. Given that we have waited so long for this Bill, why the silence on the powers? Why the significant divergence from what was recommended by the IAG? Limerick Chamber of Commerce and others have raised these concerns. We will reserve the right to bring forward amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage, but we look forward to the response of the Minister of State on Second Stage. When people in Limerick voted to take back control and ensure a more closely democratically elected civic leader for their city, they did not vote for ambiguity or half measures. At the most basic level, they voted for a meaningful office and directly elected mayor who would have real power to implement change and an office that would take back power that national government has accumulated over many years, harking back to the old British model of centralised governance.  We are concerned that the Custom House appears unwilling to cede substantive power and influence to the directly elected mayor, yet the people of Limerick were promised the ability and resources to deliver their local services and infrastructure. We are concerned that the current proposals do not give the directly elected mayor sufficient power to do this. A failure to fulfil the expectation that people now have in Limerick would amount to a kind of disrespect to the people who voted in good faith to have a directly elected mayor.Let us not forget that vote, and I know the Minister of State will not forget this, was in 2019 so people in Limerick might well have expected to see the implementation of that vote sooner. It is unfortunate that it has taken so long.  I reiterate that we would like to see a package of reforms so that this would only be the first step in a series of reforms to give directly elected councillors more meaningful power. I make a particular appeal for the city of Dublin in which my constituency lies. Our capital city should also have the sort of metropolitan mayor we have seen rolled out so successfully in our neighbouring jurisdiction of Great Britain. I hope we will see Limerick become a good litmus test and a good model for other cities in Ireland to follow.	spk_124
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-07-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ar Pholasaí nó ar Reachtaíocht - Questions on Policy or Legislation	dbsect_31	I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his staff and all the wonderful staff here in Leinster House for all the immense work everyone does in keeping the House running smoothly. I wish everyone well as we approach the recess. In December I was honoured to present the recommendations of the Oireachtas Committee on Gender Equality in my capacity as Cathaoirleach of that committee. We endorsed the Citizens' Assembly recommendation to hold a referendum to amend the Constitution to require greater constitutional recognition for the principles of equality and gender equality in particular, to remove sexist language referring to women and mothers in particular as having lives and duties in the home, to introduce meaningful recognition of the value and role of care and of course to create a more inclusive definition of families. On 8 March, International Women's Day, the Taoiseach announced the referendum would be held this November. Our committee had produced a unanimously agreed wording that could be put to the people. We have heard nothing since then as to when the referendum will be held. I submitted a parliamentary question last week asking the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, whether the referendum would be held in November and I got a very disappointing reply yesterday saying an interdepartmental group has been established, it has been working on policy proposals which will be brought forward for consideration and decision by Government and that the Department will be in a position to update further at that stage. When will the referendum be held? Will it be held in November? It has been delayed so many times. We have been criticised internationally for continuing to have sexist language in the Constitution. We need a more inclusive definition of family and we need to see care valued and recognised in our Constitution. When will it happen?	spk_220

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-07-13	dail	33	Dereliction and Building Regeneration Bill 2022: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_42	"I will keep my comments briefer then. I commend Deputy Matthews on bringing forward this Bill. I am delighted to support it on behalf of the Labour Party. As Deputy Matthews says, it is an honour to be able to bring forward Private Members' legislation in this House. It is something many of us have felt inspired in doing. I want to acknowledge that. I also commend him on his vision of a more streamlined process to tackle dereliction and vacancy. All of us are in favour of that and of his town centre first vision. I think we would all be in agreement that derelict sites and buildings are haunting our cities. They are the ghosts of once-used homes and buildings left to fall into decay and disrepair.We know the phrase ""ghost signs"" when we see those old shop signs on buildings. Well we have ghost homes everywhere across our cities and towns that were once in use and have fallen into disrepair. At a time of chronic housing shortage when over 12,400 people are homeless, when we see spiralling rents and queues around the block for apartment viewings, vacancy and dereliction should offend all of us who want to see an end to the housing crisis. Vacancy and dereliction are antisocial behaviours. Allowing buildings to fall into disrepair that could be used for homes is antisocial behaviour. Policies that enable or facilitate houses and sites to fall into dereliction are antisocial. Again, I think we all agree on that. We know that official figures on dereliction and vacancy are somewhat contested. The Government's own vacant homes action plan identified about 166,000 vacant homes in January of this year, which is 7.8% of housing stock. We know that about 37,000 homes have become vacant since 2016, which is scandalous in itself. Hardware Association Ireland has done some really good investigate work on how to designate vacancy and, crucially, the level of vacancy that can be tackled and how many homes can be brought back into use. That is really important. In his response to Deputy Matthews's Bill, the Minister of State spoke about initiatives being taken by the Government to address dereliction and vacancy. Certainly there are many initiatives coming out of the Department. I do not think anyone would deny that. One housing provider said to me that the three words that sum up the Minister's housing policy are ""initiative, initiative, initiative"". The problem is the lack of implementation, action and results. We are just not seeing results on tackling vacancy or indeed on delivery of homes. I am conscious the Government announced another fund this week for vacancy. This is on top of the vacant homes plan announced in January, yet another initiative. The difficulty for many of those seeking to provide homes, including social and affordable homes, or to build homes, is that the lack of detail and quite often the cumbersome red tape surrounding different initiatives has had the effect of creating uncertainty around the delivery of homes. That is a real issue the Minister needs to address. People who are in the business of providing homes need greater certainty as to how these measures will be implemented. For example, it does not help matters when the Minister promises the planning legislation mentioned by the Minister of State. We were promised that we would have that legislation this summer but this has not happened. I know it has been put back to the autumn. We were promised that legislation for the first refusal scheme for those renters who are facing the awful prospect of eviction following the lifting of the no-fault eviction ban would be with us before the summer recess but it is still not with us and we understand it will not be with us until the autumn. The delays, uncertainty and red tape are certainly not helping in the delivery of homes or the implementation of measures to address vacancy. Deputy Matthews's Bill has some very commendable proposals within it that seek in a practical and creative way to tackle vacancy. His proposal that the derelict sites register be subject to online publication and that there would be a duty to notify the Minister after two years on the derelict sites register along with the strengthening of local authorities to CPO vacant and derelict buildings are all really important measures that could and should be taken up by Government. Regarding current Government policies on dereliction and vacancy, we know there is a vacant homes tax. The Labour Party welcomed that. It is self-assessed at three times the local property tax rate. There is also a derelict sites register and derelict sites are subject to an annual levy but the derelict sites register is really lacking in any sort of reality. Just walking around my constituency of Dublin Bay South, we all know there is dereliction and vacancy on almost every street and yet when I look at the derelict sites register for Dublin City Council, I can identify only 12 properties in Dublin Bay South that are on it. There is a real difficulty with how we implement policies on dereliction. Policies may be there that are very positive and constructive but how do we implement them and ensure enforcement? How do we ensure that local authorities have the capacity to pursue and take action against dereliction? How do we ensure that speculators are not simply sitting on properties waiting for the value to go up? The Labour Party has been putting forward creative and constructive proposals such as a ""use it or lose it"" rule regarding uncommenced planning permissions on vacant property. We should be capable of taking action against that. The five-year period is too long. It encourages speculation. Let us look instead at reducing that to three years. Let us take action against those 30,000 live residential planning permissions across the Dublin City Council area that should be activated. Nobody is penalised for sitting on them and failing to activate them. Let us look at creative measures that can be employed to tackle vacancy and dereliction. There is huge concern in my constituency about the failure to deliver social and affordable housing and nowhere is this more the case than Poolbeg and the Irish Glass Bottle site. I marched last week with the Irish Glass Bottle Housing Action Group in Ringsend. This group wants to see homes built. These are residents are actively seeking the building of homes and the delivery of up to 900 social and affordable homes promised on site and are desperately disappointed by the slow pace and the reneging on commitments to deliver on those social and affordable homes. There is uncertainty surrounding the delivery of so much and uncertainty around the Government's plans to tackle dereliction and we need to see more action and more results."	spk_378
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-07-12	dail	33	Investment in Football: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_10	"I will start by paying tribute to our colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, for his immense passion and his immense and long-standing commitment to the game of football and for the incredible eloquence of his ""Football is Ireland"" speech earlier, which everyone has commended. I thank colleagues across the House for supporting the motion. I welcome those joining us in the Gallery from local clubs and our great international players, Niall Quinn, Paddy Mulligan and Turlough O'Connor. I thank the members of my local teams who joined us outside, particularly the great players Millie, Zoe, Rose and Matilda from Harold's Cross Youth Football Club and Councillor Fiona Connelly and the team from Larkview FC in Kimmage. It was wonderful to see so many outside with us earlier for our Labour Party motion. I will also mention a club in my local area that would have loved to attend and that has sent strong support and expressed to me its frustration at the lack of resources for pitches and so on. The team, Belmont FC in Donnybrook, cannot be here today. Very sadly, many of its members are attending this morning's funeral in Donnybrook church of Andrew O'Donnell, one of the two young men, along with Max Wall, who tragically died in Ios so recently. I attended Max Wall's funeral on Monday. I again extend my sympathies and condolences to his family and to the family of Andrew O'Donnell, whose funeral is today. They are an immense loss to their communities and their families and friends. There are few sports that are so capable of lifting communities as football. We have seen that expression of support for soccer across the House. Many of us are old enough to remember the excitement of Italia '90. I know we are all hopeful and optimistic that our wonderful women's team is going to capture the spirit of a nation again and lift our spirits in Australia and perhaps even in New Zealand over the coming months as they play in the FIFA Women's World Cup. We also know how much football helps to bond communities at local level. I have mentioned some of our local clubs in Dublin Bay South but there are so many great clubs, including Cambridge FC and St. Patrick's YFC in Ringsend and Irishtown, Lourdes Celtic FC in Kimmage, Terenure Rangers and Beechwood FC, to name just some.These clubs are really helping to bond groups within communities, and to lift health and morale among children in particular. However, I want to say that for far too long girls' football has been the poor relation. While football has been a poor relation politically among sports in Ireland, unfortunately, we have seen girls' football in particular really disadvantaged. I am someone who is passionate about bringing girls forward through football. I have worked for many years at local level through Larkview FC, and before that Inchicore Athletic FC girls, to bring up girls' football. We have seen that significant barriers remain to girls' and women's participation at equal level in sport. We had Lisa Fallon speaking passionately to us recently at an Oireachtas briefing about just how difficult it is for so many girls to participate fully in sport, particularly with the lack of facilities. We know from the FAI's report that 38% of clubs do not have women's toilets, and I want to commend the FAI on putting forward a very strong 15-year strategy that looks to grow the sport at local grassroots level and at League of Ireland and international levels. I agree with its strong emphasis on developing facilities, and ensuring that there are equal changing facilities for women and girls. I welcome the announcement of the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, with the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, at Farmleigh last week of the additional funding for women's sport to bring forward women's coaching and player development, but we need to see that investment in facilities as well. We will certainly be continuing to press for that. We also want to see stronger support programmes for players, including centralised contracts for young women and men. We are all mindful that it is only six years since the women's international team had to strike to get decent facilities. I was chairperson of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Gender Equality and we made recommendations about making sports funding conditional on gender equality measures. Again, I very much welcome the Minister of State's announcement on sports capital funding. That is very important, but we need to ensure football is accessible to all, including children with disabilities, and LGBT children and adults. We need to see football moving to tackle racism and homophobia, and to see football being inclusive for all, with the development of all-weather pitches so everyone in every community can play. I know that is the vision we all share. The time has come for football. We are glad that the Government has not opposed our motion, but the campaign does not stop here. We in the Labour Party will continue to work to realise that ambition for Ireland to develop one of the best women's and men's leagues in the world, to make football fully accessible to all, and to break down the barriers that still hinder the participation of women and girls in the beautiful game. I want to end by wishing Vera Pauw's army, the wonderful Abbie Larkin from Ringsend, Katie McCabe and all the players on our team the very best. We will be rooting for them in the FIFA Women's World Cup."	spk_54

This week, as the focus has been on other matters in the news, a hugely significant story has gone relatively unmarked. According to the UN, the first week of July was the hottest week on record globally ever. Indeed, June 2023 has blown away all temperature records for that month. The science is clear. All that we hold dear is threatened by the climate crisis. Unless we as a species choose to live more sustainably, we face extinction.I refer to the choice to live more sustainably because it is a choice. Political choices are made every day and are what can save us from climate and biodiversity breakdown. I welcome that just in the past few minutes MEPs have voted to adopt the Nature Restoration Law in the European Parliament and in particular, MEPs voted against the shameful attempts by the European People's Party, the Taoiseach's own political grouping, to force a boycott of the Nature Restoration Law. I welcome the fact that Fine Gael MEPs voted not to block the Nature Restoration Law. We understand from them that they faced down pressure from within the EPP and they have said that they prefer to engage with the process. Their choice is a welcome departure from the very dangerous rhetoric we have seen from their EPP colleagues, and notably the EPP president, Manfred Weber. I ask the Taoiseach to clarify and confirm his own commitment to the vitally important Nature Restoration Law. Does he condemn the rhetoric of Manfred Weber who is the president of the European People’s Party, the Taoiseach's own party in Europe, and does he agree with the Labour Party’s sister parties and the Party of European Socialists who have really driven the Nature Restoration Law, along with their Green Party colleagues in the green group? They have said that Mr. Weber has engaged in disinformation on the law and has courted the support of the far-right in Europe. I wanted to seek clarification on another important Government climate policy which relates to just transition and supporting a transition to a low-carbon economy in a way which leaves no one behind. Mary Robinson said at COP27 that just transition requires a series of just transformations, a rising tide to lift all boats to tackle the inequality and injustice while building a sustainable future. The Taoiseach's Government has previously committed to establishing a just transition commission to design an inclusive response to the climate and biodiversity crises. Last night, the National Economic and Social Council called for the speedy establishment of the commission and the Taoiseach welcomed that but I understand that there are real concerns that the project to establish this commission has been stalled and, indeed, trade union and civil society representatives have written to him this week warning against any further delay in establishing the commission. Will the Taoiseach use his powers under the National Economic and Social Development Office Act to set up the just transition commission without delay and will he ensure that it is based on social dialogue in keeping with the International Labour Organization, ILO, just transition principles? We want to see its terms of reference place that emphasis on social dialogue to ensure that the real and meaningful just transition is reached.	spk_116

That is the issue with the correspondence he has received this week from representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, from the Environmental Pillar, Irish Rural Link, Social Justice Ireland, Friends of the Earth, and others, who are concerned about the delays in establishing the just transition commission. Indeed, if we look at the great work of the citizens' assembly on climate action and biodiversity, it also talks about the need for community engagement. That is why we need to see that commission set up without delay and to ensure that it does engage meaningfully with the community. We know that communities which have the most to lose from transition need to be consulted, invested in and supported. We have also seen this reflected at international level where the ILO is talking about just transition having to include consultations, exchange of information and forms of dialogue between the social partners and governments. How will the Taoiseach be responding to the civil society groups and trade unions which have corresponded with him this week on the just transition commission and can he give a commitment - I know he said he cannot give a date - that the commission will be established within a particular timeframe and that its terms of reference will be clear on that need for social dialogue?	spk_118

Second, on the most stark metric, we are seeing the figures for homelessness rising, with more than 12,400 people now in emergency accommodation. Today's update announced a public consultation on the private rental sector, but there is nothing concrete in the report to help renters.Meantime, we heard reports yesterday that there are delays in introducing legislation on the first refusal scheme, a scheme which the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, promised us would be in place by the summer to provide some supports to renters facing homelessness and eviction. Just now, in response to a parliamentary question, the Minister has told me that he has no plans to reinstate the winter eviction ban this winter. Does the Taoiseach accept that the Government is simply failing renters and failing to provide adequate protections for renters? When can he say that the first refusal scheme will be properly in place for renters?	spk_79

I also offer my deep sympathies to the families, friends and all those affected by the tragic deaths of Andrew O’Donnell and Max Wall in Ios last weekend. The devastating losses of these two boys who had just finished the leaving certificate examination at St. Michael's College, Ballsbridge, has impacted so many. I offer my sympathies in particular to the school community at St. Michael's College, where I attended a memorial service last night for the two boys. We saw an immense outpouring of grief and support for the families and friends of the boys. It was especially poignant as it took place in the same chapel where they had their graduation ceremony just six weeks ago. I offer sincere condolences to the O’Donnell and Wall families and all affected. The Tánaiste's Department has been to the fore and has been working hard to support the families and all those other students in Ios at the same time. Last night, school principal, Tim Kelleher, gave particular thanks to Department of Foreign Affairs staff. I also wish to join the welcome to the Palestinian ambassador, H.E. Dr. Jilan Wahba Abdalmajid. It has been my pleasure to meet the ambassador on several occasions. I join others in calling for stronger leadership from Ireland on solidarity with the people of Palestine, in particular this week, following the horrific actions of the Israel Defense Forces in Jenin. Several of us raised this issue earlier this week. I reiterate my calls for the Government to seek to pass the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018, for which there is cross-party support. I wish also to refer to another issue related to the Tánaiste's ministerial brief. The Women of Honour group expressed serious concern about the plans for the Government’s statutory inquiry to investigate allegations of sexual assault, discrimination, harassment and bullying of women in the Defence Forces, brought forward, courageously, by the members of the group. They say they cannot support what they see as a grossly inadequate inquiry with deeply flawed terms of reference. I understand the Tánaiste will meet the group today at 5 p.m. in advance of bringing forward proposals for the inquiry to Cabinet next week. We welcome the Government's commitment to holding a statutory inquiry. I ask that the Tánaiste take on board the concerns expressed by the group and that the Government moves swiftly to establish a tribunal of inquiry based on the proposed terms of reference the Women of Honour drafted. The group is anxious to ensure that the terms include an investigation into the workplace culture pertaining in the Defence Forces. It is a key issue because, as the Labour Party defence spokesperson, Senator Wall, said, the Defence Forces are in crisis following years of neglect and there is a recruitment and retention crisis, in particular. To address that, we must ensure we are addressing the toxic culture which the allegations from Women of Honour uncovered. I ask the Tánaiste if he accepts that the calls of the Women of Honour must be heeded as part of an overall response to the recruitment and retention issues plaguing our Defence Forces today.	spk_179

Indeed, things are changing at a rapid pace. As Senator Sherlock has said, this constant, ongoing drip-feed of new revelations is unsustainable. Since the statements before this House last night, we have learned about the existence of three barter accounts, we have learned about €2.2 million in losses for the toy show musical and, in the past half hour, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, issued a statement to say that she had spoken to the chair of the board and the chair has informed her that the board have seen their trust and confidence in the executive being eroded and have requested that swift action be taken. The chair is to speak more on this issue before the media committee today. Clearly, things are changing at a rapid pace.Does this new detail, as outlined by the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, change the view the Taoiseach expressed half an hour ago of expressing confidence in the RTÉ executive? If not, how much longer will the Taoiseach and the Government give them the benefit of the doubt?	spk_85
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-07-05	dail	33	Health (Termination of Pregnancy Services) (Safe Access Zones) Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_20	"I am delighted to speak on behalf of the Labour Party on this important Bill and to express our warm welcome for it. I thank the Minister for introducing it in the House. As he said, it is in keeping with a long-standing commitment. It is long-awaited and long overdue. We have just marked the fifth anniversary of the repeal vote. The need for safe access zones and the introduction of such legislation was widely spoken about at the time. It was included in successive legislative programmes in 2019 and in the programme for Government in 2020. We are now in July 2023. It is unfortunate it has taken this long, particularly when a cross-party Private Members' Bill was introduced in the Seanad by Senator Gavan. The Labour Party was proud to co-sponsor that Bill with Senator Gavan and his colleagues because it was drafted by the fantastic activist organisation, Together for Safety, working with Senators. It received strong support. If we had been able to use that Bill, it would have been a swifter way to move to a space where we would have safe access zones in law. I am conscious that members of the Together for Safety campaign in Limerick have joined us in the Gallery this afternoon, including Karen, Evie and their colleagues. I welcome them and pay tribute to their valiant campaigning and focus on this important issue. I will mention the work of Labour Party activists who have consistently supported Together for Yes in Limerick, including our former Deputy, Jan O'Sullivan, and our councillor, Conor Sheehan. They have been to the fore in calling for the swift introduction of this legislation. We are all in agreement that the Bill is vitally important to those women seeking access to termination of pregnancy services. It is also very important for all healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses, who are seeking to provide such services. It is also important to our democracy in that it is a way in which we can see the will of the people being carried out. In 2018, five years ago, people voted by an overwhelming majority, more than two thirds, for women to have access to abortion services here. Where we see protests obstructing such access, that is really seeking to impede the carrying out of a service that has such an overwhelming democratic mandate. There are other obstacles to accessing such services, and the Minister has alluded to them. I am very glad, as I think all of us will be, to hear the Minister’s remarks about the work that is being undertaken to improve access because we are all conscious of the geographic inconsistency in access to services. According to the recent review, there are currently 13 counties in which fewer than ten GPs are providing access to early abortion services and not yet all maternity hospitals are doing so. I very much welcome the Minister’s commitment today that we are on track to see 17 out of 19 hospitals providing such services by the end of 2023. The rest will do so next year. It is still the case, however, that we have seen a long delay in the roll-out of consistent services nationally. That is a real concern and it is a difficult and distressing experience for many women and girls who are seeking to access services in counties where they are not available.  I was glad to have been invited to give the opening address to a recent conference of abortion providers in Ireland - GPs, hospital doctors and others who are actively engaged in providing abortion services. They spoke with me about their anxiety to see more colleagues join them, particularly GPs. The more GPs who provide the service, the easier it will become and the fewer obstructions there will be for women who are accessing such services. Also, there will be a critical mass to stand up against the intimidation that some GPs are continuing to experience where they are providing services. If they feel isolated within their own local area in providing such services, clearly that is a difficulty. It does not help when we are seeking to ensure that more GPs provide such services. The delay has not helped. This time last year, the Minister promised that this legislation would be in place before last Christmas. I acknowledge the huge progress in debating Second Stage today. I also acknowledge the complexity of drafting, and I will come to that in a minute. We need an assurance that the legislation will be passed without any further delays. We are conscious that this is the second last week of this Dáil term. Perhaps the Minister will indicate when he envisages the legislation will pass both Houses and be brought into effect. That is also a critical timeline for us. As I said, five years ago people voted by an overwhelming majority. I commend all those involved in campaigning. It was a hugely important and compelling campaign run by organisations such as Together for Yes and groups such as Women’s Health Ireland. I was glad to play a part in those and the Minister was also part of the campaign. Our Labour Party slogan during the 2018 referendum campaign was “For Compassion in a Crisis”. That was the overwhelming feeling and emotion that arose in the referendum vote. People were voting for compassion and empathy. There was an understanding and appreciation of the huge difficulty and distress that so many women in crisis pregnancies were in because their crisis was being compounded by having to travel abroad for necessary healthcare. The national conversation which took place in the run-up to the vote on 25 May 2018 and which was, as the Minister said, conducted in a respectful and dignified manner, for the most part, provided the space for those who were undecided in advance of the referendum to make a journey towards a position where they could vote ""Yes"". It was founded on empathy and compassion and it put an end to the chill that the eighth amendment had cast over my generation and so many women for so long. In 2018, this country said we had enough of a lack of compassion and decades of secrecy, shame, exile and isolation for women in crisis pregnancy. It is remarkable, looking back on it, to think that almost 1.5 million people voted for the constitutional change. Therefore, it is incumbent on us all as legislators to ensure that where a woman seeks to access abortion care in line with that overwhelming vote, she may do so free of intimidation and harassment. That is why we have always pushed for the introduction of safe access zone laws. As the Minister has said and as we all know, these laws are in place across other jurisdictions. They are vital for the provision of accessible, safe abortion services in Ireland. The Bill before us provides for the designation of such zones, within 100 m of healthcare premises, where conduct aimed at impeding or obstructing access or influencing decisions in relation to the termination of a pregnancy will be prohibited. We are very glad to support that provision. We do so noting that the intimidating protests that are regularly taking place outside hospitals and GPs serve as a barrier to accessing vital medical care. They also, as I have said, create a chilling effect on the provision of abortion services, particularly in areas where coverage is already low and GPs may already feel they are easily identifiable and therefore isolated. We have heard from Marie O’Shea’s review and Catherine Conlon’s work about the huge distress that women remain in, despite the change in the law because they are forced to travel for care. They must make the journey twice due to the mandatory three-day waiting period requirement. That crisis is compounded further when women are faced with intimidation and protests on arriving at a clinic or hospital. GPs from rural areas in particular have reported to my office that they, their front-line staff, often administrators and receptionists, and patients may be the subject of abuse and intimidation. Most of us have seen some of the posters, heard some of the chants and observed some of the behaviour of those who organise these so-called protests. Some of them gather very near here, outside the National Maternity Hospital, in my own constituency of Dublin Bay South. Of course, individuals are entitled to have different views and, under our Constitution, they are entitled to freedom of assembly and association, but they are not entitled to harass patients who are accessing healthcare or to harass medics and healthcare workers who are doing their jobs."	spk_180
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-07-05	dail	33	Health (Termination of Pregnancy Services) (Safe Access Zones) Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_20	"We have seen really despicable tactics being used in some of these protests, including the appalling practice of displaying small coffins. This is taking place outside maternity hospitals and in a context where they may cause obstruction and intimidation to patients who are accessing all sorts of different services, and their families. We should all reflect on that as we see these so-called protests taking place. These protests amount to an undermining of the democratic will of the people in requiring us to provide abortion services and access to abortion services for women. We have unfortunately a long history of denying services to women. I am thinking of contraception services, which were denied to women and men until the 1990s, around the time when I was in college. We had a condom machine in the student union building at Trinity College Dublin in 1989 and 1990. It was being vandalised every week but it was also in huge demand because at the time it was one of the only places in Ireland where somebody could buy condoms. It is extraordinary to think that was in 1989. The other place was the Virgin Megastore on the quays. The Irish Family Planning Association was providing condoms at the time for a donation because it could not sell them. There was a huge amount of obstruction for so long and highly restrictive rules around access to contraception that would be unthinkable now. There was huge, similar obstruction around access to vasectomies, procedures that we now see as utterly routine and non-contentious. Family planning clinics were regularly vandalised and people were intimidated. Brave and courageous doctors were in some cases just defying cultural repression and Catholic teaching by providing services that we now take for granted. When we are debating the protests, protestors and safe access zones for abortion care, we have to reflect on the fact that, unfortunately, there has been a long history in this country of obstructing access to services around pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and even around contraception. As I said, and as the Minister has also pointed out, there are complexities in drafting this legislation. We acknowledge that. There are particular complexities around the balancing act required to achieve a balance between the right of access to services and the rights of freedom of expression and assembly. I have reviewed some of the submissions to the pre-legislative scrutiny stage of this debate. Many submissions objecting to the concept of safe access zones cited concerns around freedom of expression. The constitutional provisions on freedom of expression, assembly and association are clearly framed in a way that is absolute. These are not absolutely protected rights. Women have the right to bodily integrity and the right to privacy. Therefore, the introduction of these zones, when narrowly defined and framed in such a way that provides safeguards, constitutes a constitutionally robust and proportionate restriction on the right to protest. I know there has been some focus on section 4 and the provision of a warning from a member of the Garda, which is an extra and additional check on the framing of the offence. There is a valid concern around the evidential requirement about the recording of the warning. The Joint Committee on Health examined this matter in detail. Section 4(3) requires that a garda, when recording the warning, must also require that the person given the warning has to state his or her name and address. The fact that a name and address has been provided to a garda will give some comfort to those who are concerned about how it can be proven that the warning was recorded. The fact that the garda will have the name and address and can repeat that back will be important in practice. We welcome this Bill. It is constitutionally robust and we are very committed to seeing it pass into law and to seeing safe access zones instituted in our law. We have looked for them for some time. Before I conclude, I want to refer to the other barriers to women's access, not just the geographic issues or the numbers of GPs and hospitals providing such services but the barriers that still exist within the legislation and which were the subject of Marie O’Shea’s recent review. I pay tribute to Marie O'Shea, Dr. Catherine Conlon and those involved in carrying out the review because its recommendations are strong, evidence-based and focused on addressing unnecessary structural barriers to women's access to abortion services. Along with many others, the Labour Party made a substantial submission to the review process. Among the changes we called for was the abolition of the three-day waiting period, a mandatory requirement which we believe is paternalistic and unnecessary and imposes an unnecessary and completely non-medically required barrier on women's access. We also called for an end to the criminalisation of doctors who do not conform with the legislation. It is not in keeping with our laws on healthcare, as the Minister for Health will be well aware. Again, that creates an unnecessary chilling effect on medical providers, particularly those who may be contemplating becoming a provider of services. We have also called for review of definitions. In Dr. Conlon's research, and when we hear from our constituents and others, we hear about women still travelling to Britain because they cannot access abortion care at home. We hear about awful scenarios, including of women awaiting diagnosis as to whether a foetal anomaly is ""fatal enough"" to enable a termination within the terms of the legislation. Doctors tell us that the definition of fatal foetal anomaly is simply not aligned with medical practice and medical and healthcare understandings. I know the Joint Committee on Health is looking at the Marie O'Shea review recommendations but we need to see urgent movement on implementing those recommendations. I welcome the statement by the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, at the weekend that she personally is in support of removing the three-day waiting period imposed on women who have already resolved to seek a termination but who are forced to have a second visit or consultation with a doctor. I hope the Minister will be joined by more of her Government colleagues and that there will be a shift away from the rather disappointing commentary we have seen since the O'Shea report was published, including, for example, comments made by the Taoiseach which seemed to be less supportive of the recommendations than we might have hoped. I am conscious that we debated Deputy Bríd Smith's Bill in this House and had a debate on some of the recommendations in the report. Let us move swiftly on this legislation and implement those strong recommendations that are evidence-based and seek to remove structural barriers to care. Without the removal of those barriers and without the necessary reform of the 2018 law, we are still going to see the sort of paternalism that characterised the eighth amendment and the case law under it. We are going to see that paternalistic shadow still cast over women and women in crisis pregnancy. While I am glad the Government is tackling the clear and overt harassment and intimidation that unfortunately is still going on and being used against women seeking abortion care, I would also like to see the Government take on the structural barriers in our legislation which have the effect of frustrating, intimidating and restricting women who are seeking an abortion. These barriers are also creating this chilling effect upon doctors and medics who are trying to provide care. Reproductive healthcare should be a matter between a woman and her doctor. Without removing the unnecessary structural barriers to reproductive healthcare, the Government will still be failing in its duty to women, in particular the thousands of women who continue to experience crisis pregnancy each year and the many hundreds who are still having to travel abroad years after we voted to repeal the eighth amendment and so long after we voted for compassion in a crisis. This is something I feel strongly about, having been involved in pro-choice campaigning for as long as I have. If I had been told 30 years ago that it would take so long to achieve a position where women in crisis pregnancy could access healthcare rights here in Ireland, I would have been desperately frustrated, particularly at a time when we were being threatened with prison just for giving women a phone number of a clinic in England. Again, that was a time when we could not even access condoms legally. Clearly, huge strides have been made but that is 30 years ago. We are still debating a three-day waiting period that is clearly medically unwarranted and, as we all know, was simply put into the draft legislation at the last minute before the referendum took place. It was unwarranted. There were already enough restrictions in the legislation. It seems extraordinary that we are still debating this issue when we have seen such a clear vote from the people and we are increasingly seeing doctors who are stepping up. I want to finish on that optimistic note. Doctors and healthcare providers are stepping up. It was incredibly powerful to see how many came to a conference that was explicitly for abortion providers and about abortion providers hearing from each other in Ireland about how they are providing services and how they can best meet the needs of their patients. It was incredibly powerful to see that happen in a country that, as recently as five years ago, still did not have legal abortion in place. We have made huge strides but it is time to up the pace and increase the momentum with which we are making the necessary changes. We all recognise that they must be made. They include the removal of the three-day wait period, the removal of the criminalisation of doctors and revisiting the definitions in law that are unnecessarily restrictive and mean that women are still having to travel for healthcare we should be getting here at home."	spk_182

There is not a single community, nor a single sphere of our society, which is untouched by the housing crisis. This housing and homelessness crisis is getting worse. It is hampering our health system, our education system and our entire economy. Yet, the quality of debate surrounding the lifting of the temporary, no-fault eviction ban was deeply frustrating. For months prior to its lifting, we in the Opposition asked what the Government would do to introduce emergency measures to protect renters from homelessness once the ban was lifted and, for months, it insisted a plan was in train. The week the ban was lifted, we saw a series of half-baked, hastily launched plans. For some of them, including the first-refusal scheme, we are still in the dark about how they will work or when they will come into effect. All the while, the housing crisis was getting worse. This is the second-last week before the Houses will rise for the summer. It is as good a time as any, in fact it is a vital time, for the Government to show a little humility and to change tack on housing policy. News broke on Friday last that 12,441 people are now recorded as homeless, which is an increase of 182 people in one month alone. We know that these numbers understate the true scale of the problem as they only record those in State-resourced emergency accommodation. Having one person in homelessness is clearly one too many, but to see the numbers of homeless people rising every month under this Administration in 2023, when the Government is running budget surpluses, is appalling. The effects of insecure housing on families, in particular, are severe and long lasting. We know from these figures there are 3,699 children in homelessness. They are being deprived of the safety and security which they and their parents should be able to take for granted in Ireland in 2023. That is why it is so frustrating to hear so little support from the Government benches for constructive proposals from the Opposition, such as the Labour Party’s homeless families Bill, supported by Focus Ireland, which would ensure the rights of children are prioritised when a family is facing the prospect of losing their home. There has been a similar lack of support from the Government for measures we also proposed, such as our evidence basis for lifting the eviction ban. In October 2022, the Minister of State said the ban would provide a respite to the Government to address core issues and take up measures, such as emergency beds and tackling vacancy. The Taoiseach took office in December promising to prioritise homelessness, yet the Government is failing the nearly 12,500 people now in homelessness	spk_28

This has a real-life effect on people. My office is in touch with a mother of three who has a newborn baby. She is a housing assistance payment, HAP, tenant who is in fear of eviction. She is sleeping on the couch in her rented apartment while her baby sleeps in his pram because they have no space. They are in fear of losing even the limited space they have. Therefore, the Government’s policies are not helping her and they are not helping renters. We have welcomed proposals from the Government that would genuinely increase supply. We supported the Land Development Agency, LDA. However, we are asking those in government to take on board the constructive measures we proposed, such as our renters’ rights Bill, that would provide better security to renters, like that mother of three and the thousands of people who are increasing in number every month, despite the Government’s policies and, in some cases, because of them. Let me remind the Taoiseach that in October 2022, the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, said that the temporary ban would allow the Government the respite space to: ""address core underlying issues driving our homelessness levels [by providing] more emergency beds, tackling vacancy, using modular homes and improving allocations and relettings to make the most of existing stock"". Where are those measures now? Can the Taoiseach say that we will not see a further increase in next month’s homelessness figures?"	spk_30

The reason it has commanded so much attention is because RTÉ is so central to our day-to-day lives and to our society. As our public service broadcaster, it sets the day-to-day news agenda. It is central to our democracy, being outside the control of profit-driven shareholders or billionaires, like so much other national and international media. It is our public service broadcaster. I recall the Minister's predecessor, Michael D. Higgins saying during the 2008 debate on the Broadcasting Act, that we must recall the clear distinction between public service broadcasting, on the one hand, and the public service broadcaster on the other. There is a crucial difference between licence obligations imposed on private media organisations to provide news, weather and other public information roles. There is a distinction between that and the separate and vital role played by the State-sanctioned national broadcaster that is supposed to reflect all the diversity in Ireland, and which is supposed to represent our best values. RTÉ lists its values as outward looking, creative, respectful, collaborative and transparent. That is what has caused this issue to dominate proceedings to such an extent because we see these values as being absent in the total failure of governance. An article was published on the RTÉ website today, by Oonagh Smyth from ""Prime Time"" referring to the total failure of corporate governance. That is the phrase that has really been dominating the discussion about the secret payments. It is not just about the payments themselves; it is about the failure of governance involved. I wish to pay tribute to the staff of RTÉ. Within the last two weeks, while their organisation has been the focus of so much controversy, they have kept doing their jobs, particularly the staff in current affairs and in news who have covered this issue robustly and have presented strong analysis. They have spoken both publicly and privately about their sense of betrayal at the organisation and the way the organisation has behaved. We have all heard Emma O'Kelly's words as a representative of the National Union of Journalists within RTÉ. She wrote in the  The Labour Party is proud to support public service broadcasting and the national broadcaster. We have done so since the foundation of what became Radio Éireann in 1926.Indeed, the Labour Party and Michael D. Higgins established Teilifís na Gaeilge, now TG4, which was opposed by many at the time and considered an unnecessary adventure. It was described as ""Teilifís DeLorean"" at one stage. Of course, now we see it as a vitally important expansion of public service broadcasting through the medium of our national language, ár dteanga náisiúnta, which is so well enhanced and protected by TG4. We need to restate the crucial importance of the public service broadcaster and not allow this crisis to be used to shrink or destroy RTÉ. It must emerge stronger and better than before but to do so, many changes must take place. During the pandemic, we were all reminded of the vital role a public service broadcaster plays. RTÉ played a critical role during lockdown, providing information, analysis and much-needed education for our children. That is it at its best. It is essential that we restore confidence and pride in RTÉ and ensure its financial future is secure. There is a requirement for absolute transparency. The drip-feed of revelations around the secret payments and around governance issues has done massive harm. The marathon sessions at the Oireachtas media committee and the Committee of Public Accounts have generated more questions that still demand answers. There are outstanding questions. Others have spoken already about the questions that are still out there. There is one illustrative example that sums it up, and that is the fact that we still do not know what the losses were from  Turning to the review the Minister announced today, we very much welcome that announcement. We welcome the Minister's statement that it would be a root-and-branch examination. It is going to be conducted in two strands and chaired by Professor Niamh Brennan and Dr. Margaret Cullen. We welcome those appointments. The first strand will be about governance and culture and the second, critically, will be a separate review of contractor fees, human resources and other workplace matters. We very much welcome that second strand. This day last week during Leaders' Questions, I raised with the Taoiseach the need to ensure that workplace culture in RTÉ, employment conditions and, crucially, the issue of bogus self-employment would be considered in the review. The Taoiseach at that point seemed somewhat sceptical and thought that might be too broad but I am very glad the Minister has included it within the terms of that parallel strand because that is vital. We are hearing that from the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, and we have been hearing it for some time. Just this afternoon, Séamus Dooley from the NUJ spoke at the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, biennial delegate conference and welcomed this review. He said it was a welcome first step in restoring public confidence. It will also be greatly welcomed by those working within RTÉ, including the staff and the many freelancers who for so long have been kept at arm's length by the organisation, while providing vital work and being as much part of the talent pool as the so-called talent at the top end of the organisation. We have been hearing for years about the poor conditions for freelancers with the low fees and rounds of cost savings and redundancies, with RTÉ actually looking for more money at a time when we now know these secret payments were being made. I very much welcome, as do all in the Labour Party, the two strands of the review. I also welcome the appointment of the forensic accountant that the Minister intends to make under section 109 of the Broadcasting Act. That will presumably happen alongside the four-week process of the further Grant Thornton report. The Minister might say when she anticipates the forensic accountant appointment will be made and how broadly drawn the remit of that accountancy exercise will be. I note the Minister has said she is reserving the right to broaden the scope depending on what else emerges from the committee hearings, and we are all conscious that there are a number of different parallel strands, but that is important. The emergency motion put forward by the NUJ today points out that one consequence of the secret payments is that they were kept secret by the director general - it appears, or certainly by the organisation - from the trade union group and therefore, the unions within RTÉ were negotiating in good faith with management, over years it seems, despite the existence of secret undisclosed payments negotiated with a third-party agency for someone who was already highly paid. That clearly undermines trust in industrial relations machinery generally because the unions were negotiating on the basis of financial information with which they had been supplied that we now know was not accurate. What the unions are seeking, as outlined by Emma O'Kelly at the weekend, is fourfold. These are four reasonable asks that we hope the review will focus on. First is a cap on earnings within RTÉ to end this practice of extremely high earnings. The second is an end to third-party contracts. The third ask is for RTÉ to be a model of best practice and fourth, for a sustainable funding system to be put in place into the future. The Minister set up a Future of Media Commission and some of those recommendations around reform of the licence system have been parked. We all understand that existential matters of credibility and governance have been disclosed in recent weeks that need to be resolved first. Undoubtedly, however, the decision on the future funding model must be grasped because we all know the TV licence model is outdated and no longer fit for purpose. We have looked, as I am sure the Minister has, at Finland and the progressive income tax introduced there to replace the pre-existing licence fee that was rather similar to our own. That model might be a more appropriate one as it would no longer be based on the number of TV sets in the house, which seems so outdated when people are streaming content in so many different ways. We must ensure that what emerges from this is a public service broadcaster that has its credibility restored, that has good practice - best practice - in corporate governance, with a radical reform of internal decision-making and checks and balances structures. I am looking at comments like those of Conor Power, who said the key question for that governance audit must be why this did not come to light sooner. If we can answer that, we can see an appropriate way forward to construct a model of corporate governance that has appropriate checks and balances within it, that does not give quite so much power to the decision-making of one person and that will ensure restoration of public confidence and trust in what is a crucial part of our democracy and our democratic system, that is, our national public service broadcaster. We very much welcome the review. We look forward to working with colleagues in government and across the House through the committee system and elsewhere. I ask that the interim reports and the final report come before the Oireachtas. I acknowledge they will be submitted to the Minister but it is important that we, as legislators and public representatives, also have an opportunity to debate the findings of both reviews."	spk_185

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-06-28	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_11	Despite the publication yesterday of a lengthy statement from RTÉ we still lack clarity on a number of important questions. We have no clarification, for example, as to why the payments made to Ryan Tubridy were consistently understated. We have been asked to believe the incredible allegation, which the Taoiseach said he does not believe to be credible, that out of all the senior management at RTÉ, only Dee Forbes knew the full picture regarding additional payments made. Yesterday, I noted that we are all in the dark, including, it seems, the Government and the Taoiseach, and we are still in the dark today. However, what I want to focus on today are the people who are most hurt by this breach of trust, namely, the workers at RTÉ, the staff and employees who give their all to deliver accurate, impartial information to all of us, because public service broadcasting matters. It matters to us as democrats, as citizens, as taxpayers and as members of a society with a fundamental stake in knowing that a trusted media organisation can provide us with accurate reporting. It matters to the RTÉ employees. The heartbreak was audible in the voices of those who so bravely spoke out at the solidarity protest organised by RTÉ employees yesterday. I offer my own solidarity and that of the Labour Party with all of those employees, with the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, and its representatives in RTÉ, and the workers who spoke so eloquently about their sense of betrayal at the breach of trust. As the Taoiseach said, they spoke about the double standard apparently operating and the fact there appear to be special payments for special people within RTÉ while others languish on bogus self-employment contracts or on poor terms and conditions. As Emma O’Kelly put it, it is unbelievable that someone who was earning €440,000 per year needed to get more money and to get it in secret. Paul Cunningham spoke about how freelancers in RTÉ are paid a pittance, by contrast. They are continually told, “We do not have the money to support you - take it or leave it.” My first question related to workers' rights is, will the external review focus on the need to ensure equity within RTÉ? Will it focus on an end to special payments for special people, an end to third-party presenter negotiations and a cap on presenters' pay? My second question also relates to workers' rights. It is about the apparently widespread use of bogus self-employment contracts, about which Deputy Nash and Senator Sherlock and I have raised issues for years. Such contracts deprive workers of security, maternity pay, benefits and holiday entitlements. They are simply wrong in an institution, particularly where we see this level of inequity. Will the external review focus on that too? We know now there were repeated attempts by management at RTÉ to block the delivery to trade unions of a report into culture at RTÉ. A report was produced last year with alarming findings, especially on gender discrimination. The report was finally released only after the NUJ went to the information commissioner in regard to multiple requests. I understand none of its important recommendations, including those on gender, have yet been implemented. Will the external review also look at the need to implement the recommendations of that report into culture in RTÉ?	spk_105

Members of the public are very hurt by this. We all hear this across our constituencies. However, the direct impact on those who work within RTÉ cannot be overestimated. We heard that yesterday from those who spoke out, who believe passionately, as we all do, in the importance of public service broadcasting. I thank the Taoiseach for pointing out that the Minister, Deputy Martin, will meet the trade union group today. That is welcome. However, I urge the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Martin, to ensure the terms of the review include those issues I raised relating to workers' rights. It is essential. It is simply not enough for those employees who believe they may be on bogus contracts to themselves have to go to the Department about it. That is simply not a reality for those who feel vulnerable. Again, yesterday, at the NUJ protest, we heard from Trevor Keegan, a so-called ""evershed"" employee, one of those who had to fight tooth and nail for decent conditions. The Revenue Commissioners were on to him, telling him he was staff and that RTÉ should pay PRSI. It took years to resolve that issue. This is a serious issue. It contributes to the sense of betrayal felt by those within RTÉ. It also contributes to that sense of immense inequity that ten presenters might be so-called talent, rather than the vast bulk of the staff in RTÉ who are doing their best. I urge the Taoiseach to include workers' rights and give them priority within the terms of the review."	spk_107

According to the CSO, about 8% of dwellings in Ireland are vacant. We observe vacancy and dereliction across our communities in our towns and cities yet the last time I looked at the derelict homes register in my area, it only had ten derelict properties in Dublin Bay South. In any constituency, that would represent a drop in the ocean in terms of the number of properties that are vacant or derelict. What measures are proposed by the Government to ensure we will have an effective derelict homes register in operation across the country? Will the Government ensure there are sufficient numbers of vacant homes officers across the country in councils to investigate vacancy and dereliction properly and ensure that there are consequences for allowing properties to fall into dereliction and ensure we can have some trust in the levels of vacancy and dereliction that are reported? Clearly, there is a huge issue about just knowing which properties are vacant and derelict currently.	spk_120

The first message I would send is that we should not be alarmist when debating it. It states that 97% of the 148 identified bathing waters met the minimum standard required, so there are positive stories. There are other positive developments, including the new ""See It? Say It!"" app, where members of the public can report pollution where they see it. I welcome these initiatives. However, there are also serious problems. Urban wastewater incidents, agricultural run-off, fouling from dogs and algal blooms were factors that impacted negatively on beaches last year. We are all familiar with the no-swim notices circulated and displayed in places like Seapoint and the Forty Foot in Dublin and around the country where there are issues with water quality. This is an issue across the country. My colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, speaks with me about issues with the bathing water quality in Balbriggan. It is certainly an issue for my constituency of Dublin Bay South. I regularly hear from constituents, many of whom are associated with the great Sandymount and Merrion Residents Association, SAMRA, who tell me about the discharges they see of raw sewage directly onto Sandymount beach and Merrion Strand. As a regular sea swimmer at Poolbeg on the South Wall, I have seen evidence of large volumes of raw sewage deposited onto the beach. It is a public health issue for swimmers, dog walkers and walkers generally. It is nothing short of wholesale pollution, which if done by a commercial company would result in immediate closure. The official bathing season starts on 1 June and runs until 15 September. Many of us swim year round, however, and there are reports of people becoming ill after swimming in the sea outside the official bathing season. Just last week, swimmers were advised to steer clear of Seapoint due to heavy rain. It is well known that you see the no-swim notices going up when there is heavy rain. It is because of sewage. It is appalling and extraordinary that, in a city that is lucky to have such an incredible coastline, swimming spots and public amenities on our doorstep, we do not take greater care of these amenities. In October 2022, in reply to a question put by me in the Dáil, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, committed to year-round testing of water, but we still await a commitment in respect of treatment, a proper vision and proper implementation of controls for swimmers and others who wish to use the bay. I will refer to my proposed vision for Dublin Bay, but I will also acknowledge the immense work that has been done by local organisations, for example, the Half Moon Swimming and Water Polo Club, which has a strong presence and long history on the South Wall at Poolbeg. It does a large amount of work. Mr. Murray's  There is a task force that looks at Dublin Bay and seeks to protect this UNESCO site, but because of its lack of teeth and statutory basis, we have seen Dublin Port Company playing a dominant role in deciding the bay’s future. I made a lengthy submission to the Dublin Port Company in recent weeks on its 3FM plans for the expansion and development of its facilities at Dublin Bay. It is fair enough that the company has such plans, given that it is an entity with a clear vested interest in developing the port, but it is not good enough that no one else can oversee the port’s development and how it will fit into the plans for greater public amenities. For example, the company has plans to stack containers in what will be a deeply intrusive area of the Poolbeg Peninsula, impacting visually and in every other way on walkers on the strand and people who are using the lovely nature reserve at Irishtown. It is not good enough that there is no entity that has a democratic oversight of the Dublin Port Company’s plans. I have engaged directly with the company, met its new management and said this to it along with making my submission. The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications has uttered a public critique of the Dublin Port Company’s role. Let us do something about it. Let us see how we can improve governance, accountability and oversight structures in respect of the development of Dublin Bay. Other countries have seen good synergies between ports and local communities. In Barcelona, the port has been greatly improved as a public amenity. We have seen the public development of swimming areas or lidos. As we are talking about swimming and bathing water, let us have a public lido. There is a strong campaign here in Dublin for a lido at George's Dock. The idea is for a lido with public access to replace the ill-fated proposed white water rafting facility. This would be an enormous amenity for us. I am old enough to remember the public baths in Blackrock. It is such a loss that we no longer have any sort of public baths along the sea line. I know there has been some development in Clontarf but nothing like those municipal baths facilities that we used to see. My mother recalls Sandymount baths on the strand and Dún Laoghaire baths. We have lost out hugely on the sort of public municipal civic amenities that we should have. Passage of the Dublin Bay Bill would enable much greater enhancement of the environmental and marine biodiversity of the bay but also the public amenity that should be our bay. I am delighted to put that on the record and am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate."	spk_203

This last-minute amendment was inserted in the Bill in the Seanad.As such, it has not undergone pre-legislative scrutiny or previous scrutiny in the Dáil. This is a valid procedural concern, first of all. All Members are conscious it is an occupational hazard of miscellaneous provisions Bills that we see a hotchpotch of different amendments to different sets of legislation. That is often to be expected but this amendment goes further. Serious and substantive concerns have been raised by organisations such as Amnesty International, the ICCL, and others, as well as by a Government Deputy just now, in respect of the import of the amendment. It would make a significant change in terms of the powers of the Data Protection Commissioner. The definition of confidential information has an overly broad ambit. It refers to: ""information the disclosure of which could, in the opinion of the Commission, reasonably be expected to prejudice the effectiveness of the performance of a relevant function"". There is a valid concern in respect of the breadth of that definition. Deputy Ó Riordáin referred to Max Schrems, who is well known as a litigant on these issues. He, along with his colleague, Professor Herwig Hofmann, reached out to us to outline their concerns that the amendment would, in effect, allow the DPC to single-handedly declare procedures before it confidential, even where no commercially sensitive material is discussed. Given that information has previously been declared confidential in several significant cases here, there is a further concern that putting this in place would amount to a departure from the European Union common approach whereby such information is usually available. In addition, there is a concern that it would conflict with and violate the constitutional provisions on freedom of expression. That concern has already been raised by a Government Deputy, as well as with many Deputies by the ICCL. The Minister must address the concern that this would make DPC decision-making more opaque and could damage the flow of information between the DPC and peers across the European Union. A range of issues have been raised with us. It is unfortunate that none of us has had sufficient opportunity to consider the amendments in more detail prior to them coming to the House. In refer to the concerns that have been raised, the correspondence that I am sure the Minister of State has received and, in particular, the concerns in respect of the source of the amendment and the reason it was produced at the last minute. Who was pushing for this amendment? Why has it been tabled now? Why is the Government using a miscellaneous provisions Bill to do this in July, in the last few weeks of the term? It is an old chestnut in the Department of Justice. When I did a lot of justice debates in the Seanad, we always saw last-minute miscellaneous provisions Bills coming in. Some of them sought to make significant changes. It is not good legislative practice and all present would like it to be changed. Many of us thought it had changed. That is why it is particularly disappointing to see these amendments. Like previous speakers, I appeal to the Minister of State to withdraw the amendment and give us more opportunity to consider it and hear further about the impetus for it, from where it came and its purpose. Why are we considering the amendment now? Why was it slipped in at the last minute? The Labour Party certainly cannot support it. A number of Deputies across the House have expressed their concerns on and critique of it. It is important for the Minister of State to hear those concerns."	spk_245

I give particular credit to Ms Maeve Delargy, Ms Claire O’Connell, Mr. Pádraig Rice and their colleagues, who are in the Public Gallery to watch this debate and with whom I was outside Leinster House just a few moments ago. I also wish to mention baby Ferdia, who is less than three months old and also joined us to mark the introduction of this important Bill. In May 2015, more than 1.2 million people voted in favour of marriage equality. On Saturday, thousands, including me, marched on the streets of Dublin to mark Pride 2023 and to celebrate diversity and the vote for equality, which sent a message of a new Ireland emerging, one that was tolerant, inclusive and welcoming of LGBTQ+ people. It heralded a new era in which our country would be a forerunner for equality and a beacon of hope around the world.The marriage equality referendum was about more than just the right to marry. The will of the people and the ambition were clear. People wanted to see LGBTQ relationships and families treated equally by the State. There is now an onus on us in the Oireachtas to realise that vision and ambition but unfortunately, eight years on, we still see gaps remaining in the law. The enactment of the Children and Family Relationships Act in 2015 was a welcome step in the right direction for equality because for the first time two same-sex parents could be listed on a child's birth certificate so that LGBTQ+ headed family units became recognised by the State. However, both intended parents could only be listed on a child's birth certificate if the circumstances of birth fell within the strict parameters of the legislation. We know from research by Dr. Lydia Bracken from the University of Limerick that many children born into LGBTQ-headed families are conceived or born outside those narrow parameters and are therefore prevented from having a legal parent-child relationship, a relationship of equality, with both parents. The former Special Rapporteur for Child Protection, Professor Conor O'Mahony, produced a report in 2020 reviewing children's rights in the context of donor-assisted human reproduction and surrogacy. He pointed out that the current framework has a negative impact on children's rights to equality. At present, four categories of children born through donor-assisted human reproduction are prevented from forming a full and equal legal relationship with both their female parents. These are children conceived with a known donor prior to May 2020, children conceived in non-clinical settings, children conceived outside of Ireland and children born outside of Ireland. The place of birth and the mechanics of conception should not determine whether a child can have a full legal relationship with his or her parents. There are no legal, ethical or policy reasons for children not getting full and equal family rights. The Bill I am presenting today seeks to remedy this situation for all of the children in each of those four areas. It offers a process whereby an application can be made to court to ensure the granting of a declaration of parentage and it introduces a presumption of maternity to offer equality to children born within both opposite-sex and same-sex couples. It also introduces a paramountcy principle to ensure that in all court applications under the Children and Family Relationships Act, the best interests of the child will be the paramount consideration. Finally, it rights the wrong of the exclusion of the use of known donors from retrospective declarations of parentage which was based, in the Labour Party's view, on a faulty legal premise that parentage could only be transferred if the genetic father was unknown. These may seem or sound like minor changes but in reality, the passage of this legislation and the granting of full parentage would have a profound impact on children and parents, particularly when children are sick, need to establish parentage, require passports and when it comes to tax or inheritance status. The Bill will also provide important legal confirmation of what is a practical reality and would end the legal limbo whereby hundreds of children are left with no way to establish a legal relationship with both of their parents who love and care for them daily and who are, at present, so-called legal strangers. The Government's Assisted Human Reproduction Bill, currently on Committee Stage in the Dáil, could have been the ideal vehicle to address the lacuna in the law that this Bill seeks to resolve. As it stands however, we have seen delays with that Bill and no move by the Government to introduce the necessary amendments. That is why I am introducing this Bill. I want to work with the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government to ensure that the provisions in this Bill are made law, either through amendments to a Government Bill or by means of a stand-alone Bill. Otherwise, the equality the people voted for in 2015 will not be realised and babies like Ferdia will not have the legal equal status to which they should be entitled in our law.	spk_103

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-06-22	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_28	This morning I want to raise with the Minister serious concerns around child protection and children's welfare that have been highlighted in a report released today by UCD's sexual exploitation research programme, SERP. The study is about young women and children in State care and in residential care homes and it makes for very distressing reading. It provides a very alarming account of the targeting and sexual exploitation of children and teenagers in State care. The exploitation is being carried out by co-ordinated gangs. The harrowing findings in this research detail cases of girls being taken by taxi from residential care homes to hotels where they were then sexually exploited and abused. The Minister might have heard Ruth Breslin speak on the matter this morning. The report's authors describe an appalling vista of cars lining up at night outside State-funded and run residential care homes, waiting for young women and girls to come out so they can be taken away. The abuse appears to be systematic and orchestrated. It is an appalling finding. What is also appalling is the perception that emerges from within the study that authorities have grown “tired” of dealing with so-called “problematic” young girls in care being reported missing. That is quite simply not good enough. These girls are at a high risk of sexual exploitation and abuse. Indeed, Tusla has accepted that it failed to keep children safe. It has said this in part due to an insufficient supply of residential places to allow children at risk to move elsewhere to a place of greater safety. Many years ago, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, I used to represent children in State care. There was a real scarcity then of residential places to keep children safe in these situations. We are now a prosperous country. I have listened to the Minister outline the benefits of prosperity and what is effectively full employment. It is appalling therefore that in 2023 we are still seeing a lack of places where children can be kept safe. My first question echoes that posed by Tanya Ward, CEO of the Children's Rights Alliance, who has asked in response to this report how many cases of suspected abuse of children in State care have been passed on to Tusla or to the Garda. Has the Government been monitoring these awful cases? Does the Government’s reported new focus on poverty and child poverty in particular include these concerns in its scope? As Minister for Finance, how does he propose to address the funding problems reported by Tusla, which are leaving children so exposed to exploitation? I heard the Minister announce earlier today that every worker in the State will receive a tax cut in the budget this October. How about we guarantee instead that every child in the State will receive an appropriate home, a place of safety? This Government has an appalling record also on child homelessness. Some years ago, the former Deputy and Minister of State, Jan O'Sullivan, introduced the homeless families Bill, which would prioritise the rights of children at risk of homelessness. Will the Minister address the needs of homeless children in a meaningful way by accepting our Bill? What does the Minister propose to do in response to today’s report by UCD’s SERP centre?	spk_204

That is very welcome. Clearly the focus of this report is a child's right to be safe and a child's right to have a safe home. A government that was serious about guaranteeing that right for every child should be prioritising moving children out of homelessness and should be prioritising not only addressing these very stark findings on children in residential care but also addressing the real crisis facing the thousands of children who are currently in homelessness. That should be the key priority above and beyond tax cuts. Issues relating to discrimination against children go more broadly than this. Back in December the Joint Committee on Gender Equality recommended a constitutional referendum to provide for a more inclusive definition of family to cover families that are not just based on marriage - for example, families with same-sex parents who are not married and families headed by single parents. What is the Government doing on that referendum on the inclusive definition of family with a focus on ensuring that children in non-constitutionally protected families are receiving appropriate protections and rights? It is again about that focus on a child's right and a child's right to safety. My questions are on a constitutional referendum and Labour's homeless families Bill.	spk_206

This is an issue that was anxiously anticipated by those living in unsafe Celtic tiger-era homes.

What we are seeing is a chronic failure of delivery which has compounded housing distress for so many people and so many families. I am thinking of two particular families I am dealing with at the moment. One comprises a father and daughter who is a wheelchair user. The father is renting a second-floor studio that is inaccessible. He has to carry his daughter up a narrow and unsafe staircase each time they come home. He has answered several hundred advertisements on  The other family is a mother and her two young children. She says her mind has gone to a very dark place due to her inability to secure a safe, affordable home for herself and her children that is near to her parents for whom she is a carer. These are just two of the families. I know all of us in the House hear from families with similar distressing stories and experiences because the chronic housing shortage is causing real suffering. Upon taking office in December, the Taoiseach pledged to go all out and take a ""let's do everything"" approach to housing. The Tánaiste said we have turned a corner on the crisis. The Taoiseach is on record as saying that we are at least on the cusp of turning a corner. The reality is that the Government is nowhere near the corner. It continues to move at a snail's pace with a real failure to deliver. It is more focused on policy launches than the physical delivery of homes. I will give some specific examples. Last August, the Government came under pressure when leaks exposed the lack of measures for renters in the budget. In response, the Minister announced a €500 renters' tax credit. The Government was warned then that this would not deliver the affordability and security of tenure that renters need and that would have been better brought about by, for example, the Labour Party's renters' rights Bill, which the Government did not oppose. It went ahead with the credit and news broke last week that half of renters have still not claimed that credit. Clearly it was not the measure that renters needed. In March, the Government lifted the temporary no fault eviction ban without any evidence or any contingency plan in place. It then announced another sticking plaster, a first refusal scheme for renters where the landlord is selling. It was warned that it would do nothing for the majority of people who receive an eviction notice. Incredibly, three months later, we still have no detail on how the scheme will work. I am still hearing from families desperate to buy their homes and they cannot do so. We continue to see missed building targets, unspent departmental budgets and rising homelessness. Will the Taoiseach accept that the renters' credit was the wrong measure and instead pass legislation to protect renters? Will the Taoiseach say when the first refusal scheme will actually come into effect? When will the legislation even be published? What is the blockage on delivery in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage?"	spk_16
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-06-20	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	The Taoiseach has listed a multitude of schemes but we see a yawning gap in the delivery of homes as a result of those schemes, which is the issue. It is an issue for everyone, including for renters and, as the Taoiseach has acknowledged, for those who wish to buy homes too. We see the report today that single first-time buyers must earn at least €67,000 a year in order to even qualify for a mortgage. We see single people locked out of homeownership and we see renters in crisis, yet the Government is failing to spend the full budget for housing. Last year, it failed to spend 25% of the social and affordable housing budget. The total spend on housing amounted to €1 billion less than the budgetary allocation. Given the scale of the crisis, which the Taoiseach has acknowledged, why are these budgets going unspent? Will he redirect funds into, for example, recruiting more construction workers to ensure increased capacity? Will he cut the red tape and enable local authorities to build homes, as they did before at a time when we saw really serious numbers of homes being built every year?

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-06-20	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I want to raise the issue of early years education and childcare. We know urgent reforms are needed. We still have fees that are too high, a lack of availability of places, and staff and workers who are low-paid. The Taoiseach's comments at the weekend appeared to undermine the Government's commitment to a reduction in costs and showed a complete lack of understanding of the severity of this issue and how serious it is for so many parents. Is the Government committed to a significant reduction in costs? Can we see at last a publicly funded universal and affordable childcare and early years scheme? It is something that Labour Women and myself have consistently campaigned for. The State provides universal public education to all children from junior infants to sixth year, but inexplicably parents are left struggling in preschool years. We find so many parents who simply cannot access affordable childcare and early years places for their children. This burden is felt predominantly by women. It is keeping women out of the workforce in some cases, so it is time for the Government to commit to introducing significant reforms in childcare.	spk_72

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-06-15	dail	33	Flood Insurance Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_40	I am glad to support this Bill. I will speak a little about its history, which the Minister of State also referred to. It is important that this issue be addressed and it is disappointing to see a further delay being proposed by the Government, given this legislation has had a long genesis, as the Deputy said. The background to this, as we all know, is that the planet is getting hotter. Unfortunately, severe weather events are becoming more extreme and frequent and sea levels are rising. In fact, recent rates for the relative sea level rise in Dublin have been greater than the global average by a factor of two. Numerous studies have recorded that sea levels along the coast of my constituency of Dublin Bay South and the Minister of State's constituency of Dún Laoghaire are rising faster than anticipated. These frightening features of life in a climate crisis have real and significant effects for people. One of these effects is on homeowners, of course, who must now deal with damage caused by flooding. Numerous constituents of mine in Sandymount, Ringsend and Irishtown and along the docklands have contacted me because they cannot obtain flood insurance. This has had a significant impact on the terms of their mortgages, aside from the obvious disadvantage they are at in the event that their homes are flooded, which would cause immense distress and damage. Anyone I know who has had a house flooded has suffered far more than in the context of the cost incurred.This is a serious issue. We are in a housing crisis, where we have a chronic housing shortage and need to build more homes, including homes in coastal areas. I have pushed for greater urgency around the delivery of necessary housing on the former Irish Glass Bottle site in Poolbeg. At this point, when we are building along the coastline, and rightly so, the failure to take responsibility for people facing a risk of flooding in these circumstances is unacceptable. Some months ago, I asked the Minister for Finance his plans to reform flood insurance and whether he will act so that people have cover where they live in areas with demountable flood defences. In response, the Minister gave a rather unsatisfactory reply, essentially referring to the provision of insurance cover as a commercial matter for insurance companies providing the service. He essentially washed his hands of the issue. As with supermarket pricing, housing policy and energy costs, the Government is taking far too hands off of an approach to the private market. It is non-interventionist, even where we see intervention as being important and necessary. That is evident in the amendment brought forward by the Government today, which seeks to delay the Bill. As I said, I will return to the genesis of the Bill. The reality is that there is an urgency to this issue for many people who have been affected, in particular around the unavailability of insurance. My Labour Party colleague in Pembroke, in Dublin Bay South, Councillor Dermot Lacey, has raised the issue of flood defences, a related issue, over many years. He cited the real difficulty with getting procedures and defences moved on swiftly. Much work is needed. We have called on the OPW to take a stronger role in intervening in Sandymount where the flood wall is too low and action needs to be taken. We are very anxious to see these works carried out, in addition to the installation of the necessary cycle routes. All of these are infrastructural matters which must be progressed in tandem with a more sympathetic policy approach from Government and, indeed, insurance companies. This, of course, is not just an issue in this constituency. My Labour Party colleague in Dublin City Council, Councillor Declan Meenagh, a councillor in Cabra-Glasnevin, has been very active on the matter. He has said that insurance companies cannot have it both ways. They will not insure where they believe there are inadequate flood defences and where adequate flood defences have been installed they will not insure because there was flooding in the past. It is a catch-22 situation for many householders. As is the case across many parts of Dublin Bay South, parts of Dublin Central have been prone to flooding. We all recall the iconic photos of some of the floods in East Wall, North Strand, Clonliffe and Cabra, which are particularly vulnerable areas. While problems with flooding were identified and addressed in some of those areas following those very serious floods, nevertheless insurance companies simply will not include flooding in an insurance premium in many cases. Due to the fact certain areas have flooded in the past, they said they remain no-go areas for insurance companies. They are acting with total disregard for flood defence works where they have been carried out. I understand some companies have even refused to do a risk assessment on the new set of circumstances. These are issues that impinge very severely on homeowners. That is why the Bill is not, in fact, the first time we have seen this issue come before the House. The Minister, Deputy McGrath, produced a Bill on this in 2016, as was pointed out. The purpose of it would be to ensure that people who live, work, reside or have businesses in areas where flood relief schemes are implemented would be able to get insurance cover. My colleague in this campaign, Deputy Sean Sherlock, sought last year to resubmit the former Fianna Fáil Bill on flood insurance. He was overtaken by Deputy Brady at the time.  The point is that there is a confluence of views on the need to introduce this sort of legislation. The Government is not opposing the Bill; rather, it is simply seeking to delay it. That shows the cross-party support there is in principle for this issue. I wish to reiterate that while I have referred to various areas and communities in Dublin which are prone to flooding, of course Deputy Sherlock referenced the flooding that took place in Fermoy in 2021. He pointed out that when incidents like that have occurred, relief works have not succeeded and there has been a breakdown. He spoke about the need in those sorts of scenarios to ensure that insurance companies will cover homeowners. The flood protection measures that have been carried out in towns like Fermoy and Mallow are still not enough to give people the protection they need for flood insurance cover. That is why we need to pass the Bill. I welcome this debate. I am very happy to offer the support of the Labour Party for the Bill. As I said, it is a Bill which comes on the back of previous legislation from Government parties and ourselves. We are glad to see it brought forward. However, we are disappointed the Government is simply putting in place a delaying mechanism, in particular when there is support in principle for the Bill. I would welcome if the Minister of State could set out the proactive steps she will take to address the issue if the Government amendment is passed and it is another year before we can get back to debating this Bill. Beyond playing wait and see with the European Union, could constructive and meaningful engagement be carried out? I tabled a parliamentary question on this matter. In the reply the Minister for Finance told me there is ongoing engagement, but we are not seeing any results from that engagement. The concern for the homeowners affected is that engagement is pointless if it is not delivering change and has a real impact on those who are affected. The Minister said that in order to address the issue of flood coverage levels in areas with demountable defences, continued engagement with all relevant stakeholders is key. We absolutely agree with that, but it should not be used as a delaying tactic. Can the Minister of State say precisely what form of engagement, impact and effect that engagement will have?	spk_468

He will be greatly missed for his immense contribution to Irish music, society and culture. I also want to express my sympathies on behalf of Labour to the family of John Murphy. John was one of two men who suffered severe injuries at a Cork Stryker plant in April and he sadly died last week. Our thoughts are with his family and friends too. Last night, in an announcement that was a surprise, it is fair to say, and a shock, 650 workers at Tara Mines were informed that they would be laid off temporarily. I express solidarity with all those involved, not just the 650 directly affected but the maybe 2,000 people whose livelihoods we know will be indirectly impacted as a result of what has happened. Management has cited inflation as a factor underpinning this decision. Inflation affects workers too. As Michael Fitzgerald, a SIPTU shop steward for the miners, said, ""The cost of living is hurting everyone. It might be hurting the company, but it's hurting us as well."" He is right. Management at Tara Mines has been happy to capitalise on the hard work of its employees in Louth and Meath, yet when times get tough, it has socialised its debts and put its workers out to pasture. The Government is presiding over a social welfare system that is not fit to protect workers from the worst impacts of the loss of livelihood. This is because there is no meaningful, modern scheme to support and keep them in work.  This is the latest in the series of layoffs since the Minister, Deputy Coveney, took office in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It has been stated that the layoffs at Twitter sparked a positive change in thinking in Government Buildings on workers' rights. I should hope so, given that workers' rights receive no stand-alone treatment in the programme for Government. We know that more is needed to support workers in these situations. I want to outline two constructive proposals from Labour and SIPTU. I would like to hear the Taoiseach's response to both. The first is the reform of our welfare system, which is out of kilter with those in mainstream Europe. As Adrian Kane of SIPTU stated, the workforce at Tara Mines have the normal outgoings that so many are struggling with in the cost-of-living crisis, including high rents and mortgage payments and grocery, energy and childcare costs. These workers face a huge drop in income when they go on social welfare, as anyone who does the sums will see. In our submission to the public consultation on jobseeker's benefit, Labour called for a welfare system which would index workers' income up to 60% for six months minimum, with a floor beneath which no one can fall. Will the Government implement that proposal as part of the budget? Second, I ask him to answer another call, which Deputy Nash, Senator Marie Sherlock and all of us in Labour have been making, for the introduction of a short-term working scheme modelled on the employee wage subsidy scheme and the German "	spk_69

I share his hope that this will be a short-term temporary layoff for the workers affected. Again, my thoughts are with the workers. The Taoiseach has not answered my question on the proposal for a short-term working scheme. Indeed, is it a proposal that has been put forward across the labour movement. I would like a clear response on that. We have seen it used elsewhere to protect workers in this situation. I have a further question. The Taoiseach stated that there has been engagement between Tara Mines and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for some months now. I have a specific question about the nature of that engagement. Did Tara Mines seek forms of assistance from Government in the past six months, including under the Ukraine enterprise crisis scheme, a scheme that the Taoiseach signed off on last year? We need to know what State supports the company sought and obtained. The company cannot be allowed to pull the plug on its workers.At the very least, we need a concrete commitment that employees' existing terms and conditions will be retained when they go back to work in what we hope will be a very short time. Has the Government communicated that to the company yet? If not, will it do so? We need to see a response on the short-term working scheme. We believe that this is the way in which the Government can very much step forward and offer concrete means of support to workers in the awful scenario of what we hope will be only a temporary layoff.	spk_71

My colleague, Senator Wall, has pointed out that without rooting out that culture, we will see an ongoing recruitment and retention crisis in the Defence Forces. The Taoiseach and Tánaiste have met with the Women of Honour.

It is the latest in a series of Opposition motions and proposals to address the housing disaster, the chronic housing shortage and the Government's failure to address it. We in Labour have put forward constructive proposals of our own to begin the path to secure and affordable housing and to effective provision and delivery. Among the measures we have proposed is a Bill to prioritise the needs of children in homelessness, legislation the Government parties supported when in opposition. We have introduced a Bill to provide an evidence base for the lifting of the eviction ban we called on Government to adopt. Unfortunately, all our proposals have been met with a dismissive response from Government, very much like the dismissive response to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's motion. That is extremely disappointing given the scale of the crisis we face. Now more than ever we need cross-party action. We need to see ambition and urgency from Government and we need to see a constructive approach taken by Government in adopting some of the proposals, ideas and measures we put forward to address this catastrophic situation. We need that level of collaborative work because we have a record number of people in homelessness. Last week's figures show 12,259 people are in homelessness, including thousands of children. Multiple generations have given up on ever being able to own a home. Many younger and older people are stuck in an exploitative private rental market with no options left. One renter in my constituency asked me in despair, ""How am I, a man in my 60s, supposed to get a mortgage?"" He has been evicted from his private rental property. That is the reality. With a pension system based on the assumption that pensioners will be homeowners, will have paid off the mortgage and will not be renting, this housing crisis is in reality a ticking time bomb for an older generation, which we are seeing looming ever closer. From the census figures released this week we know that the proportion of owner-occupied dwellings continues to fall, down from almost 70% to 66% in the 11 years since the census of 2011. Among young people these figures are even more stark, with hundreds of thousands continuing to live in their childhood bedrooms into their 20s, 30s and even 40s. This is not surprising because house prices have skyrocketed, rising well above inflation and material costs and well above any increase in wages. There is particular pressure on home ownership in Ireland because in reality it is the only method of achieving housing security for people in this country. When the Government made the unconscionable decision earlier this year to lift the temporary no-fault eviction ban, that decision took away the only other form of housing security that had been available. It meant that thousands of renters who have done nothing wrong were set to lose their homes. They are living in fear of losing their homes. With home ownership becoming increasingly more unaffordable and social housing lists extraordinary oversubscribed, individuals and families are locked out of housing security. The Government should have continued the eviction ban until there were real options for housing security elsewhere, but instead it pulled the rug out from under renters and chose to prioritise landlord profits over people's lives. One might think that in pulling security away from renters, Government would at least have sought to ensure that security through home ownership would be easily available but that has not been the case. We have seen massive underspending on housing. I am glad the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has joined us now. The failure by Government to deliver the necessary levels of State investment of public funding for the building of homes has held back the prospect for many people of having the security of home ownership. The failure to deliver housing at a time of massive budget surpluses proves that it is ideology and not the economy that is holding back necessary massive State investment. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have been over-reliant on an ideology that expects the private market and private developers to deliver housing, but we have no evidence that has been the case. Indeed, the evidence all points to the opposite, which is that the private sector has not delivered affordable housing at the levels required. When the Government refers back to the glory days of building of houses in large numbers, it fails to remember that it was it was the State through local authorities that delivered the affordable housing in the 20th century. It is extraordinary that the Government continues to remain reluctant to provide the necessary levels of State intervention to resolve this crisis. Secure and affordable housing is a human right and the Government has failed to vindicate this right. During the Covid pandemic, we saw how the State could mobilise and invest resources to intervene for the common good to save people from job losses and poverty. However, in the midst of a housing crisis, we are not seeing that level of State commitment. Instead, we are seeing a rollback on private agreements to deliver social housing. Yesterday, I mentioned to the Taoiseach the Irish Glass Bottle site in Poolbeg in my constituency, which was set to deliver in the first phase a significant number of affordable homes. That first phase will now only produce 25. The Taoiseach has said that he would engage with the Minister to see what has gone wrong with the site. Labour councillors were part of the really strong campaign to deliver significant levels of social and affordable housing for local communities in Poolbeg. It has been deeply disappointing, first, to see the massive delays and now to see this rollback on the numbers of affordable homes to be delivered. Poolbeg is an example of what happens in when private developers are left to their own devices and when the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage does not intervene. Instead of ensuring delivery of affordable homes through State investment, the Government has funnelled money into private developers' pockets and into schemes such as help to buy that have done little to make homeownership accessible. I see the Minister indicating he disagrees, but the reality is that the independent review of help to buy commissioned by the Department of Finance pointed out that successful recipients have higher-than-average incomes and that the scheme has socially regressive outcomes. A supposedly fundamental element of Government's policy to encourage home ownership has simply not been successful. It has wasted public money that could be better spent on the provision of affordable housing. Again and again we in opposition across different parties have put forward constructive proposals for addressing the housing crisis. When we do so, we have been met with smugness, a reliance on figures from Government that do not add up and a certain fatalism. It is almost as if Government is despairing that anything can be done to address the housing crisis. The reality is that things can be done. Massive State investment and massive ambition for change could deliver. We in Labour put forward a programme for delivery of 1 million homes over ten years, based on the Government's own projections using ESRI data, IBEC proposals and constructive proposals from NGOs such as Threshold and Focus Ireland. We put forward this ambitious proposal in the hope that there would be engagement from Government. Rather than engaging, Ministers have spent their time saying why this cannot be done instead of looking on how it can be done and should be done to meet the real needs of individuals and families in this country. Why does the Government care more about political point-scoring on housing than working with others in opposition to find constructive solutions to the housing crisis? We in Labour say it is time for change. The Minister should accept this constructive motion with its strong proposals. Government also needs to reinstate the eviction ban to provide security while we revolutionise the housing sector, and while we rapidly scale up State investment to ensure delivery of the secure affordable homes that families and individuals across the country so badly need."	spk_35

I commend Ms Maura Butler and her colleagues on it. I express my sympathy and that of my Labour colleagues to all those families affected by this dreadful phenomenon. An féidir leis an Aire a admháil gur botún a bhí ann? Can he admit that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage made a mistake in failing to extend the temporary no-fault eviction ban? Can the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform admit that lifting the ban without evidence for doing so was in fact misguided and that the risk taken in doing so without evidence and without providing a safety net for renters has not paid off, the result being that we are now seeing the realisation of the worst-case scenario? Earlier we debated homeownership and how to achieve home security for families and households; however, by lifting the eviction ban the Government signalled to renters that they were on their own when it comes to housing security. There was no safety net or contingency plan for the thousands of renters who now risk entering homelessness through no fault of their own. They are in a real rental nightmare. I am thinking of families like those in my own constituency – parents who are facing eviction and desperately seeking a new home but who cannot tell their children they will very soon be losing their homes until they get through the State examinations. These families in my constituency are not alone. The latest figures, published by the Residential Tenancies Board just yesterday, record an increase in eviction notices. We now know that between January and March this year, 4,753 notices to quit were issued. The vast majority of these pertained to no-fault evictions. Families and individuals are being evicted in their droves, not because they have failed to pay rent or have engaged in antisocial behaviour but because their homes are commodified for a market that does not care for their welfare. Indeed, it is not the role of the market, nor that of private landlords, to keep people in housing security; it is the role of the State and the Government to provide people with security in their homes. The Government has failed to do this. In 2021, we in Labour introduced a renters' rights Bill. During the debate on that Bill, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, committed to examining the proposals in it. One was to restrict no-fault evictions. This modest measure is treated or described as extreme in this country. It is not often that we in Labour have cause to commend the Tory Party across the pond, but the Minister may have seen that the British housing secretary, Mr. Michael Gove, recently unveiled legislation to end no-fault evictions there, namely the Tories' Renters (Reform) Bill. As even the Tories know, it is not radical to suggest that families should not lose their homes through no fault of their own. If the Tories can take the risk, the Irish Government should be similarly brave. Will it adopt our renters' rights Bill or at least match the ambition of the British Conservative Party and adopt policies to end no-fault evictions? Does the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform accept that successive homelessness and eviction data published since the end of March have shown that the Government was wrong to lift the ban? Will he accept our call to at least reinstate a temporary ban until homelessness rates reduce for four consecutive months?	spk_87

The State exams are beginning next week and we all wish those sitting their junior and leaving certificate exams the best, but it is a particularly difficult time for the parents of children who are sitting those exams who are among the more than 4,700 people who have received notices to quit and, therefore, lack housing security. Last Friday's homelessness data showed that more than 12,000 people, including more than 3,500 children, are in homelessness. We know these official figures mask the number of hidden homeless, for example, those couch surfing or bunking in with relatives. It is simply not good enough for families and their children who are sitting State exams that we have this level of housing insecurity as a direct result of a Government decision to lift a no-fault eviction ban that was providing much-needed housing security to thousands of renters. I appeal to the Minister to adopt Labour's Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill 2021.	spk_89

Wen mortgages and rents are at an all-time high and the cost of everyday basics continues to rise, this is very difficult news for all those affected, many in my constituency of Dublin Bay South. I express my solidarity and that of my Labour Party colleagues with all of those who are once again in the dark as to whether they will continue have jobs in a few months' time. Along with the cuts previously announced, it now seems that 20% of Meta's total workforce in Ireland is likely to be made redundant. That is a significant proportion. The Tánaiste knows that this forms a pattern in the sector. We are seeing a practice being embedded whereby big tech companies hire employees  As with many companies in the sector, Meta does not recognise its workers' trade union, which is the Financial Services Union. This means the terms of the redundancies will be agreed by way of consultation, with little, if any, real bargaining power for the workers, as opposed to being negotiated with unions through collective bargaining processes. Yesterday, in reply to my questions on this matter in anticipation of the job losses, the Taoiseach pointed out that 2.6 million people are at work in Ireland, which is very welcome of course, and that people are employed in increasing numbers in the tech sector, notwithstanding the spate of cuts. It is the quality and security of the jobs that is at issue and that is cause for concern for so many people and for the Labour Party. We know we are in a period of very welcome economic growth in Ireland, but that growth will not last forever. There is real concern about the sustainability of employment, not only in big tech but also in various other sectors. We see very concerning news that Germany, the EU's largest economy, is now in a technical recession. We know we cannot take for granted that uninterrupted growth will continue. We know that it will not. What needs to happen during a period of relative stability here is to see the necessary investment in public services and infrastructure such as housing, childcare and facilities for children with special needs and autistic children, as we heard promised yesterday by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, during the debate on the Private Members' motion tabled by the Labour Party. We also need a concerted programme of measures to improve and strengthen workers' rights and to ensure that companies have obligations and not just options. We need to see the Government put in place mechanisms to ensure rebalancing and measures to increase wages. We need to see the Government take up the call made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, today to increase to the minimum wage.

We all share that concern. We are all thinking of the workers and their families who are awaiting the news as to who will be affected by the announcement from Meta. The question for the Government is what to do next in the context of a massive budget surplus. Certainly kite flying from Ministers in the Tánaiste's partner party in government has not been helpful to people now looking for certainty as to what sort of protections will be in place and what measures will be adopted by the Government in the forthcoming budget. The reality is that workers' rights were not important enough for the Government to get a stand-alone section in the programme for Government. Now we are seeing workers being left without the right to have recognition for their trade union representatives in the context of collective redundancies. I call on the Tánaiste to commit the Government to enshrining a right to organise and to collective bargaining, along with heeding the calls from ICTU by paying apprentices and minimum wage workers a living wage.

We know that more than 770 women have travelled to Britain for abortion services that they cannot access here since we changed the law. For those women, therefore, the problem has not been solved, nor has it been for the many women who still have to travel across counties to access services, as we see so little provision in some counties by GPs and by hospitals. I know that Deputy Bríd Smith raised this issue earlier and we will debate her Bill later. I welcomed the recommendations of the O'Shea review and called for necessary legislative changes.

I have spoken previously about hearing, back in 2021, what was a very poignant programme on the BBC World Service, which will have been heard by other insomniacs who tune into the radio late at night. On that programme, a really haunting recording of the song of the ivory-billed woodpecker was played. It was haunting because at that point it was thought that this was a bird that had become extinct and that from now on, it was only going to be possible to hear its song as a recording. This bird had been widespread in the south eastern US and elsewhere. We have had some good news in recent weeks, with reports that this bird has now been seen again in some parts of the US. However, the very tragic threat of extinction faces so many species. In Ireland, the iconic song of the corncrake is no longer widely heard. A paper published this week by researchers in Queen’s University, Belfast, finds that half of species on Earth are currently undergoing population decline. Furthermore, 33% of species currently considered safe by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature are, in fact, declining towards risk of extinction. This is driven by human behaviour. We know it is the result of human activity. It speaks to the arrogance of humankind that often we do not think of ourselves as living in an ecosystem, but as separate from the natural world. Of course, that is not the case. We rely on flora and fauna for our food, our way of life and our sanitation. We know that ecological breakdown will have catastrophic effects for us and for other species too. That is why it is so important for the Government to urgently adopt the recommendations of the Citizens’ Assembly on Biodiversity Loss. I pay tribute to all the participants and to the Chair of the Assembly, Dr. Aoibhinn Ní Shúilleabháin. I am happy to back the call of the environmental pillar, a national environmental umbrella group, for an Oireachtas committee with all-party membership to consider the report of the citizens’ assembly, to make recommendations as to its implementation and to devise an action plan. This committee must be adequately resourced to bring in expert advisers and to move swiftly forward to ensure that we see concerted, cross-party consensus on action on biodiversity. I had the privilege of chairing the Joint Committee on Gender Equality last year. That committee showed how we can bring forward an action plan based on recommendations of citizen's assemblies. It is that sort of thoughtful process that is required for complicated and multifaceted issues like gender equality and biodiversity loss. It is long past time that we started to view the success of our economy and our society as intrinsically linked with actions to tackle biodiversity loss. Discussions of environmental policy are often lacking consideration of biodiversity and we need to ensure more joined-up thinking on economic development, environmental sustainability and biodiversity. We need to see the sort of combined approach to the economy that President Michael D. Higgins spoke about recently when he talked about the need to bring together considerations of economy, ethics and ecology when we are talking about growth. Returning to the Citizen's Assembly on Biodiversity Loss, when I saw the assembly's recommendations, I submitted parliamentary questions to each Department seeking to discover their plans to implement those recommendations which relate to their Departments. I wanted to ascertain whether there was concerted and joined-up thinking on the issue. A notable trend within the replies I received was a lack of preparedness to take on those recommendations. This really highlights the need for greater coordination across Government on biodiversity. Is the Minister satisfied that adequate action is being taken to implement the recommendations of the citizens’ assembly or even to see how they can be implemented? How does he propose to secure that implementation? In the short time remaining, I want to speak on two other issues related to biodiversity, the first of which is forestry. It is not long ago since the Save our Forests - Save our Lands coalition, which the Labour Party is glad to support, gathered outside Leinster House to voice their outrage at the deal involving Coillte and Gresham House, which facilitated the putting of public money into the wallets of private investors and vulture funds. That development really highlighted what needs to change on forestry. The Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss was clear that State-owned woodlands should be managed as a strategic, long-term national asset for the common good. Yet, as we all know, Ireland's ancient native forests have been devastated by years of unsustainable mismanagement. The Government is now meeting just one quarter of its own afforestation targets and the licensing system is in disarray. I would be grateful to hear from the Minister what he thinks will transpire as a result of the Gresham House deal in the context of the citizen's assembly recommendations. I want to talk about an issue relating to biodiversity in my constituency. It is close to my own heart. I have been pressing for some time now on the need to legislate for the creation of a statutory Dublin Bay authority to ensure that we have co-ordinated plan for the preservation and conservation of this great natural amenity on our doorstep. We know that pollution is a huge issue for this valuable amenity. It affects those of us who swim in the sea regularly, with outflows of sewage, but it also has a hugely detrimental impact on our marine life. Dublin Bay is a habitat for sea rocket, couch grass, sea lavender, brent geese, grey herons, seals and so many other types of plant and animal. Some mechanism to ensure greater co-ordination and joined-up thinking in order to protect marine biodiversity is essential. I was glad to receive cross-party support for the Dublin Bay Bill, which I introduced in this House in December, but the clock is ticking. I am anxious that the Minister and the Minister of State would take the initiative on this, as promised, before the end of this Government's mandate. It is vitally important. We need a statutory agency with democratic governance and really effective powers to intervene to protect our bay. That need has actually become more urgent since the publication of Dublin Port's plans, which I know the Minister has been very critical of, and rightly so. Dublin Port has a particular plan for the future of Dublin Bay that relates to the commercial interests of the port but we need to see a broader public interest coming into focus here to ensure protection of the biodiversity in the bay.	spk_294

For those of us who campaigned for many decades to see abortion law change, it was a momentous result. It showed the compassion and empathy people in Ireland had for the reality of crisis pregnancy and the real lived experiences of women and girls across Ireland. The key issue, reflecting on it five years on, is to ensure that abortion healthcare is available and accessible to all women and girls who need it. That is crucial. In the years since we legislated to enable legal abortion to be carried out here, 775 women have travelled to England for abortion services there. This clearly illustrates that, as the O'Shea report so clearly puts it, there remain unnecessary barriers to access for women. We need to address those barriers. I commend Marie O'Shea and her colleagues who carried out the very careful and comprehensive research and review into the operation of the legislation. Those colleagues include Dr. Catherine Conlon, who has a long track record of careful research on this issue. The recommendations and findings of the O'Shea review are sensible and clear and they would greatly enhance access to abortion care in Ireland. They are very much in keeping with the submission the Labour Party made to the review process. We called for a number of operational and legal changes to be made to ensure increased access. I note the Minister's comments about the operational changes that are needed and which he said will get under way. That is very welcome to hear. In particular, it is welcome to hear the Minister's commitment to ensuring that all maternity hospitals will provide abortion care services, as indeed they should.It is disturbing to see that still, only 11 of 19 hospitals currently are providing these services. This is a real shortfall and again shows the serious barriers to access for many women. We also know that not enough GPs are providing access to early termination services and this again is a matter of genuine concern. We must see and I urge the Minister to ensure that we have stronger and quicker Government action in this regard. I also welcome the Minister's announcement regarding the safe access zones legislation. This is welcome and we have been looking for it for some time. Two clear legislative changes are required to address what are serious barriers to access. One concerns the three-day waiting period. In our submission, we made the point that this aspect is medically unnecessary and creates significant barriers, especially for women living outside urban areas in places where there is limited access to providers and for those financially or socially vulnerable or disadvantaged. As Marie O'Shea has pointed out, this three-day waiting period can in practice be a wait of four days, five days or even longer. This is an unnecessary barrier and should be removed. The issue of decriminalisation is also urgent. Having spoken with doctors and abortion providers, this is still a serious chilling factor for medical practitioners. The criminalisation provision in the legislation is not necessary medically and it is certainly not the norm in other medical procedures. It should, therefore, be removed. Regarding the Government's proposed amendment, I agree with all my colleagues on this side of the House who have pointed out that a year is too long to wait. We must see the Joint Committee on Health take on board the recommendations of the O'Shea review and we must move forward and debate this issue as an Oireachtas but we do not need a full year to do so. As we have the careful and well-reasoned recommendations from the O'Shea review, let us see the Government move swiftly on these to ensure women have access to the abortion healthcare we so badly need and to give full effect to the vote of the people five years ago today."	spk_349

I do not think anyone in this House is comfortable to hear about autistic children being denied access to education or to vital supports. I do not think any of us is comfortable hearing the deep concern and despair from parents at the prospects for their children, if they are autistic, as they move into young adulthood. There is a pronounced lack of supports and services for these children. It appears to us in the Labour Party that nobody is treating this like the house is on fire. The buck stops with the Government. I welcome the fact that the Government is not opposing our motion. That said, we need to see action in respect of this matter. We hear so many times from younger and older autistic adults of how they were failed as children and of their concerns that autistic children are still being failed by the education system. I commend and thank the national organisations that are working to strengthen and improve services. I refer to groups like AsIAm and Families Unite for Services and Support, FUSS, Ireland. I also refer to groups in my own constituency, namely, Neurodiversity Irishtown, Ringsend and Pearse Street, NIRP, Involve Autism D6D6W & Surrounds and the brilliant Ranelagh Rockets that are part of Ranelagh Gaels GAA club. Thanks to their campaigning and the passion of so many parents and so many communities, we are starting to see progress in schooling. That is acknowledged. I see classes in St. Mary's National School, Belmont Avenue, Templeogue College and the new Libermann Spiritan School in Templeogue. These improvements will be a lifeline for children and parents, but we are coming from a very low base. From all around the country I hear stories and experiences from people like those involved in the brilliant Rainbow Club in Cork or the Special Needs Action Group I met in Athy in Kildare on Monday. These are groups of parents who have come together because they are in despair at the lack of services offered to them and their children. We are seeing a real failure in the context of the section 37A process, which could and should be used to secure education places and additional special classes. Since 2020, we have not seen this process being used. Three years is a long time in the life of a child when there is an established need among so many children in so many areas. To give another example of failure, more than one in three approved posts in the CDNTs is lying vacant. Children are languishing on waiting lists for assessments for years. That is one of the issues we focus on in our motion. We recognise that getting an assessment is not a panacea either, as parents will be well aware. Unspent budgets and a staffing crisis across CDNTs means that the only meaningful effect of being seen is that a child is no longer recorded as awaiting care in official figures. In reality, that child will continue to not receive any adequate service. Yesterday, I hosted a group from Ukrainian Action Ireland and heard about the experience of Ukrainians here who inform us that parents of neurodiverse children in the Ukrainian community are dismayed at the lack of services for their children. We hear from staff who are experiencing burnout and leaving for better paid jobs. As Deputy Smith stated, the Labour Party sought to address this by looking to increase pay for section 39 workers and those in the community and voluntary sector. However, we are hearing about annual staff turnover rates of 80% across CDNTs and community and voluntary sector workers. There is such dismay and frustration at the lack of services and the lack of co-ordination of services. It is good to see both Ministers here. We welcome the Government's approach to our motion, but that is simply not enough. It is nice to reconnect with the familiar faces of the parents and activists in the Gallery, but I am deeply sad that there is still the need for them to come out again on this issue. We hear from parents who are exhausted from fighting for services for their children and who despair about the lack of services for young autistic people and autistic adults. It is really shameful that we are again debating this issue and that, as Cara Darmody put it so eloquently, nobody is treating this issue like the house is on fire."	spk_15
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-05-24	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_8	I want to speak with the Taoiseach about provision for children. First, I welcome the intervention by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in response to our Labour Party motion on services for autistic children and children with disabilities. I commend the Minister of State on committing to bring our Labour Party proposal to Cabinet. If six regional testing teams are not functional by 1 August, she has committed the State to paying for assessments of need of children who are waiting more than three months. That was a really important, timely, unexpected, but very welcome intervention by the Minister of State, supported by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman. I ask the Taoiseach if he can commit to that for the children and parents who were listening to the debate earlier and have heard what has been said. We acknowledge there is a recruitment crisis. We have acknowledged all of that. We have acknowledged the progress that has been made, but we need to see that sort of really effective commitment being made and being honoured by Government. We owe that to Cara and Mark Darmody, and to all of those who have been so active for so long, seeking adequate and effective interventions and services for their children. I raise another issue relating to provision for children, namely, the Barnardo's report published today, which lays bare the real impact of the cost-of-living crisis for children in Ireland. It exposes the stark reality facing so many parents across the country who are making the unthinkable decision of not to bring a sick child to the doctor because they simply cannot afford it. One parent reported being afraid to do the washing because of ESB bills. This report has confirmed what we, in the Labour Party, have been warning about for some time, that the barrage of tokenistic and untargeted measures adopted by Government were simply not enough to keep the wolf from the door for far too many. They were simply not enough for children today asking their parents if they are poor. The week in which we see the publication of this important Barnardo's report, and in which we hear from parents who are trying to get services for autistic children, also appears to mark the beginning of the budget kite-flying season. The Taoiseach has condemned the practice of the drip-feeding and kite-flying of proposals over the years, yet he and his party colleagues have been first out of the traps, calling for tax cuts in this budget and showing fundamental disrespect for their partners in government, some of whom have been very open about their critique of this. More importantly, it is disrespectful to the people in our communities across the country who are struggling to get services and to make ends meet, as Barnardo's has told us. It is disrespectful to them to see Fine Gael Ministers and Deputies testing the waters, attempting to consolidate popular support by playing politics, mooting ideas to resonate with the core vote, and insulting households trapped in poverty. Does the Taoiseach agree that it is impossible to maintain a position favouring tax cuts while leaving behind so many families and children in poverty? Does he agree that at a minimum, any tax relief in this budget must be accompanied by a meaningful increase in social welfare payments, a commitment to the living wage and, crucially, a commitment to invest budget surpluses in the provision of services for children with special needs and for children who are facing such an enormous shortfall in service provision for autism and disability services across the country at the moment?	spk_71

It is at the expense of investment in meaningful measures to tackle child poverty, which is a commitment the Taoiseach made, and yet we see more than 188,000 children living in poverty, such as those whose stories were told in the Barnardos report today. I appeal to the Taoiseach and Government to ensure the necessary investment is made. I thank the Taoiseach for engaging with me on the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte's, commitment. I thank him for saying the work is under way on that. Of course, we want to see the six regional assessment teams in place. I ask him again to ensure the necessary public investment is in place so those assessment teams are in place in order that the backlog of assessments of needs can be met in that way, and that he will abide by that timeline of 1 August given by the Minister of State which the children and their parents so desperately need.	spk_84

Indeed, many tech workers are now voting with their feet and are joining unions such as the Financial Services Union, FSU, to ensure they are protected from global forces at play in the tech industry.

I express my sympathy and solidarity on behalf of Labour with the family and young boy concerned. I hope he makes a speedy recovery. It was an appalling attack. We all join in sympathy with him and his family. Yesterday, we learned that global temperatures are likely to surge to record levels in the next five years according to the World Meteorological Organization. This rise in temperature is fuelled by heat-trapping greenhouse gases that come from our continued overreliance on fossil fuels. There is a high likelihood that temperatures will rise well above the 1.5°C limit set in the Paris Agreement to which this State signed up. We know now there is a 98% chance that at least one of the next five years will be the warmest ever recorded on this planet. Time is running out for our environment. We in Ireland - the land of rain and clouds - all too often dismiss the impact of global warming or think it will not happen to us and will not be felt here and that the effects of climate change will be felt by other people. Of course, that is not the case. The impacts will and are being felt here. In Dublin, while we are fortunate to be a stone’s throw from the sea, increasing temperatures and climate change mean that sea levels will rise and many of our seafront communities, including those in my own constituency, will be hit with destructive flooding for which we are totally unprepared. I did not come here to fearmonger or scaremonger on climate. I came here to ask the Government to do more to address the reality of climate change because Irish emissions are continuing to soar despite the looming catastrophe. According to EUROSTAT, Ireland had the largest increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union last year. It was one of just four EU countries to increase emissions annually at a time when we are all committed to reducing emissions. The Government has sought to make excuses and deflect from these figures, but the reality is that while other European countries like Finland took proactive steps to cut their usage of gas, for example, we did nothing. We knew this was coming but rather than invest in climate infrastructure that could see a reduced reliance on fossil fuels, the Government has been pouring taxpayers' money into paying for carbon credits at a time when we could be a leader in reducing reliance on gas through developing our great natural resource and developing our offshore wind capacity. We are lagging behind on that. There are actions we could be taking today to begin a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. We can reduce our reliance on gas, like they did in Finland, by ramping up our offshore wind generation capacity. Last week's option was a welcome step, but it is simply not enough. Second, we could introduce many more measures on reducing gas emissions from cars. A punitive tax on gas-guzzling SUVs, like that introduced in France, would be one practical step for which we in Labour have advocated, just as we advocated for a €9 climate ticket that would be valid on all public transport and could take thousands of cars off the roads and reduce costs for families and households while proactively reducing our emissions. I ask the Tánaiste to take up these constructive steps that would have a real impact on enabling us to meet our climate targets.	spk_214

Equally, we are hugely critical of the fact that the Government has missed targets. There is a lack of urgency to tackle this worrying rise in emissions from Ireland. This is happening at a time of record budget surpluses. The Government has a unique opportunity to invest that money in housing infrastructure, for sure, but also in climate infrastructure. Instead, there has been a lack of urgency and a delay. As I said, the auction for offshore wind last week, the first of its kind, was welcome. However, it is disappointing to see delays in the roll-out of floating terminal wind generation capacity. The future of offshore wind lies in being able to develop both floating and fixed platforms and yet we are seeing no urgency from Government. This is a time when we should be seeing massive investment by the Government in the development of public transport infrastructure, cycling and active infrastructure. During National Bike Week, there should have been a big announcement on such infrastructure. We are not seeing that investment. I appeal to the Tánaiste to take up the constructive proposals we are putting forward that would enable us to meet our climate targets and would tackle this worrying rise in emissions.	spk_216

It would empower the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, to undertake an analysis of price setting and could require retailers to provide information on pricing. This would be a meaningful step towards correcting the power imbalance that exists between consumers on the one hand and retailers on the other.

The survey sadly confirms the high prevalence of sexual violence in Ireland. It is shocking, but not surprising, to read that 28% of men and 52% of all women experience sexual violence over the course of their lifetimes. This publication comes in the wake some years ago of the Sexual Abuse and Violence in Ireland, SAVI, report, which perhaps first disclosed the true extent and prevalence of DSGBV. It also comes in the wake of the much more recent Women of Honour report, which exposed the horrific sexual harassment and intimidation experienced by members of our Defence Forces. We see in this survey, as we saw with the SAVI and Women of Honour reports, that there is a gendered dimension to this violence and that DSGBV is, unfortunately, all too prevalent in Irish society, as it is in other societies. Sadly, this is an international phenomenon. In Ireland, we have a particularly dark history as regards the treatment of women and the downplaying, and even dismissal, of sexual violence against women and children. That situation persisted for far too long. We are all thinking of the various carceral institutions in which women and children were confined for many decades, for example, the Magdalen institutions, the mother and baby homes and the industrial schools, in which much violence was perpetrated, but this survey highlights that the issue persists even after those institutions have happily been closed down and that there is still much more work to be done. I pay tribute to the Minister without Portfolio, Deputy McEntee, who has done a great deal on DSGBV. The third national strategy was an important step forward. I know how closely stakeholders, front-line advocates and services worked with the Department of Justice and other Departments to try to achieve a clear pathway to the necessary reforms to address DSGBV. The Joint Committee on Gender Equality, which I was proud to chair, examined the issue of gender-based violence. In particular, we examined the important recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality. I pay tribute to the citizens who decided to include DSGBV within the remit of their deliberations and report. Their recommendations, and our action plan based on those recommendations, have to be actioned. Since we engaged with the Minister, Deputy McEntee, on the report, I know there is a commitment to doing so. That is important. We were considering the citizens' assembly's report in the aftermath of the horrific killing of Ashling Murphy in January 2022, which again shone a most awful light on the pervasiveness of sexual violence and, indeed, gendered violence in Ireland. Despite the statistics that we are discussing, as disclosed by the CSO survey, the seriousness, frequency and pervasiveness of sexual and gender-based violence has been played down for far too long. It is almost never treated as the human rights abuse and human rights crisis that it is. It is the fault of our criminal justice system that incidents are often seen as isolated or that victims are even regarded as being complicit in some way. That has been a terrible undercurrent to many of our criminal justice procedures and rules for far too long. Some years ago, I had the opportunity to work with the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre on an EU-funded study of rape laws and trial procedures. We published that in 1998. At the time, we found there were hugely gendered assumptions and so-called rape myths that underlay much of the criminal law. For example, the rules around evidence specific to rape and sexual offence trials required corroboration of complainants' evidence and enabled defendants to bring in evidence of prior sexual experience, which is still the case. While we have done a great deal and there has been important legislation - I should also mention the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Ms Frances Fitzgerald, MEP, who did much to reform our laws on domestic violence and sexual offences in 2017 - there is still far too much gendered violence. The statistics in this survey leave us wondering what we can do further to ensure that the next generation - our daughters' generation - will not be subjected to the same levels of sexual violence and everyday harassment experienced by me, my peers and generations of women before us. It is especially important that we, as legislators, reflect on the specific gendered impact on women of sexual violence. The Ceann Comhairle has highlighted this as an issue among women public representatives. There has been a welcome disclosure about the levels of gendered abuse that women in public life endure. Misogyny is endemic in society; it cuts through all levels. As always, the least powerful are the most severely and adversely impacted, and women are in the least powerful positions, which is true across the world, not just in Ireland. We must address this issue and cannot just assume that it will not continue. The #MeToo movement has done a great deal to expose the reality of women's gendered experiences of harassment and violence. The common strand across the #MeToo movement and all the work being done by many important groups such as the NWCI and rape crisis centres is the imbalance of power between women and men in society - the patriarchal structures that enable violence, harassment and everyday intimidation to continue. That power imbalance must be redressed. We need to recognise the harm done by sexual violence and the way in which it not only contributes to the power imbalance, but is also caused by it.We therefore need to adopt an approach that cuts across Departments and across society to ensure that educational measures are adopted and that, as early as the preschool stages, girls and boys are taught to be respectful of one another in order that we can build a society where women and men are truly equal. The understanding that underpinned the gender equality report and the deliberations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality was that sexual, domestic and gender-based violence cannot be seen or addressed in isolation from other aspects of gendered experience and gender discrimination in society. I will wind up by acknowledging the positive changes that have been made and by underlining a few of the really important measures that need to be taken. I again pay tribute to those who have done so much to move forward our understanding of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. I refer to organisations like Women's Aid and the rape crisis centres. I particularly commend Noeline Blackwell, the outgoing head of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, for all her work. She is now stepping down but she has done a great deal through her own advocacy to highlight issues and the changes that need to be made. I particularly note that the positive changes to our criminal trial processes and to our support systems were largely brought about because of the brave women and men who have spoken out about their experiences as victims and as survivors. We have seen really powerful advocates speaking from their own personal experience. Despite these positive changes, there are still key issues that need to be addressed. I will now highlight some of them. Under-reporting and case attrition are very significant problems and have been for as long as I can remember while working in the criminal justice service. We see these issues again in this survey. Less than half of adults, 47%, who experienced sexual violence in their lifetime told someone about it. The rate is lower again for reporting to the Garda. We still need to do a great deal to encourage higher levels of reporting and to ensure there is no attrition after the reporting stage, that is, that cases are not redesignated. A classic instance of this we have come across a great many times is where a woman reports a rape but this is then downgraded to another sexual offence in the statistics. This shows attrition even between the reporting and recording stages. We know there are also great difficulties with regard to disclosures where violence is inflicted by an intimate partner, the so-called domestic violence context. That is a real problem. Again, through different legislation, particularly in 2017 and 2018, we have sought to ensure that intimate partner violence is recognised as particularly pernicious and that it is addressed. Some years ago, the Oireachtas justice committee did an in-depth study of the laws and procedures around domestic violence. One of the issues that really stood out to me from the testimony of the witnesses and survivors who spoke to us was the question of why they were the ones to need refuges. Clearly, we do need refuges. We need to see more investment in refuges. Progress has been far too slow. This is one area where there has been very valid of criticism of Government, which has been far too slow in rolling out refuge spaces. However, there is also the question of why it is the women and children who have to leave their homes when we see violence perpetrated. Why have we not turned our system around to ensure that perpetrators lose their homes where they are guilty of violence and human rights abuses within a family? Traditionally and for far too long, abuses within families have been seen as not worthy of the same level of response from a criminal justice perspective. That must change. I will finish by again saluting the bravery of those who participated in this study and those very many survivors who have told their stories and helped to change our society.	spk_199
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-05-16	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_3	Along with my Labour colleagues, I condemn outright the horrific attacks that took place in my constituency this weekend with the burning of tents on Sandwith Street and the intimidation of individuals forced to sleep in tents in and around the Mount Street area. I met with these people over the weekend. I met with people who travelled to Ireland to seek refuge and to make a contribution to our society and who instead have been given no choice but to sleep on the streets awaiting the processing of their applications to stay and the allocation of housing from our wealthy State. It is an appalling indictment that we cannot provide them, apparently, with accommodation. I again say that all of us have to show political leadership in condemning the small number of far-right activists who took this brutal action in burning people out of their homes and burning down tents. I went to see the destruction in the burnt-out alleyway off Sandwith Street and the awful scenes that we saw circulated on social media. I absolutely condemn that small number of individuals, who are in no way representative of Irish society, which has shown a great welcome to those who have come here to seek refuge. The attacks are a stain on our society and those responsible must be brought to justice. I have engaged with the local police and I know that investigations are under way. The circumstances in which people are forced to sleep on the streets while awaiting the processing of applications are also shameful. The Government needs to do more on this. I have repeatedly raised this issue with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and I thank him for his engagement with me on this matter over the weekend. Clearly, we need to see increased capacity and the delivery of accommodation at scale for those who come here to seek refuge. I have repeatedly asked for a dedicated Minister for refugee and international protection services. I have called on the Taoiseach to ensure greater co-ordination between Government Departments because there is still a sense that the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has been left to shoulder almost the entire responsibility for housing those who come here to seek refuge and that other Departments have simply not been willing to assist and support that Department and to provide the necessary accommodation, which we have a duty to provide. Indeed, the High Court recently confirmed that the Government is in breach of our international duties in failing to provide accommodation. This is even worse because we are a nation of emigrants. For generations, Irish people fled to safer shores and went abroad to find prosperity and peace. We would like to think they were not forced to sleep on the streets in the places they went. I ask the Minister to speak with the Taoiseach to ensure that we restore humanity to our refugee accommodation system.Furthermore, the arrival of refugees and inward migration to Ireland is a positive thing at a time when the Government consistently cites labour shortages as a causal factor in the chronic housing shortage and undersupply of housing. Many of these people are highly skilled and want to come here and work. They told me on Saturday they just want to work to contribute to our society. Work is always the best way to ensure integration. Will the Minister guarantee that the Government will take a more co-ordinated approach urgently to address the crisis in which people are sleeping on the streets who need to be housed and have the right to work?	spk_24

That is over a year in which the Government could and should have pulled together a more coherent, co-ordinated and joined-up response to this crisis. She spoke of a cross-governmental approach but there is no sense of leadership from the Taoiseach on this matter. Instead we heard him seeking to deflect blame, it appears, onto policing and the Garda when this issue is about cross-departmental supports for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in supplying housing. I have been pushing for the use of sites in my constituency, such as Jurys Hotel in Ballsbridge, Baggot St. Hospital and empty office buildings that could be scaled up to provide accommodation. The Minister spoke of the Department of Defence. What about the use of empty barracks or empty housing on Department of Defence sites? The Government said in January that there would be 700 modular homes in place for refugee accommodation by Easter, which we have not seen. Where is the sense of urgency and the massive level of State intervention, which was put to such good effect during Covid?Where is that sense of co-ordination and of support?

I offer my condolences and sympathies to all those who have lost family members and friends over those years. I thank my colleagues in Sinn Féin for putting forward this important Bill to which we in Labour our delighted to offer full support. I also acknowledge the ongoing work of our colleague in the other House, Senator Black, who has done so much to forward bring forward the occupied territories Bill. I was glad to support it when I was in the Seanad and it still has strong Labour support there. It has passed through the Seanad and received cross-party support. I hope, notwithstanding the Government speeches, we will see cross-party support for this Bill too. Other speakers have pointed out there has for many years been a strong sense across different parties in government and opposition of support for the cause of the Palestinian people and strong condemnation rightly offered for the breaches of international law and abuses of human rights by the State of Israel. There is a strong tradition of that in all parties in Ireland. We in Labour are happy to support this Bill. It is in keeping with our long track record on Palestinian rights. Our former leader, Eamon Gilmore, when Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade very strongly advocated for the rights of the Palestinian people. When he addressed the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September 2011, he made a speech that was groundbreaking at that time. He stated Ireland would support the Palestinian bid to become a full member of the UN and he repeated this position on numerous occasions as Minister. I have been a long-time supporter of the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign, the Sadaka campaign and the rights of the Palestinian people. I had the pleasure, along with many Labour colleagues and colleagues of all parties, of attending the Amnesty picnic in front of Leinster House last week where this important issue was raised. It was acknowledged Israel has been carrying out what is effectively and apartheid system against the Palestinian people. Even in the days since then we have seen dreadful violence, including killing of Palestinian children and ongoing oppression and abuse of Palestinians. It is, therefore, essential that we continue putting on pressure internationally and in Ireland to end the illegal occupation of Palestinian land and to address the gross human rights abuses being inflicted on the Palestinian people, who have lost so much over the past 75 years, which we recognise this week with the anniversary of the Nakba. I think we all recognise the State is committed to working for a resolution of the crisis in the Middle East and to ensuring there will be a two-state solution. However, we must look at actions we can take, rather than just at words and offering support at the international level. The Bill represents an action that can be taken in Ireland. It is an opportunity to ensure taxpayers' money is not directly or indirectly funding Israeli breaches of international law. To date, the National Treasury Management Agency has invested through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund in nine Israeli companies, including four banks, that operate in illegal Israeli settlements. These banks provide direct financing to Israeli construction, infrastructure and maintenance projects being undertaken on land expropriated from Palestinian people. The ISIF is funded by taxpayers' money, which means Irish taxpayers are de facto investors in the financing and sustenance of apartheid. There is a dreadful irony here. When I was on the foreign affairs committee between 2016 and 2020, it was well-recognised than not just Irish but EU taxpayers were financing development programmes in Gaza and the West Bank, only to see the results, including schools, homes and Palestinian infrastructure built with EU moneys and public moneys from here, being demolished by the Israeli state. This is part of a regime of demolitions and forcible movement of Palestinian people. We have seen this over a long period and this Bill is one small way in which we can achieve some sort of recognition of that appalling practice. It has been condemned at EU level too that EU money has been used, rightly, to pay for the building-up of Palestinian infrastructure that is then being demolished by the State of Israel, apparently with impunity at international level. In recognition of this, and so much more, the Dáil voted unanimously to recognise the de facto annexation of Palestinian land by Israel. International law recognises this as illegal. Given our own history of colonialism, we are in a unique position to understand the Palestinian struggle. It is ethically questionable to continue investment in the economy of settlement lands where this investment helps to expand the occupation. There is also a significant workers' rights crisis and as the party of work and of the trade union movement, I wish to highlight it. There is also a significant workers' rights issue at play here, especially with Israeli companies financed indirectly by some of our money. Palestinian workers do not enjoy the same rights and protections as Israelis in the illegal settlements. To work on the settlements, Palestinians must obtain a permit from Israeli authorities. They need permission to work on land that was in many cases illegally expropriated from them. These work permits can be annulled at any time, including when Palestinian workers seek to organise collectively to demand their rights and seek to unionise or engage in political activity. Permits are tied to their employers and this means workers in the occupied territories are especially vulnerable to what would be regarded in any country as labour rights violations. Palestinians face salary discrimination, poor working conditions, the withholding or denial of wages, the arbitrary cancellation of work permits by the Israeli authorities and they are unable to switch employers. Israeli labour regulations technically apply to employers in the settlements, but they are rarely enforced and Palestinian workers are, as we all know, reluctant to demand their rights for fear of losing their permits. That very important aspect underlies the motivation for this Bill. As a final point, there is considerable international precedence for divestment from Israeli enterprises on ethical grounds. Norway’s largest pension fund divested from 16 Israeli companies that operated on illegal settlements, while a major Dutch pension fund did similarly. We have rightly agreed to divest the ISIF from fossil fuel undertakings. That decision was a result of climate policy, but it is clearly an ethical matter. I am reflecting on the context of President Higgins's important speech about the economy in which he spoke so powerfully about the need to ensure economy, ecology and ethics are aligned and linked, namely, that we cannot detach our economy from our ethics and we clearly cannot detach ethics from our foreign policy. We are proud Irish foreign policy is bound up in ethical considerations and, therefore, as part of that policy, we should seek to ensure, in any way we can, that public money is not being used to contribute to violations of international law and to the oppression of a people, namely, the Palestinians. In supporting this Bill, we are taking more than a symbolic act in support of the Palestinian people. If this Bill were to be passed by the House and not delayed as the Government is proposing, it would send a clear message to the Israeli Government and Israeli businesses that we condemn the actions of the Israeli regime that inflict abuses on the Palestinian and which are in breach of international law. Supporting this Bill shows we stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine in their struggle for self-determination and their struggle simply to see the norms of international law respected and their rights being respected at that level too. I urge the Minister of State and all Government colleagues, many of whom have stood in support of Palestinian rights on multiple occasions, to support the Bill and not delay it. They should join with us on the Opposition benches, from which the Bill is going to receive strong support, to ensure we speak collectively as an Oireachtas not just in support of the Palestinian people but in support of international law.	spk_266
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-05-11	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_31	"Earlier this week I raised with the Taoiseach the desperate case of Micheline Walsh and her husband, who are in their late 70s and facing eviction. I said then they were not alone and, very sadly, today we see a report from Alone and Threshold on older and ageing persons in the private rental sector. The report notes 40% of older people who are now renting expect to have to continue renting in the private market for the rest of their lives. Many of them are reporting high stress as a result of the housing insecurity they are experiencing as renters. These are the hidden victims of the housing crisis. These are people - pensioners - who have worked all their lives and contributed to society in innumerable ways and are supposed to be able to enjoy retirement in peace and security. Instead, older people are faced with the constant stress of housing insecurity, which we all know has a detrimental effect on health. Many older people are forced to move prematurely into nursing homes and are denied their right to live independently by the chronic shortage of homes. Time and time again the struggles of older people and their situation are ignored by society and the State. Our entire housing and pension system has for far too long relied on the assumption people aged over 65 years will have paid off their mortgages, own their own homes and will not be renting. As Minister for Finance, the Minister will be aware the non-contributory State pension assumes this. It sits at a meagre €13,000 per year. Even with the housing assistance payment, HAP, how could anyone be expected to pay a mortgage or for private rented accommodation on that income? Our pension system is totally unfit for purpose when so many people aged over 65 years, and people who will soon be aged over 65 years, face having to rent into the future in a situation where rents have been allowed inflate so rapidly. The housing policy of the Minister's Government does not support those who are most vulnerable and most in need of its support. The figure for people expecting to rent into pension age will only rise. Our population is ageing rapidly, and with the chronic housing shortage, the many generations locked out of homeownership will need a more sophisticated pension system to cope with the rising cost of housing. This is the ticking time bomb of the housing crisis. As Minister for Finance, the Minister will be aware of this. I am increasingly hearing, as we all are, from people in their 40s and 50s who are still renting long after they thought they would be able to afford to buy their own home. We all know that thousands of people in their 20s and 30s, the youngest generation now adults, have already accepted they have no prospect of owning their own home. They do not see any prospect of being able to do so. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage stated the research published today would ""help inform our policies and target our housing actions further"", as if this problem had appeared out of thin air and was not a result of two successive Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Governments. It is a disgrace the problem has been allowed get so bad and that we have waited until we have 12,000 people homeless, including 175 people aged over 65 years in emergency accommodation, before we see specific action for the elderly. Will the Minister commit to reimagining our pension system to ensure no one needs to live in poverty during their retirement and to reinstate the eviction ban so older people in particular who are renting will at least not experience the insecurity they are facing in so many ways?"	spk_204

I commend the authors of the report from Threshold and Alone, because they have shone a spotlight on what is, as the Minister has acknowledged, a problem we are going to see increasing with an ageing population and the ticking time bomb resulting from the chronic housing shortage. However, the Minister's Government needs to do something about this. Once again we are hearing a lack of urgency from the Minister when it comes to actions. On pensions, we have called for them to be indexed to the rate of inflation. On insecurity of housing for persons renting into older age, what the Government can do is stabilise the rental sector and make it a viable option for people to live in long-term. Across Europe, older people live in the rental sector long-term in peace, in full security and without the prospect of eviction. That is the difference here. Not only are people unable to afford to pay rents given the level of pension we have currently, but there is also the insecurity of facing a situation where evictions are permitted again. That is before we get into the huge difficulties experienced by so many in trying to find alternative accommodation when they have been evicted. It is very difficult and especially for older persons, those who might not have access to the Internet and those forced to queue down the block for accommodation. There is such a shortage.	spk_206

The most recent figures show nearly 3,500 of those 12,000 are children living in homelessness - 3,472 children, a 23% increase on the same time last year. It is likely that these horrific figures will continue to rise as the Government fails to take specific action to target homelessness among older people, children and vulnerable populations. The Government claims to care about homelessness, but where is the evidence? It chose to lift the eviction ban earlier this year at a time when NGOs and charities working in sector stated categorically that it would make the problem worse. The Government chose to favour the pockets of private landlords over the interests of pensioners, children and families facing homelessness. I ask the Taoiseach to stop for a second and to look at what the Government has done. He needs to stop and think about the 12,000 people, including pensioners and children, who have no homes. He needs to stop and think about the trauma being inflicted on children and young people who have no safe home to go to. He needs to stop and think about the thousands of parents fighting night and day to secure a roof over their children's heads. Where was the support for homeless families and homeless pensioners in the Government's mini-budget? The Government can begin the journey to ending child homelessness. I am bringing to its attention a constructive proposal that was put forward by Focus Ireland this morning. In 2017, former Labour Deputy Jan O Sullivan introduced the Housing (Homeless Families) Bill, which was widely accepted on a cross-party basis, including by the current Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, who expressed strong words of support for the Bill. The aim of the Bill was to address the specific needs of children in homelessness by ensuring local authorities would act in the best interests of the child when determining housing need.The Bill was a response to a situation where parents and children were being referred to Garda stations with nowhere else to go. It is deeply saddening how little has changed in the six years since former Deputy Jan O'Sullivan put forward the Bill. Today, along with Focus Ireland, I urge the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, to step up and make the change to ensure that the best interests of the child are paramount in making housing decisions. Homelessness is something that no person, older or younger, should have to go through. The impact of homelessness on children, however, is uniquely difficult because the early years of a child's life are central to his or her development, physically and emotionally. It is when they take their first steps and when they learn to feel safe and secure. It is a tragedy for them to learn that the Government has turned its back on them. Will the Taoiseach commit to passing our Housing (Homeless Families) Bill so that no child has to endure the horror of homelessness? Will the Taoiseach admit that the Government's housing policy has failed to take sufficient account of the needs of vulnerable pensioners, of older people, and of children and families?	spk_5

Time after time we hear the Taoiseach say that family homelessness and child homelessness is a stain on our society as if he was an observer. The Taoiseach is in government and has been in government for several terms. The Taoiseach needs to ensure that action is taken. If it takes a Bill to ensure that local authorities will make the best interests of the child paramount, then that Bill and legislation should be adopted. I have the scrutiny report here.The joint committee proposed that the Bill should proceed to the next Stage and that it should be amended in consultation with the drafters. We are very willing to work with the Government to ensure this constructive means of addressing child homelessness is taken up. We certainly express huge solidarity with Micheline Walsh, her family and all those experiencing homelessness. The reality is, however, that the Government has done too little and is doing it too late to really address the needs of families, older people and children in homelessness. Extending the temporary no-fault eviction ban for a further period would and could have given the Government the breathing space to put in place proper effective measures to address the needs of Micheline and others like her. Instead, nothing concrete was put in place when the ban was lifted and so many people, unfortunately, like Micheline and her family, are in this void or abyss where they simply have nowhere to go.	spk_7

Yet many corporations are not supporting the struggles of their staff. Several Tesco workers who work on the front line in packing and delivering food to people in communities across the country have come to me to share stories of how their wages are being cut due to roster changes. One employee told me they will lose almost €3,500 per annum. That person does not know if they will be able to pay their mortgage because of this roster change. Meanwhile, these companies are reporting record profit margins. Roster changes are a common means of subtly reducing labour costs and workers' pay by companies behind the guise of efficiency.On every side, with wages, food prices and the cost of housing taken together, we are seeing working people being squeezed for the sake of profit. In this month of May, as we celebrate workers' rights, it is time this Government stood up to big business and backed workers and their rights. Will the Taoiseach act to ensure greater security for workers in the face of mounting costs for basic necessities?

My party colleague Deputy Kelly has proposed a constructive way around this. I know the Taoiseach responded to a question about this earlier.

The impact of these redundancies has obviously been huge for those directly and indirectly impacted, not only in my own constituency of Dublin Bay South but across the country. The impact is more worrying where there are concerns regarding a lack of compliance by companies with redundancy rules, such as the 30-day statutory consultation period. I encourage all tech workers to join a trade union to ensure rights are protected. While I welcome the announcement today of Cabinet plans to strengthen rights around collective redundancies, I ask that the Government would go further. I believe we need to see comprehensive strengthening of collective bargaining rights and the Government should ensure a right to organise to ensure that workers can insulate themselves from the worst impacts of layoffs. Does the Tánaiste acknowledge that this series of redundancies proves the need to introduce a right to organise in unions and commit to establishing a task force to support tech workers now facing layoffs?	spk_188
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-05-03	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	On Friday we learned that homelessness figures have risen yet again to almost 12,000 people, which represents a 2.1% increase month on month. These figures relate to the period just before the lifting of the eviction ban took effect. I shudder to think what the figure for next month will be, as the evictions allowed to proceed by the Government come into force. These figures show that the Government is divorced from reality, detached from reality. In light of consistently rising homelessness figures - rising yet again last month - the Government made the indefensible decision to lift the temporary no-fault eviction ban. By doing so, it chose to pull the rug out from under families and individuals who are facing homelessness. It fails to understand that each of these numbers also represents a life - the life of a child living in uncertainty, a parent trying to keep a brave face or an elderly person living in fear. These new figures do not even begin to capture those in hidden homelessness, those who are couch surfing, adult young people living on in childhood bedrooms and the thousands who are emigrating for lack of affordable housing. Having one family in homelessness is one family too many. It is even more so the case when we know how inappropriate emergency housing and hotel stays are beyond a couple of nights. Week in and week out, children are getting ready for school in hotel bedrooms and students are preparing for junior cert and leaving cert State exams, not knowing what home they will be going back to. They are being failed by the Government, and that is a national tragedy. The Government could have used the period of the eviction ban as the breathing space to allow for the introduction of emergency housing measures, which would have provided support to families then facing eviction. However, the Government instead saw it only as an opportunity to kick the can down the road. Days before the ban was due to be lifted - and even in the days immediately following its lifting - there were no concrete plans in place to support the thousands facing eviction and about to become homeless as the ban was lifted. The Government’s mini budget, announced last week, was a desperate attempt to mitigate a crisis for which it has no one to blame but itself. These 11,988 people in homelessness deserve far more than what the coalition of convenience has offered.They have been left behind, out in the cold, while the Government's mini budget simply puts more money in the pockets of private developers. We in the Labour Party have consistently advocated for State-led, local authority-led, approved housing body-led solutions to the housing crisis but we have yet to see our constructive proposals taken on board. Instead, the Government has retained a failed private developer-led model and it has failed to live up to the hype it has created around housing. Its shocking failure to control the controllables is a disgrace. Will the Taoiseach reinstate the eviction ban? Will it adopt the Labour Party's constructive proposals to begin the pathway for families and individuals to safe, secure and affordable housing? Will the Government take on board the measures we are proposing to do that?	spk_13

Of course homelessness is a stain on our society. It is shameful that we have nearly 12,000 people in homelessness at a time when the country is running very significant budget surpluses, with a surplus of over €5 billion last year. I disagree with him, however, on the eviction ban. We have heard from all of those working with people who are homeless that the homelessness figures would have been much worse had it not been for the existence of the temporary ban. It should not have been lifted when it was, in the absence of measures to support families and households facing homelessness. We in the Labour Party have supported Government measures when they have been effective to prevent homelessness and to increase housing stock - of course we have - but the reality is that the Taoiseach's Government has done too little and has failed the families who are now in homelessness. It is also failing the workers. The month of May is a time to celebrate workers and workers' rights. The housing crisis is a workers’ rights issue, as we are hearing from the nurses' union today. We have recruitment and retention challenges across healthcare, construction, hospitality and all other sectors. The housing crisis is a major contributor to that. Will the Government accept the Labour Party's constructive proposals? I refer, for example, to the National Minimum Wage (Inclusion of Apprentices) Bill 2023, which will be debated tonight in the Seanad. This Bill, which has been introduced by our Seanad Whip, Senator Marie Sherlock, would provide apprentices with higher levels of pay and attract more people to work in construction, thereby helping us to deliver more housing, which is a measure the Taoiseach and his Government want to do.Here is a constructive proposal from us, a simple measure that could be adopted and accepted by the Government to help alleviate the housing crisis.	spk_15

To still have more than 700 patients waiting for beds in May, well past the peak of respiratory illnesses, is indicative of a year-round trolley crisis. Our overcrowded healthcare service has become unsuitable for both patients and workers. We hear harrowing stories from the INMO and from individuals on the front line, who feel they cannot provide adequate care in the circumstances. All workers deserve to work in a safe environment where they are supported to deliver the highest standard of care. It is no wonder we are seeing retention and recruitment crises across the healthcare service, given the sort of issues and conditions that are under way.

This includes organisations like Irish Families Through Surrogacy, Equality for Children, LGBT Ireland and Irish Gay Dads. I also want to thank all the individuals from civil society, academia and legal practice who have worked on this.

I want to particularly commend the Chair of the surrogacy committee, Deputy Whitmore, and her Vice-Chair, Deputy Higgins, and the committee for producing such a clear, thoughtful and sensitively written report in such a tight timeframe. I was appointed Chair of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality, and we thought we had a tight timeframe of nine months to consider the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality until we heard that Deputy Whitmore's committee was being given three months. I want to commend the surrogacy committee on producing this report in such a timely fashion and on the urgency it brought to bear on this.

I know the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, have been engaging with groups and individuals on these issues.

There is a cross-party consensus on this. I will speak briefly about the work of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality. Our committee recommended in December that a referendum should be held to ensure that the Constitution is amended, not just to delete sexist language about women and mothers, but also to insert a gender-neutral recognition of the value of care and, crucially, to recognise more diverse forms of family beyond the family based on marriage. I am glad the Government has committed to holding that referendum in November and that is clearly of huge relevance when we debate child and family relationships legislation because we need to ensure that our Constitution recognises diverse family forms too, which is important. As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, I was actively involved in a previous debate on the regulation of surrogacy in the lead-up to the passage of the Child and Family Relationships Act 2015, which was originally intended to include regulation on AHR and surrogacy. We did not get to do that because there was an urgency about passing the legislation prior to the marriage equality referendum taking place, but I am conscious of how complex this area is to regulate because it was something we could not do then. None of us on that committee foresaw that it would take nearly ten years before we would come to finally see legislation brought forward and there has been such terrible uncertainty for so many families, some of whom are in the Gallery, during that period. There is a real urgency, particularly in respect of the retrospective declarations that need to be made. That is recognised and I welcome the fact that the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, as I understand it, has confirmed that the retrospective declarations process can proceed before the framework for prospective declarations is fully in place. That is certainly-----	spk_411
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-04-27	dail	33	Final Report of the Joint Committee on International Surrogacy: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_43	"Indications have been given and that is welcome. Parents and families I have spoken to are anxious to see that proceed and to see the issue of judicial discretion built into that such that judges will have some discretion, which is important. The report recognises that the case of retrospective parentage declarations is separate and needs a separate and different approach to be taken. I refer to the prospective regulatory framework that is to be established through this. I entirely appreciate the need to bring these provisions forward through the existing AHR Bill. It is heartening to hear the Minister indicating that he is hoping to do this before the summer recess. It is welcome to hear that but it is important that we get this right. As I said, parents have raised a number of concerns with me, particularly around which other countries will be included in the arrangements and which countries it will be possible to have arrangements with. There is clearly a need for a broad international framework and I am thinking, as we do with the adoption procedures and the Geneva Convention, that countries should abide by the Verona principles. I know the matter of which other countries will be included is of concern, as is the matter of reasonable expenses. I know the committee grappled with this and I read with great interest what it said about the payment issue. Clearly this is a difficult issue and we grappled with this ten years ago as well. What does ""reasonable expenses"" envisage? Does it envisage expenses beyond just altruistic expenses? What happens when an agency is involved? There will be a lot of concerns about what detail will be there. This is a complex area and so it is important that the balancing exercise is done right. We are all conscious - and again it is well set out in the report - of the risk of exploitation. I mention the language and I am glad to see that the report interrogates this and ""surrogate"" is the term used because that is the term that was preferred by witnesses. We are conscious that we do not tend to hear from surrogate mothers as much; that has been the nature of it and the language around that can be difficult. The key thing is to ensure there is regard not only for the rights of children born through surrogacy, but also for the rights of intending parents and families of children born through surrogacy and for the rights of surrogates and surrogate mothers. It is crucial, therefore, to ensure there are safeguards against the risk of exploitation, particularly relating to countries that are less developed or developing countries. That is built into the considerations in the report. I am glad to see that because it is important. There are strong recommendations around the protection of the bodily autonomy of the surrogate, which is to be welcomed by us all.  There is going to be a great deal more time to debate the detail of this. I very much welcome the careful timeline the Minister has provided. I want to ask about the question of paid surrogacy leave, which has been raised. It is referred to in the report. We have put down parliamentary questions about it. We have had quite a number of people come to us wondering when it will be in place. That will have to be part of any regulatory framework. I will finish by commending all of those involved in producing this delicate and really careful report on what is a difficult and sensitive area to regulate. I welcome it because, ultimately, this is a very joyful endeavour. It is an endeavour to ensure that we are going to see proper legal frameworks for the welcoming of children and diverse family forms in our society. That is very welcome."	spk_413
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-04-25	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	This country is facing a housing disaster of epic proportions, with a shortage of homes that is exacerbating generational divides and inequality, affecting health outcomes and the education system and stifling job growth. Today, the Government is casting more money into yet another package of additional measures on housing which the Taoiseach says will deliver results but which represents the latest in a series of desperate efforts to kick some life into the Government's housing policy. It is yet another attempt to tweak the Housing for All policy which the Taoiseach must accept is failing. Indeed, it is a tacit acceptance that Housing for All is failing and has not delivered results, that the Government is out of its depth and lacks ambition, urgency and, crucially, any impact on the housing disaster. We have not seen the delivery and results that people require. Instead, the Government continues to throw good money after bad while nothing changes for those who are desperately seeking a home, confined to childhood bedrooms because they cannot afford to move out of their parents' homes or stuck paying exorbitant rents in tiny cramped bedsits. Since the indefensible lifting of the eviction ban, many more people are now facing the abyss of homelessness because they have been served an eviction notice and there are no contingency plans in place from the Government. Among the tweaked measures announced today is a temporary waiver of development contributions. In effect, it is yet another unconditional subsidy for developers. I listened carefully to the Taoiseach's response to Deputy McDonald. He referred to people building their own homes but it is not limited to people building their own homes; presumably it will apply to all developers. The Taoiseach described it as socialising community cost, which is an extraordinary way to characterise what is an unconditional grant and subsidy to developers. Over-reliance on the private sector has simply failed, so why is the Government continuing to throw good money after bad in this way? Why is it not committing massive State investment in local authorities and approved housing bodies? Why is it not committing State investment in the delivery of social and affordable homes? Does it believe developers will pass on the benefit of this new subsidy to first-time buyers? Will the Government be requiring them to do so? Will a condition be placed on this subsidy? That is the sort of measure that should be introduced by the Government in this housing disaster. Today's package also included grants intended to tackle vacancy and dereliction but, again, this is tweaking. I presume the vacant housing plan launched in January has also failed and that is why these measures are being tweaked again. What we are seeing is a series of piecemeal additions to the failed housing policy from this Government. Does the Taoiseach accept that the new package of measures amounts to no more than tweaking the edges of a plan that has no proven success and has certainly not delivered for the more than 11,700 people who are now in homelessness?	spk_8

Was political pressure applied to the Residential Tenancies Board to delay publication of those data? Why is the Government so averse to evidence-based decision-making?

This is a really disturbing revelation about GSOC. The Garda has mounted an investigation, and that is welcome. However, I echo the calls of my colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, for the establishment of an investigation of the matter independent both of GSOC and the Garda. This investigation could be led by a senior counsel or a retired judge or it could be modelled on the Seán Guerin inquiry. It should be swift and focused.

The Ministers and Secretaries (Attorney General) Bill 2023 is a Bill we prepared some months ago following the highlighting of the practice of illegal charging for older people in nursing home care and the removal of disability allowance payments from vulnerable persons in institutional care. At the time, we in the Labour Party called for a change in the law to ensure that the State's litigation strategy must have regard to the public interest. We called for a change in particular to be made to the Office of the Attorney General. This is the Bill we prepared in order to reform the Office of the Attorney General. It seeks to ensure that any legal advice provided to Government would have due regard to the vindication of people's rights and to the common good. It recognises that the Attorney General is not in the same position as a commercial law firm, and provides that defence strategies for litigation against the State have to be prepared with a proper consideration of the public interest. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill makes clear that this is permitted to be done under the Constitution. Article 30 of the Constitution establishes the Office of the Attorney General and provides that the Attorney General ""shall exercise and perform all such powers, functions and duties as are conferred or imposed on him by this Constitution or by law."" Clearly it is therefore a matter for the Oireachtas to legislate as to the role of the Attorney General, which is what we have sought to do here. In particular, section 3 of the Bill provides that the Attorney General has responsibility for ensuring that his or her functions in connection with the conduct of claims in litigation are performed in the public interest. We provide a definition of that and say that the Attorney General must have regard to this as well as to the interests of the person or body receiving the legal services.

Labour is glad to support this motion from the Social Democrats and I commend Deputy Cian O'Callaghan and his colleagues for putting it forward. As I said last night in the debate on the Sinn Féin motion, this motion is the latest in a series of constructive policy proposals being put forward by Opposition parties, providing suggestions, proposals, worked solutions and ways of resolving the housing disaster.It is disappointing, albeit not surprising, to see the Government again not engaging with Opposition parties on these constructive proposals and opposing them and putting forward countermotions, as it did last night and as it is doing today. The housing catastrophe is of such a scale that it requires a cross-party response. It requires a collaborative and constructive coming together of parties to look at how we can address this catastrophe with the necessary ambition and urgency. We in the Labour Party have put forward proposals too. On 9 February we put forward a series of eight emergency measures that we called on the Government to adopt prior to the lifting of the temporary no-fault eviction ban. The Government, again, did not engage and countered and opposed that motion. We have put forward a number of Private Members' Bills suggesting constructive ways to address the housing catastrophe, such as a homeless families Bill, a Bill to implement the Kenny report and a Bill on renters' rights. Most recently, we put to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage a Bill that would provide an evidence basis for the continuance of a ban on no-fault evictions until there is a demonstrable drop in homelessness figures. The Government has not engaged with these proposals. Instead, countless Government Ministers and spokespeople have set out reasons they cannot implement Opposition measures. That is what they have done, instead of telling us how they propose to implement constructive measures to address a housing crisis that the Minister, Deputy McGrath, and other Ministers acknowledge is the biggest crisis facing this country. At our recent Labour Party conference I set out an ambitious programme to deliver 1 million homes over ten years, based on the Government's own projections of 50,000 new builds and 50,000 refurbishments and deep retrofits per year. These are the Government's own figures and projections of housing need. The Taoiseach has told us there is a current shortfall of 250,000 homes. The Housing Commission has told us that we need up to 62,000 new builds per year to meet demographic demand and existing need. Yet, the Government will not engage. We are simply not seeing the level of ambition and urgency that is required. Instead we see a fatalism, a lack of ambition and a lack of creativity in the Government response and the Government programme that is being put forward at a time when we have record budget surpluses. Like other colleagues, I heard the Minister speaking this morning about the record budget surplus and the stability programme update which tells us there will be a €10 billion surplus in this year's budget. We had a surplus of over €5 billion last year. Yet there is a failure of spending, with an underspend of €1 billion on social and affordable home delivery by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. That is an extraordinary underspend in the teeth of a housing crisis. We know this is about ideology. It is not the economy or a lack of resources that are holding back the necessary State investment in housing. It is a reluctance, it seems, by the Government to interfere in the market. We see that in the unexpected and premature decision to lift the ban on evictions without having any contingency plans in place. Again, we have seen the Government's fatalism here - a stepping back and an acceptance that this is going to cause immense hardship for the 9,000 individuals served with eviction notices in the second half of last year. Threshold has told us today that many of those notices were in fact invalid yet we see again this fatalism and a failure by the Government to adopt the necessary measures that would have provided a safety net for renters facing the loss of their homes at a critical time. We are entering the period when children sit State exams and we are hearing from so many families who are absolutely desperate with nowhere to go. We see the same fatalism with regard to vacant homes. The Labour Party welcomes the vacant homes tax. We welcome any measure introduced by the Government to address the housing crisis and increase housing supply but it is not enough. We know even from the Minister's own proposals that a vacancy tax is simply not enough in itself. It needs to be set at a higher level to ensure not just that revenue is raised but also, crucially, to bring about a change in behaviour and culture. In his speech, the Minister put forward the lowest estimate of vacant properties in the State. The CSO has estimated a much higher figure of 166,000, which is a vacancy rate of nearly 8% - a high vacancy rate compared to other European countries. That excludes holiday homes. While the CSO figures are noted in the Government's own vacant homes plan alongside the other two sets of figures, I note the Minister has given us only the Revenue figure of 57,000, which is the lowest projection and is based on self-reporting. As others have said, GeoDirectory puts the figure at nearly 85,000. It is extraordinary that we simply do not have reliable data on this. Let us take the CSO rates or even the GeoDirectory rates. Hardware Association Ireland has used other criteria and suggests that up to 40,000 homes are clearly long-term vacant and immediately available for refurbishment. That is the sort of immediacy and urgency we need to refurbish vacant homes. All of us know from our own constituencies that there is a high level of vacancy and dereliction. I see it in Dublin Bay South. We see it everywhere. Hardware Association Ireland tells us, and I think it is right, that there is ""a deeper cultural issue [here] with an acceptance of a high level of spoilation in our built environment"". That has to be tackled but the Government's proposals are simply not sufficient, adequate or effective enough to tackle that culture. Its vacant homes action plan has acknowledged that and sets out a series of measures to be taken but we need greater urgency on these. We need greater urgency in tackling this high level of vacancy and we need an ambition from the Government. It can be done. The housing crisis can be addressed. It is simply not good enough for the Government to say it cannot address, for example, labour shortages or construction inflation. There are ways and means to do this. In December, the ESRI set out a range of measures that could be activated now by the Government to address labour shortages, such as an expansion of the list of skills on the critical skills visa programme, for example, to enable an aggressive recruitment campaign of workers from abroad. Social Justice Ireland backed that call this morning. We need that to be done. The Government's own estimates say we need another 20,000 construction workers. Let the Government act on this instead of sitting back and just observing a shortfall of 250,000 homes, observing that there may be up to 166,000 vacant properties in the State or observing that we need 20,000 more construction workers. Let action be taken urgently, with ambition and creativity, in the same way the State, the Revenue Commissioners and other State agents intervened during the Covid pandemic to use the levers of State power to address such a huge and existential crisis. Let us see those levers being used now by the State and by the Government so measures, like the measures being proposed in this motion, can be adopted by the Government with urgency."	spk_41

Níl tithe á dtógáil agus tá an ghéarchéim tithíochta ag dul in olcas. In the face of a worsening housing crisis, yesterday saw more evidence of the Government's failed policies on housing. Let us remind ourselves that last year, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, committed to delivering 9,000 new-build social homes and 4,000 affordable homes. However, yesterday it emerged that the Government has delivered just a fraction of those targets in 2022. It has missed targets on both social and affordable new builds. Frankly, this news comes as no surprise, given that we have learned that €1.5 billion of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage's capital budget was underspent between 2020 and 2022. More than €1 billion of that figure was intended for the delivery of social and affordable homes. The Oireachtas has returned today after a two-week break. I urge the Taoiseach to put the urgent resolution of the housing crisis at the centre of his focus now. Upon taking office, he set high expectations that substantial progress on housing would be made swiftly but since then, we have seen the same old stale policies repackaged and spun again and again. Indeed, the first sentence of yesterday's Government press release goes as far as to welcome what is, in fact, a failure of delivery and a failure to meet targets. The Government welcomed that failure to meet its own targets, which themselves have been accepted as being much too low, according to the Housing Commission. While we are all familiar with the phrase ""running to stand still"", homelessness figures are at a record high of 11,742 people while the Government is missing targets that fall short of what is needed. It is neither running nor going anywhere fast. We know the housing crisis is getting worse, not better, and that the unforgivable decision to lift the eviction ban, based on no data and with no contingency plan in place, is going to make things worse for so many. We know from the Residential Tenancies Board that more than 9,000 notices to quit were issued in the second half of last year. The Taoiseach said that leaving the ban in place would have made things worse but he has presented us with no evidence for that. We tabled parliamentary questions and FOI requests; we cannot get any data from the Government. Meanwhile, I am hearing from families in my own constituency who now have no choice but to overhold given that they have received a notice to quit and have nowhere else to go. I am hearing from pensioners who are facing eviction after years of renting the same home. Again, they have nowhere else to go. We are hearing from teachers' unions such as the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, which are faced with an exodus of teachers from the education system because the teachers cannot afford anywhere to live near their schools. This same exodus is depriving our society and our communities of much-needed highly skilled workers in healthcare, education and construction itself. Young people are being pushed out of cities after receiving eviction notices while unscrupulous landlords are putting their homes up for short-term rental on Airbnb and other platforms. Does the Taoiseach accept that the Government is out of its depth on housing, that it is simply not meeting the needs of our families and our communities and that the eviction ban decision has made matter worse?"	spk_10

We know that food shopping costs are expected to increase by an additional €1,200 for people this year alone. While no one denies the inflationary effect of the pandemic and of the war in Ukraine, the reality is that we are seeing very serious profiteering from large corporations which is amplifying price inflation. This has been referred to as greed-flation and, indeed, a European Central Bank, ECB, paper in March highlighted that corporate profits account for two thirds of domestic price pressures. We know that large companies with market power can raise prices well above the official inflation rates and households are paying the price. Will the Taoiseach face up to the profiteering and price-gouging which we are seeing, particularly in respect of food prices? Will he heed the calls made by my colleague, Deputy Nash, who has called on the Government to use the Consumer Protection Act 2007 to introduce price controls and to ensure we see food prices kept at affordable rates for households?	spk_75

On 9 February we in the Labour Party tabled a motion with a series of constructive measures. We have supplied Government with proposed Private Members' legislation. As with this proposal, all of our proposals have disappointingly been met with a very dismissive response from Government. It is disappointing because the scale of the crisis is such that we need concerted cross-party action on this. We need to see ambition and urgency from Government in addressing this catastrophic situation. We have a record 11,742 people in homelessness.Deputy Ó Broin rightly started his speech with reference to a different figure, which is that figure of €1 billion. This is an extraordinary sum which has been underspent by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage at this time of national catastrophe. This is money which was earmarked for the delivery of social and affordable housing. There is another figure which is worth mentioning, as we saw today in the stability programme update for 2023. We know that the country ran a budget surplus of over €5 billion in the past year and we see in today’s figures a projected surplus of €10 billion this year. It is ideology, rather than the economy, which is holding back the necessary massive investment by the State in housing infrastructure. There is an over-reliance by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael on the private sector to deliver. There is a reluctance to provide the necessary levels of State intervention that are required and to pivot the State resources, as was done during the Covid-19 pandemic. There is also a reluctance to commit the State to investing in necessary infrastructure and to interfering in the housing market, even though interference will be required.  I use that language because that is what underlies the Government’s unforgivable decision to lift the temporary ban on no-fault evictions without any evidence base and without having any contingency plan in place. The Minister said earlier tonight, and indeed Government Members have said consistently, that they believe that by extending the ban they would have made matters worse, but they have no evidence for that. The Government knew that by lifting the ban it would be driving more people into homelessness. We have stark figures from the Residential Tenancies Board on that. Over 9,000 notices to quit were issued in the second half of 2022, causing very serious hardship and distress to many families in my own constituency and in all of our constituencies. For example, I was approached by a family of three who are above the social housing limits, where both parents are in work. They have a young adult child in third level education and have nowhere to go. They have been forced into overholding because they are losing their home of ten years with an eviction notice. That is the reality of what is happening to so many families and to so many people. In this context, it is particularly galling to see missed targets. I refer to the figures from the Government on missed targets in housing. Just yesterday, we saw the Government’s own figures. It has openly said that it has missed the targets. In Housing for All, the Government’s plan was to deliver 9,000 new-build social homes but we have seen only 7,433 delivered in the past year. Again, the plan was to deliver 4,100 affordable and cost-rental houses and we have seen just 1,757 delivered. These are very serious shortfalls on targets that are, in themselves, too low. The Government’s own Housing Commission has pointed this out. This is all at a time of significant increasing demographic demand. We know that our population has grown by more than 500,000 in the past ten years. The Housing Commission is now telling us that up to 62,000 new homes per year will be needed up until 2050, which is nearly double the Housing for All target in the Government’s own document. The Taoiseach has pointed out that there is currently a shortfall of 250,000 homes. These are targets which will require serious urgency and ambition from the Government to meet but they are necessary targets because what we are hearing, and not just from families who are forced into homelessness but also from employers’ groups, IBEC and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, is that the investment in housing by the State which we are calling for is necessary because without it, we will see a serious impact on our economy, jobs and service delivery. We are hearing from healthcare workers and teachers that they cannot afford to live near their places of employment and that is causing real problems for the delivery of education and healthcare. It is in this context that we in the Labour Party, along with others in the Opposition, put forward constructive proposals for addressing the housing crisis. When we do so, we are met with a sort of smugness and a certain fatalism from the Government, almost as if it dismisses the prospect that anything can be done. Some weeks ago, at our Labour Party conference, I put forward an ambitious programme for the delivery of 1 million homes in ten years based on the Government’s own projections and figures, and the Housing Commission’s projections of need. Instead of engaging with us and pointing out how this can be achieved, the Government’s Ministers and Members have spent their time saying why this cannot be done and not how it can be done. The role of the Government is to deliver the homes people need. The key issue is delivery, which is something we all agree on. We supported the establishment of the LDA five years ago because we believe in constructive opposition. We believe in supporting measures which we believe will have an impact. We have been very disappointed at the slow pace of delivery by the LDA in the last five years, and I think the Minister shares this disappointment. That has to be acknowledged. We will support measures that will deliver. We do not support measures like the help to buy scheme which are counterproductive. Department of Finance officials have routinely been pointing out the deadweight effect of such schemes in subsidising economic activity which is already taking place, and in lining the pockets of developers. These are not schemes which are working but we will support ones which work and measures which aim to deliver housing. We will certainly continue to put forward constructive proposals. Let us look at how we can deliver 50,000 new-build homes per year over the next ten years. Again, we have engaged with the experts, have looked at the Government’s own projections and at its figures, and have looked at the ESRI’s recent report on how one can deliver homes at scale with necessary urgency and ambition. For example, this can be done through placing more construction trades on the critical skills employment permit list so that we can see an aggressive recruitment campaign for construction workers from abroad. We are consistently hearing a fatalism from the Government that we do not have the workers. Let us address that and take up the proposals the ESRI has made on how we can address this. Then we hear about difficulties with construction methods. Let us engage with new methods and technologies which enable off-site construction much more rapidly. Again the ESRI and IBEC tell us that we can use off-site construction to deliver homes 50% more quickly than traditional methods. We can mass-produce such homes to see delivery of high-volume and high-quality housing in a much shorter space of time. Let us see also some more creative engagement on the issue of live planning permissions. This is a real and very significant issue in my own constituency and across Dublin City Council where we know there are up to 30,000 live planning permissions for residential developments. Let us see the Government moving swiftly with a ""use it or lose it"" policy to stop developers from sitting on these planning permissions for the five years which they can currently do, without having to move on them. We need to incentivise, encourage and sanction where we are not seeing speedy delivery on live planning permissions. The main point we make in putting forward an ambitious programme for housing, not just for the delivery of new builds but also for the delivery of deep retrofit and refurbishment, is that we all should know we need that level of ambition and urgency. We in the Labour Party are the only party in the Opposition which has ever served in government. We have a track record of service in government and are proud of it. We are making realistic and sensible proposals for change in housing policy and for a more radical and urgent approach to housing which we are calling on the Government to engage with. We saw a previous Labour Party housing Minister, Jim Tully, delivering 100,000 public homes during a recession. The Minister’s Government constantly refers back to the 1970s. That was a Labour Party housing Minister who delivered that level of housing. We saw more recently in a boom period more than 60,000 new-build homes being delivered. We know it can be done and it is not a ludicrous thing to suggest that we need to build 50,000 new homes a year. This is based on the Government’s own figures, on our knowledge of the demographic demand, and on realistic proposals as to how we can do this. We can only do this, however, if the State steps up and if we see it engaging and enabling the level of investment that is required to ensure we can recruit the level of construction workers we need, mobilise resources in new technologies with off-site construction and modular housing, and ensure we will have creative proposals from the Opposition which it will engage seriously with. That is what we should be seeing from the Government and it is unfortunate that we are not seeing that level of engagement. I call on the Minister to withdraw the countermotion which I believe is just reiterating the litany of measures which the Government says it has taken. All we have seen are failed targets and failure to deliver."	spk_349

He spent more time lambasting the Labour Party than he did setting out what the Government has achieved on housing, yet he is accusing us in opposition of politicising housing. That sums up the problem with the Government. Housing is political. In choosing to lift the eviction ban in three days' time, the Taoiseach has engaged in making a political choice, and it is the wrong choice. It is a political choice that is catastrophic for the thousands of families and renters now facing the cliff edge of eviction. It is a wrong choice which follows from a series of wrong choices he and his Government have made on housing. He acknowledged the Government should have done more, but it has not done so and housing charities and local authorities are now warning that homeless services may collapse from Saturday. The Government's policy has failed and that is why we in the Labour Party have tabled a motion of no confidence.

For example, we have proposed in draft legislation the use of an evidence basis rather than a time basis for extending the ban. The Government has not even responded. It has not taken up our proposal because it just does not have the answers. Its conservative coalition is not working. It is all spin and no substance and it is failing the people. In the countermotion put forward by the Government last night to another constructive Opposition proposal, the Minister put forward much spin and very little substance. That amendment from the Government was all framed in the future tense - what it will do to address the housing crisis, not what it has done. It did not refer to the measures it should have been taking in the past five months while the eviction ban was in place. This catastrophic failure in housing delivery lies at the fault of Government. It is a failure of ideology, not of the economy. The State is running a €5.3 billion budget surplus, the highest in Europe.

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-03-29	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_7	"The independent review group report into the Defence Forces makes for shocking reading. It details really serious issues around a toxic culture that pertains in the Defence Forces. The report of the group chaired by Ms Justice Bronagh O'Hanlon makes findings over 50 pages and, on almost each of them, we see evidence of the abuse of members of our Defence Forces in Army barracks, on Naval Service boats, on overseas tours and elsewhere in the line of duty. Some of the shocking findings merit reading into the record of the House today. The report states:The types of bullying described ranged from behaviour leading to suicides (often characterised as ‘accidental deaths’) to serious physical assaults, very serious sexual assaults (including rapes), and the sexual targeting of new entrantsIt also states that ""interviewees described their experience of their training as literal torture and said that some members of their class took their own lives."" These are appalling findings. Both men and women have been affected and the findings relate to us that these issues and this culture endure to the present day. This is a culture we are told is gendered. Even though both men and women are affected, it is heavily gendered. We are told this culture at best ""barely tolerates women"" and that, at worst, it abuses women in its ranks. This is shocking to read. Everyone should have the right to go to work and carry out his or her duties free from harassment and violence and yet we see in the report that women members of the Defence Forces were advised to keep two locks on their bedroom doors to ward off those seeking to assault them as they slept. Some interviewees reported having to barricade sleeping quarters to prevent assault. They reported being groomed or spiked with alcohol or drugs. This is a horrific environment and all of us will want to send our thoughts and sympathies to all of those affected because it is hard to conceive of the terror these individuals must have experienced at work, realising that there was no institutional support, that they were unprotected and that people within the institution who made complaints were punished for doing so, with perpetrators moved on to work elsewhere. I pay tribute to the Women of Honour. The experiences they detailed have now been vindicated by this report. They showed great courage in speaking with RTÉ's Katie Hannon, to whom I pay tribute for her work in keeping this issue on the agenda. I am glad the Taoiseach has accepted the need for a statutory inquiry and I welcome that. However, will he give us a timeline for the establishment of that inquiry? It must be up and running before the Oireachtas rises for the summer at the latest to ensure we see speedy and timely work on the recommendations of the report. Furthermore, the Women of Honour must be involved. It is crucial that we see their engagement with the statutory inquiry. Can we be sure this sort of culture does not prevail in other State institutions? I am thinking of An Garda Síochána and of politics. We need to make sure we are not tolerating or enabling the continuation of these sorts of toxic workplace cultures."	spk_446
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-03-29	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_7	I thank the Taoiseach for the response and I echo his words of commendation for the immense work of, and the bravery shown by, members of the Defence Forces, who are renowned worldwide for their commitment to peacekeeping and for the immense service they have given on missions overseas for many years. However, I also acknowledge that, as the Taoiseach has said, the findings of this report make for alarming reading and disclose an ongoing and wide scale problem with the culture within the Defence Forces. I note the Taoiseach's comments about his Government's intention to work swiftly on this matter and to engage with stakeholders. That is crucially important but the time after the publication of a report like this is crucial and sensitive treatment is required. We are all conscious that, for those affected, reading the report and hearing public debate on it now that it has been published is very difficult and potentially very traumatic. I have represented some survivors of mother and baby homes and institutional abuse and they have told me how they found themselves traumatised again when the report was published, even though much of it vindicated what they had said and their experiences. It is therefore very important that neither the Government nor any of us traumatise these people again and that we move swiftly, although steadily, as the Taoiseach has said, to ensure that an appropriate response is given and that the terms of reference for this inquiry meet the needs of survivors. I again ask for clarity on a timeline and on the sequencing of the steps to be taken by Government to protect survivors.	spk_448

Will the Taoiseach commit to its immediate publication? We have learned that the review group, chaired by Ms Marie O'Shea, has recommended a more compassionate approach to the provision of reproductive healthcare. We understand it supports one of the measures we called for in our submission, that being, the removal from the legislation of the patronising and unworkable three-day wait. The State should not inflict more trauma and stress on women who are experiencing crisis pregnancy.I also query what the Government plans to do following publication of the report. As I said, we are looking for its immediate publication. I see reports that a special Oireachtas committee might be established on foot of the review. That might not be necessary. The Joint Committee on Health could engage in pre-legislative scrutiny of any legislative changes that will arise from the report's findings. It would be unnecessary to delay an evidence-based approach to amending the law based on the findings of this report. Can we see imminent publication and swift movement on the recommendations of the report?	spk_464

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-03-29	dail	33	Education and the School Building Programme: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_16	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire Stáit agus leis na Teachtaí go léir a labhair sa díospóireacht ar oideachas. On behalf of the Labour Party, I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, and the Minister, Deputy Foley, for their contributions and the support of all colleagues in the House who spoke on this important motion we in the Labour Party have submitted. I commend in particular Deputy Ó Ríordáin, our education spokesperson, who crafted the motion and spoke so powerfully about it. Our aim in tabling the motion is to see an improvement and build upon progress that has been made, and to acknowledge where more needs to be done to make our education system better for children. We have all acknowledged the progress that has been made and we have acknowledged fairly what more needs to be done. I wish to acknowledge a couple of transformative moments in the history of the education system in this State, starting with one related to a former Minister for Education from the Minister of State's party, namely, Mr. Donogh O'Malley, who in September 1966 made an historic speech announcing he would introduce free secondary school education with effect from 1967. At the time he made that groundbreaking announcement, 17,000 children finishing primary school education each year did not go on to second level. Consider the great progress that resulted from the announcement and the major contribution it made to the well-being and prosperity of our society. Another transformative moment, which Deputy Ó Ríordáin spoke about and which the Minister, Deputy Foley, acknowledged, relates to the enormous contribution of a Labour Party colleague, former Minister for Education Niamh Bhreathnach, who, sadly, died earlier this year but who, in her time as Minister, introduced pioneering reforms, notably the abolition of third level fees and the Breaking the Cycle programme, which she introduced in the 1990s. This programme would later be developed into the DEIS programme. As a result, we now see an enormous improvement in school completion rates and how we tackle poverty. We all know education is the key route out of poverty and disadvantage. Our motion seeks to build on these issues. In the brief amount of time I have before I hand over to my colleague Deputy Duncan Smith, I want to refer to three aspects of our motion in respect of which I believe things should and must improve. The first relates to school building. Colleagues have raised the issue of the 58 schools in respect of which we know building has been slowed down, delayed or paused. This is of genuine concern to all of us. I have raised this issue with the Minister and indeed the Taoiseach because it has affected four urgent school construction projects in my constituency, Dublin Bay South: Shellybanks Educate Together National School and Sandymount Park Educate Together Secondary School, both in Sandymount, and the two Educate Together schools, both primary and secondary, in Harold's Cross.I have had occasion to visit the campuses in Sandymount and Harold's Cross recently. These are hugely successful and rapidly growing school communities that are already outgrowing the buildings on site. They have been promised urgent construction on what are already busy sites and we learned very recently that the building works have been paused. This is causing consternation and distress among affected parents, children and school communities. The Taoiseach provided me with an assurance in the Dáil last week that additional funding would be provided this year to those four schools and others affected to ensure the resumption of the necessary works, but I noted that the Minister's contribution did not commit to that funding being provided this year so I ask the Minister of State to take this issue back to the Minister and the Government to ensure we see urgent progressing of paused construction works, not just in my constituency but also in respect of other affected schools. Others have spoken about school patronage. I very much welcome the Minister's commitment to see 400 multidenominational schools in place by 2030. However, I am concerned by the Taoiseach's recent remarks that he would not support a forced secularisation of the education system. That is a bad faith interpretation of what is proposed. All of us want to see the necessary choices for parents. All of us recognise the increasing number of parents who are choosing multidenominational schooling for their children and who want to move away from the former domination of our school system by the Catholic church in particular but by church doctrine, so I want to put that on the record.  In respect of autism and special needs and the significant need for children with special needs to have accommodation and decent and effective education systems, we still have far too many children who are left in limbo and with delays in diagnosis and finding school places. I pay tribute to the parents in my constituency: Involve Autism: D6/D6W & Surrounds; Neurodiversity Irishtown, Ringsend and Pearse Street; and Neurodiversity Sandymount, among other organisations who are working so hard to secure necessary places for their children. I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure the necessary resources are committed in terms of special needs assistants, SNAs, units and special classrooms to ensure all our children get the education they so urgently need.	spk_664

Clearly, we tabled a motion of no confidence which will be debated tomorrow, along with the Government counter motion. We are still awaiting a response to a reasonable and constructive proposal that we in Labour put forward to address the chronic shortfall in housing which means that many families will face a cliff edge of potential homelessness once the Government lifts the ban with effect from this Saturday, 1 April.	spk_86

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-03-28	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	In the week when so many families are facing a cliff edge of eviction in view of the ban on evictions being lifted on Saturday, we have learned that housing commencements have declined by 20% under the Government. That is 6,000 fewer new homes than at the same time last year. The Government has consistently over-relied on private developers to provide homes. The private market has proven that it cannot and will not deliver the affordable homes our country needs. The Housing Commission has reported that we will need 50,000 new homes each year to meet the needs of our growing population. This figure is much greater than the target in Housing for All, which, it seems, the Government is not going to meet. The drop in the number of commencements we are seeing will have a knock-on effect on housing delivery in 2023, with everyone already predicting a slowdown in construction. Will the Government revise the Housing for All target to 50,000 new builds per year in order to increase supply and to bring down rent levels and house prices? Will it ramp up State investment in the provision of social and affordable housing, particularly as the Land Development Agency, LDA, report indicates that up to 70,000 homes could be built on public land?	spk_101

It is just the most recent of many attempts by Opposition parties and individuals at a sensible and compassionate approach to the growing housing crisis. It is an attempt by us, across the Opposition benches, to offer Government a constructive way of addressing the impending cliff edge which so many families and renters face, starting from this Saturday, 1 April. Once again, I am disappointed to see the Government's amendment. I have read it carefully. It is essentially an expanded version of the amendment it put forward to the motion debated in the House last week. It is expanded and somewhat longer in content but, unfortunately, there is very little to add with regard to practical measures to offer to those facing the coming into effect of the notice to quit. I am looking at the sorts of measures that are set out in the Government's countermotion. Many of them are very welcome but the key is in the future tense used. We hear the ""Government will continue to support opportunities for the acquisition of properties to prevent homelessness"". We hear the ""cost rental tenant in situ backstop will be applied on an administrative basis from April 1st"" and that the Government ""will extend the Rent a Room scheme disregard for social welfare recipients"". We hear the Department is ""currently working with local authorities to bring on stream an additional 2,000 beds"" and that the Government is ""setting up a ""Acquisition Delivery Team"""". We hear the Government ""will support local authorities to acquire at least 1,500 social homes"" and ""is developing proposals for a bespoke cost rental model"". Those are welcome measures but they are measures in the future tense. They were not adopted or developed by Government during the past five or six months while the current eviction ban was in place. The Government acknowledges - I think buried on page 5 of the countermotion - that ""the eviction moratorium slowed down the numbers entering homelessness"". There has been something of a counternarrative coming from some of the Senators and Ministers of State who have been out defending Government on the airwaves in recent days. The reality is the Minister concedes the moratorium slowed down the numbers entering homelessness. It had that very important impact on those individuals who would otherwise be out of their homes. The no-fault eviction ban had a vital purpose. That makes the unexpected decision to lift the ban from 1 April even more indefensible, because this was a deliberate and conscious decision, the impact of which will be to see more families at risk of or entering homelessness from next Saturday. While much in the amendment is clearly admirable, it again gives little comfort to the families who are facing this cliff edge from Saturday. It reads as if it is again an attempt to give cover to those Deputies on the Government benches, but also Independent Deputies, who backed the Government last week and are feeling the pressure for doing so in their constituencies, because they are now understood to have supported an indefensible decision to lift the eviction ban without seeing the necessary and sensible contingencies put in place. To borrow a phrase from the late, great Labour Party Deputy from Limerick, Jim Kemmy, whose memory we honoured at the weekend at our party conference, all this amendment does is allow certain Deputies to play Mighty Mouse down in the constituency and Mickey Mouse up in Dublin, here in Leinster House, in voting with the Government. That is something we need to recognise, because nobody who voted for an Independent Deputy in 2020 voted to put people into homelessness or voted for evictions, and yet we need to be mindful that will be the impact of the decision the Government has taken. The discomfort of Deputies in voting with the Government, despite facing this backlash, will be nothing compared with the utter distress and devastation caused to those families who have been served a notice to quit and have nowhere to go. I urge Government and the Minister to recognise the reasonable nature of this Bill and to support it, because it is not too late to extend the eviction ban. It is not too late to reverse the eviction ban and reverse the decision the Government has made. This is the time to do so. All the allegations from Government of parliamentary theatrics, accusing us in Opposition of playing or posturing, show how out of touch it is with the real anxiety being felt by renters throughout the country. My motivation and that of my Labour Party colleagues in the measures we have put forward, especially in the tabling of the no-confidence motion, is to represent the people who are calling in to us and telling us their stories of hardship. Our motivation is to ensure we bring Ireland more into line with the norm in most European countries, where we see far greater protections for renters and sensible measures being adopted to address chronic housing shortages. However, most urgently, our motivation and that of everyone on this side of the House, is to keep people out of homelessness and prevent our homelessness services from collapsing, because we are all hearing from local authorities, housing charities and homelessness agencies of their utter, shall we say, failure to see how to cope with the numbers who will be coming forward to them. Buried in the text of the Government's countermotion, there is an acknowledgement of this. According to the motion, Government ""is aware of the challenges faced in sourcing emergency accommodation throughout the country and local authorities are working with the department to further increase capacity"". Those are not words that will offer great comfort to families facing eviction from this Saturday, because that does not suggest measures have been put in place or, indeed, that local authorities have the capacity to deliver the necessary emergency housing they are all telling us they will need. They are all telling us they are already at capacity. We are hearing from homelessness support workers who are burnt out already in seeking to address existing need, and that is before we see the additional need coming on track. It was only after the Minister had made the decision to lift the ban that we saw the figures from the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, telling us that nearly 4,000 notices to quit were served in the third quarter of last year alone. We are all getting a sense of the number of people who are affected. All of us acknowledged, when the temporary no-fault ban was put in place, that there were two purposes it would serve. The first was to give breathing space to those renting, to keep them from entering homelessness or, in what I think were the words the Government used, slowing down the numbers entering homelessness. That is considerably important if you are one of the families whose homelessness has been slowed down. It is perhaps an unfortunate term to use. The second purpose, of course, was to give breathing space to Government to address the chronic shortage and ensure homes would be put in place for people who are facing eviction. That is where there has been a real and serious failure by Government. What we are seeing now by those who are coming to us is an absence of anywhere to go for those who are being evicted. This has been recognised not just by those renting who are telling us of their distress and fear but also by landlords. In recent days, I have heard from several landlords pleading for an extension of the ban. They feel strongly about the Government's slowness in scaling up the tenant  We have been pressing the Minister on the tenant That was a cobbled-together series of motions put together at the last minute and not likely in any real sense to come into effect from Saturday. The Government's own Minister of State, Deputy Mary Butler, has criticised some aspects of those measures, which many of us understand are simply not practical to achieve in the short time available between now and Saturday. Not only did we put down a motion on 9 February putting forward a series of emergency measures that we called on Government to adopt. We also put forward a further constructive proposal, which I sent to the Taoiseach on 16 March, and put to him several times in the Chamber. I still have not received a response. It was a draft Bill to provide for a facility to extend the eviction ban on an evidence base. We called for the ban to be extended, again on a temporary, no-fault basis, until we see a demonstrable drop in homelessness figures over four consecutive months. The Taoiseach carped about how we would measure it, and why it was four months rather than one or two. What we are saying is that we need an evidence base. We need to see something beyond this time basis and references to meteorological conditions. Sure, as the Minister said in a response to a parliamentary question of mine, the winter eviction ban was based on the winter ban in place in France. He has done no modelling on the impact of lifting the ban at this time. He has done no modelling on the impact on landlords or renters of doing so. He has given us no indication that he has any basis in evidence, any rational basis, for lifting it at this time. We have offered an alternative approach motivated by the homeless agencies, the Simon Communities and others which have called for an evidence base to be adopted instead by Government. The Minister's refusal to accept our reasonable proposals, or reasonable proposals from others in opposition, such as Sinn Féin's Bill tonight, that failure has driven us, as a last resort and as a measure we do not take lightly, to put forward the motion of no confidence in the Government tomorrow. We are calling on all Independents to support us in voting no confidence in a Government that has chronically failed to deliver on housing."	spk_288

Everyone has a right to a home but the vote by Government and some Independent Deputies yesterday evening tells us that your belief in that right is qualified. Although motions are non-binding, yesterday’s vote sent a devastating message to people in housing distress and housing crisis right now. The vote copper-fastened the fear and anxiety for everyone in the country who is renting and who has received a notice to quit in recent months. It exacerbated the fear of those who have not received a notice to quit but are now in fear that they may be left without a home and may join the thousands of others who are homeless, left to fend for themselves in a rental sector which is in utter meltdown. As if to make matters worse, the Government has revealed itself to be in a tailspin. This week it announced a series of half-measures frantically cobbled together to shore up support for its position on the counter-motion. These measures are fundamentally incapable of making one iota of difference to all those due to be turfed out of their homes in nine days' time from 1 April onwards. Some of the measures are ill-defined, some appear to be antithetical even to the Government's own purported aims. We heard the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage revealing on the News at One yesterday that he himself was not sure how the proposed first refusal scheme for tenants facing eviction would work, a scheme likely doomed to fail since so few renters could even afford to buy. We saw in  At the Business Committee this morning, my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith confirmed that we will use our Private Members’ time next week to bring forward a motion of no confidence in Government. That is not something we do likely but something we have no choice but to do in the current circumstances. Even at this 11th hour, there is still time for the Tánaiste to reverse the decision and extend the ban. The Government has blocked off time on Tuesday afternoon for statements on the eviction ban. I do not think those statements will be of any use to the thousands of people who have already received a notice to quit. That time could be used to table the Labour Party's alternative Bill. The Tánaiste has accused the Opposition of having no ideas but we do have ideas. I wrote last week to the Taoiseach to supply him with a copy of our emergency legislation. I have a copy here which I can give to the Tánaiste. It would extend the eviction ban until homelessness rates have demonstrably reduced over four consecutive months. It would introduce a new approach, not indefinite extension, but a results-based, not time-based extension of the eviction ban, as the homelessness agencies have been seeking. The Taoiseach has not even done us the courtesy of responding but we are asking the Tánaiste now to take up our Bill. If he will not do so, in next week's motion of no confidence, can be sure he will have the support of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, or indeed of Deputy Hourigan? Is he confident of support for Government in next week's vote given the housing crisis and given the scale of catastrophe awaiting us from 1 April?	spk_281

It does not have a plan for what will follow for people who are facing homelessness from 1 April. What it presented this week was a series of last minute dot com measures cobbled together, measures which have no hope of meeting the real needs of households facing homelessness from 1 April.None of us is demonising landlords. We are conscious that small landlords are bearing the brunt of Government failure to ensure an adequate supply of homes for people. We are not just calling for an extension of the ban. On 9 February, the Labour Party put forward a series of eight emergency measures that we called on the Government to undertake during the duration of a ban to ensure that when the ban was lifted there would be sufficient homes to enable people to move on if they were evicted from their current homes. The reality is that the Government has no plan in place. The Government countermotion this week refers to a series of measures the Government plans to rapidly introduce. Why were these measures not introduced during the duration of the ban? Why did the Government not engage in modelling? It has no evidence base for lifting the ban. I want to put a question to the Tánaiste that my colleague, Deputy Ged Nash, tried to put yesterday. How much has it cost the Tánaiste and his Government colleagues to buy the votes of some Independent Deputies in order to evict thousands of people from their homes? This has come at a very high cost to the many renters now facing a cliff edge.	spk_306

The Government voted it down. It voted down our proposal for a series of constructive measures that would have served to increase the number of homes available to people. Despite positive indications the Government was going to extend the ban in the meantime, at the last minute it has confirmed that it will indeed lift it at the end of next week, in ten days' time. This decision is already causing immense distress and devastation to those families and renters throughout the country who are facing a cliff edge of eviction from 1 April. Since our motion was defeated, answers to parliamentary questions we received confirmed that the Government did not undertake any modelling as to the effect its decision would have on increasing homelessness. The responses from the Government have also confirmed that the primary consideration for choosing the duration of the ban in the first place was that of weather, meteorological conditions, which is incredible. Further responses confirmed that no new or clear direction was given to local authorities by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to mandate the purchase of homes occupied by renters facing homelessness. In other words, the Government has wasted the breathing space afforded to it by the ban. It could have used the six months the ban was in operation to plan, put contingency measures in place, added extra homes for people and added extra conditionality to ensure, for example, that landlords moving back into their own homes could be catered for. It is extraordinary and incomprehensible to all of us that the Government instead went ahead and decided to lift the ban from the end of next week without any plan B or any contingencies. Nothing the Government can float this week - and we have seen in the past 30 minutes apparently leaked details of the sorts of measures that will be in its countermotion - will help those who are due to lose their homes from the start of April. Nothing. No kite-flying this week will provide the reassurance parents who are contacting us need. These parents cannot bear the thought that they will have to take their children out of school because they simply cannot find another place to live in their own community. In my constituency, I hear from parents in this position. I hear from renters who will now face hours-long commutes because they cannot afford a home in a community near their workplace. It is not too late, even now at the eleventh hour, to reverse the Government's decision and to extend the ban.The Government should vote for the Opposition motion tomorrow, as it seems some Government Members are proposing to do. If the Government does not do so, the Labour Party has proposed a constructive alternative. As the Taoiseach knows, I wrote to him last Thursday with draft legislation which we are calling on the Government to move this week. Our legislation provides a mechanism to keep the ban in place until monthly homelessness reports show reductions for four successive months. This is a compassionate and evidenced-based approach. It is results-based rather than time-based and an approach that homelessness agencies have urged the Government to adopt. Will the Taoiseach admit that the Government has made a mistake? Will he stop defending the indefensible and reverse his decision? If not, he will leave us with no choice but to table a motion of no confidence in his Government next week. This is a measure we do not take lightly but it is one which we believe is justified by reference to the devastation the Government’s decision is causing to so many thousands of families and renters around the country.	spk_17

We listened to the Taoiseach’s fatalistic tone suggesting there is nothing that could be done during an extended period of an eviction ban. The point is that the eviction ban was to give the Government a breathing space to put in place the necessary emergency measures to increase the supply of homes and ensure there would be a safety net for families facing the cliff edge of eviction. The Government has done nothing for the past six months and has apparently just waited to see what will happen. It is simply not good enough to take the same approach now of waiting to see what will happen when the ban is lifted without having any contingency plans or safety net in place for those families now facing homelessness who have already been served notices to quit.

Decisions made this decade will have an impact lasting thousands of years. Although the window of opportunity is closing, the report makes clear that some feasible and effective options are available to us to reduce emissions. I will ask the Taoiseach about three of them. First, the report states we must phase out fossil fuels if we are to limit global warming. Countries will have to cease all licensing or funding of new oil and gas and stop expansion of existing reserves. Can the Taoiseach say that Ireland will ensure that exploration licences now in place are stopped from progressing any further? My second question relates to land use. When will the emission reduction targets for land use be agreed? When will the land use review be published? On SUVs and transport, yesterday we heard Professor Peter Thorne of Maynooth University warning of the climate consequences of SUVs, in the context of the number of these new diesel and petrol SUV cars on our roads being a big part of our climate problem.

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-03-21	dail	33	Northern Ireland	dbsect_9	The Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, confirmed that it will vote against the British Government's proposals on the Stormont brake on Wednesday. This is of real concern as it is a key part of the Windsor Framework agreement. The DUP's approach now indicates that, sadly, we are no closer to the restoration of the power-sharing Executive and the Stormont Assembly. This clearly has major political and practical implications for the people of Northern Ireland. We saw in recent weeks teachers and healthcare workers having to resort to strikes in the North due to unresolved issues and disputes about pay. We have seen the real prospect that 1,700 people in the community and voluntary sector who support those with disabilities will unfortunately lose their jobs on 31 March because of the end of European social funding initiatives. Dozens of organisations are at risk of closure, with many thousands of people who are supported by employability services impacted. The failure to restore the Executive as we approach the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement has very serious consequences. What next steps to seek the restoration of the Executive in Northern Ireland does the Taoiseach plan to pursue given this new indication from the DUP?	spk_121
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-03-21	dail	33	Departmental Meetings	dbsect_10	The UN IPCC climate report, published yesterday, represents a last wake-up call. Decisions made this decade will have an impact lasting thousands of years. Although the window of opportunity is closing, the report makes clear that some feasible and effective options are available to us to reduce emissions. I will ask the Taoiseach about three of them. First, the report states we must phase out fossil fuels if we are to limit global warming. Countries will have to cease all licensing or funding of new oil and gas and stop expansion of existing reserves. Can the Taoiseach say that Ireland will ensure that exploration licences now in place are stopped from progressing any further? My second question relates to land use. When will the emission reduction targets for land use be agreed? When will the land use review be published? On SUVs and transport, yesterday we heard Professor Peter Thorne of Maynooth University warning of the climate consequences of SUVs, in the context of the number of these new diesel and petrol SUV cars on our roads being a big part of our climate problem. Has the Government considered a progressive, weight-based tax, such as that introduced in France, to penalise the use of these fossil fuel-guzzling and extremely large SUV cars?	spk_136

In that context, have all Government records regarding the litigation and the proposals for law reform been released to the National Archives and are they now publicly available? This would include records from relevant Departments and the Office of the Attorney General, among other State offices. The releasing of all these records, and making them publicly available by way of an archive, would be a really great and positive way of marking, in particular, the 30th anniversary of this important law reform. Of course, cataloguing the records to make them accessible to researchers would be a huge part of that.

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-03-21	dail	33	Eviction Ban: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_14	"On behalf of Labour, I support the motion and commend Deputy Ó Broin and his colleagues for bringing it forward. It represents a sensible and compassionate approach to the growing crisis and the impending cliff edge that so many families and renters are facing. I cannot support, nor can my Labour colleagues, the Government amendment. I urge the Government and the Minister to recognise the reasonable nature of the Sinn Féin motion and to support an extension of the eviction ban. I have read the Government amendment and on careful reading I am even more puzzled as to why we are here. The following sentence jumps out at me from the Government's amendment:— To reduce the number of households at risk of homelessness Government plans to rapidly:— give tenants the ‘First Right of Refusal’...— expand the “First Home scheme”... Why did the Government not plan this rapidly five or six months ago?Why did the Government not put these measures in place while the existing ban was in effect? Why did it not use the breathing space that was provided? All of us, Government and Opposition, acknowledged there were two purposes to be served by this temporary no-fault eviction ban when it was first introduced. The first purpose was to give breathing space to families and renters to ensure they would not face eviction over the winter period. The second was to give the Government breathing space to put in place necessary measures to create an additional supply of homes, to ensure families who would be evicted once the ban was lifted would have somewhere to go and an alternative place to call home. What has not happened in the last five or six months is the implementation of those rapid plans the Government is now proposing. Families facing a cliff edge from 1 April have no safety net in place. They have only these proposals; I do not even think we can call them assurances. They have the plans the Government tells us it is going to put in place rapidly but there will be nothing there from 1 April. We are all hearing this from families and individuals in our constituencies. I know the Minister is hearing it. The homelessness agencies are hearing it and local authorities are hearing it. There is no emergency accommodation available. People facing eviction from 1 April do not know where they are going to go. That is a serious crisis. We are all hearing about the distress and devastation. People have told devastating stories but behind each story is an individual or a family. I am thinking of the young mother in my constituency who is distraught at the prospect of moving her children out of school because she cannot find an affordable place to rent in her own community once her eviction notice takes effect. I am thinking of the man in his mid-60s who asked me where he was going to get a mortgage. He is facing eviction. I am thinking of the elderly brothers who have been renting the same place for decades and their landlord now wishes to sell. They have nowhere to go. In my constituency of Dublin Bay South, 44% of households are in private rental accommodation. It is the highest rate in the whole State. There is nowhere to rent that is affordable. There is nowhere to rent. Out on the street earlier, I met somebody who told me they have been desperately looking for somewhere to rent that is in any way affordable in their own community. They cannot do it. They would have to change jobs or move out of Dublin. This is having a knock-on effect, as Deputy Ó Ríordáin pointed out, on schools. They cannot keep teachers or pupils as families are being forced to move out of Dublin because of unaffordable rents. It is not just Dublin. We are hearing about towns and villages around the country where there is no supply of accommodation available. It is against this backdrop that the Government took what appears to have been an unplanned decision to lift the eviction ban a number of weeks ago. I say ""unplanned"" because all the indications that I and other Opposition Members were given by the Taoiseach over recent months were that the Government was taking legal advice and seriously considering the extension of the eviction ban. We put down a parliamentary question about why the eviction ban was initially planned to end on 31 March. I was told by the Department that ""regard was had to the meteorological winter period"". The evidence for the duration of the plan in the first place referred to weather conditions, to the winter, and reference was made to the French winter eviction ban. My colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, asked the Minister just ten days ago if any modelling had been done by the Government towards the end of the eviction ban period on the impact lifting the ban would have. Apparently there was no modelling done on the impact on those renting or, indeed, on landlords. I listened carefully to the Minister's speech. He said that one of the reasons he took the decision to lift the ban was that if it were extended, he believed it would lead to a reduction in the supply of private rental accommodation. There is no evidence for that. We have heard anecdotally from landlords who wish to leave but what measures is the Government putting in place to incentivise landlords to stay, if that is indeed a key concern? Again, there is a lack of evidence and planning and a lack of contingency, and devastation and distress are being caused as a result. An extension could have bought further precious time for the Government to take up those rapid plans and put them into effect so those facing eviction would at least have some comfort in seeing that measures had been put in place. One of the measures I have been raising with the Minister for many months now is the tenant "	spk_260
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-03-21	dail	33	Eviction Ban: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_14	The Minister is right that there are 173 in the pipeline - that is also in the answer - but only seven have been purchased. I also hear from landlords who tell me they are trying to engage with local authorities, because they want to sell to a local authority to keep the family renting from them out of homelessness, and the local authorities are not engaging. I hear of other problems with the tenant  I put to the Taoiseach earlier that on 9 February the Labour Party tabled a motion, which the Government rejected, proposing to extend the eviction ban and put in place eight emergency measures that would have resulted in an increase in supply. The Government opposed that and it is now refusing to accept this motion to extend the ban in these circumstances of devastation for so many families and households. We have put forward a further constructive proposal, which I wrote to the Taoiseach about last week and put to him again this morning. We have brought forward a Bill that would provide for a facility to extend the eviction ban until there is an evidence base for its lifting, that is, until there is a drop in homelessness figures for four consecutive months. I understand the Taoiseach is not accepting that Bill even though it is a constructive proposal. We are going to have no option but to put down a motion of no confidence in the Government next week. It is not an action we take lightly. It is something we take very seriously. We are conscious that it is a very serious thing to do but we are in a situation where a decision has been made by the Government, apparently at very short notice and against what had previously been indicated, which is going to have devastating consequences for families and households around the country, in every constituency. It is being done without any contingency and with an admission from the Government in this very lengthy amendment to the motion that a series of rapidly planned measures do indeed need to be taken to keep families out of homelessness. These are measures that should and could have been taken months ago but because they were not, and because so many individuals and families are now facing this cliff edge, we are going to be left with no choice but to put down a motion of no confidence next week. I hope I am wrong. I hope the Government will change its decision. I hope it will support this Opposition motion, which has widespread support across this side of the House and from some members of the Government too, it would seem. I hope the Government will do that because the consequences of the decision are so clearly spelled out. I am thinking of the RTB figures we have seen since the Government took this decision showing nearly 5,000 notices to quit in the third quarter of last year alone. We are seeing real and clear evidence of this cliff edge and the devastation that is now likely to be faced by so many individuals and families. We, as Opposition legislators, cannot stand over that. I am appealing to the Minister one last time to support this motion, as we are doing tonight.	spk_262

I was further aghast to read a parliamentary question reply to my office this morning, setting out the criteria used to justify lifting the ban in this way at this time. In the four paragraph reply I received, meteorological conditions got nearly two paragraphs and pressure on homeless services got one line to justify the duration of the eviction ban. It is clear that the Government does not know the effect of the decision it has taken to lift the eviction ban with only three weeks to go until families start to get eviction notices. We are facing a social disaster and a potential tsunami of evictions in this country, with a return to the heartbreaking scenes we had some years ago of children having to sleep on the floor of Garda stations. This is a dreadful scenario and it is clear from the replies we got this morning that the Government has no evidence before it on the basis of which the decision was unexpectedly taken on Tuesday to lift the eviction ban.

Today, on International Women's Day, I welcome the announcement that a referendum on gender equality will be held in November. It is something I have worked on for a long time. As Chairperson of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality, I look forward to campaigning to bring the Constitution into the 21st century, to delete the sexist language around women and mothers, to replace it with gender-neutral language recognising care, and to see an inclusive definition of family introduced. We will welcome these changes, and we in the Labour Party look forward to campaigning and playing a leading role to ensure they are made. Today I want to raise two related feminist issues: housing and childcare. While we need to insert recognition of care into the Constitution, we need to ensure care policies do not work against women in this country today. An experience of a young woman, a constituent in contact with my office, illustrates how current Government policy on housing and care is failing her and her family. She and her partner welcomed a baby boy into their lives a year ago, which was wonderful news. However, as renters, they are being failed by the State's housing policy, and as young parents they are being failed by the State's childcare policy. They are faced with dire insecurity of tenure and are forced to stand in queues to seek a decent home for themselves and their child. The cost of childcare means they do not even know if she will be able to return to work because they cannot find a childcare facility with space near to where they currently live. At her local breastfeeding group, she was told she should have put her son on a childcare waiting list when she was still pregnant. Because they are renting with no security of tenure, when the current eviction ban lifts, which the Taoiseach's Government shamefully refused to extend yesterday, they do not know where they will live so they cannot put their names on a local waiting list. This Government is letting down this young woman and her family. On International Women's Day, I want to know what the Government proposes to do to ensure protection for my constituent, her partner and child, and for all of the families in their situation. Will the Government reinstate the eviction ban and move meaningfully towards a universal system of affordable childcare for all? In addition to the welcome referendum on gender equality, will the Government commit to holding a referendum on housing to ensure we see a right to a home within the text of our Constitution, our Bunreacht na hÉireann?	spk_161

That is welcome. However, we need to see Government policies on care and housing that recognise the difficulties and discrimination still faced by so many women, in particular. It is not just parents who are being failed. While there has been a welcome reduction in fees, there is a huge problem now for childcare and early years professionals. I met one young early years professional last week who told me she is forced to emigrate to Brisbane in Australia to work in her chosen profession, where childcare is valued, where she will receive decent pay and conditions and, critically, where she will be able to afford a mortgage and buy a home of her own. That is a right and prospect she is not being afforded in this country, where we see Government failure on housing, despite the moves the Taoiseach described on renters’ rights. It is simply not good enough. The cliff edge faced by many renters as the eviction ban comes to an end is likely to lead to a tsunami of evictions. We have heard this from homeless organisations and organisations working with renters. We hear it from our constituents all the time. They face this frightening prospect. What can the Taoiseach do for them? Will he be putting in place another eviction ban in the winter? He has to, because the policies his Government is pursuing are not delivering for renters.	spk_163

To address this, two years ago today, we publish the Organisation of Working Time (Reproductive Health Related Leave) Bill 2021 to provide up to 20 days paid leave for women who experience early miscarriage and up to ten days leave for employees undergoing IVF treatment. The Government initially expressed openness to this Bill in the Seanad but we were very disappointed when our amendments to the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022, which would have given effect to our legislation's provisions, were not accepted. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is undertaking research into the issue of early miscarriage leave, but the Government is running out of time in bringing in this much-needed legislation. I ask the Taoiseach that the Government take on our Bill in order to ensure leave is provided, particularly to women employees at such a difficult time when they are enduring early miscarriage or pregnancy loss. Currently, there is no provision in our law for any sort of leave entitlement.	spk_177

It is good to celebrate International Women's Day with these statements. It was good to celebrate with the women’s caucus earlier at the unveiling of statues of Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese in the hall of Leinster House. It is very good to hear that the Government intends to run the referendum on gender equality this autumn. I welcome that and thank the Minister for his kind remarks on the work of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality, which I was honoured to chair and which produced a report in December. Our report seeks the development of an action plan for the implementation of the 45 recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality. I thank the Minister and other Ministers for their engagement with the committee. I thank the members of the committee who gave so much time on a cross-party basis and all the stakeholders, civil society groups, experts, NGOs and others who engaged with us, particularly the members of the citizens' assembly and those with lived experience of discrimination. We heard from many people during our hearings and found their testimonies extremely valuable. The first three recommendations in our report and in that of the citizens' assembly relate to the constitutional change we are glad to see committed to in November. The strength of our report is we were able to devise and propose a precise wording for each of the referendums. The referendums would seek to do three things. First, they would insert express protection for gender equality in the Constitution in our equality guarantee, as well as for the principles of non-discrimination and equality generally. Second, they would delete the sexist and outdated language about women and mothers in Article 41 and replace it with a gender-neutral recognition of care. That is a hugely important and significant change which we must make. Third, we recommended the insertion of a more inclusive definition of ""family"", not limited to that based on marriage. We are hopeful and optimistic those changes will be put to the people in November, as the Government has said. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for setting out the timeline and I look forward to working with colleagues of all parties and none on achieving that necessary constitutional change. Such change is only the start of the work that needs to be done on gender equality. Our committee took the view that the 45 recommendations of the assembly, chaired so well by Catherine Day, represent a blueprint for achieving a gender-equal Ireland and need to be implemented in full. The report sets out an action plan addressing measures to be taken across an array of areas, particularly that of care. The Minister spoke of the changes made by Government on care and those are acknowledged but it is essential we move more swiftly to the publicly funded, affordable system of childcare the citizens' assembly asked us to implement. For too many women and men, lack of access to childcare and early years education is holding them and their children back. There is a failure to provide for an equal early years start for children. That needs to change. More generally, we recommended a national planning unit be implemented on care. We heard from caregivers and those receiving care about an absence of data and an absence of a structured framework for protection and valuing of care. The Taoiseach in response to a question I asked earlier referred to a care commission the Government proposes to set up later this year. Will the Minister say a little more about that? I am not sure whether that is a general commission on care to look at all facets from childcare and early years through to elder care. We were cognisant in our report of the need to ensure equality for women in the workplace. I acknowledge the progress made on gender pay gap reporting. I am sorry the Government still has not introduced the reproductive health leave and early miscarriage leave we in Labour have been pressing for. Two years ago today, we introduced a reproductive health-related leave Bill that would have provided, for the first time, recognition of the need for leave for early miscarriage for women. I hope we see more progress on that. We should acknowledge that the trade union movement originated International Women's Day when, in 1911, New York women garment workers went on strike demanding decent and safe work. Two years later in this jurisdiction, the Irish Women Workers Union struggled for basic pay and conditions in the 1913 Lock-out. The workplace is a key area where we need to see gender equality breakthroughs made. There are other areas which need action. Today the Irish Cancer Society told us of the need to amend maternity protection law in order to ensure that women undergoing cancer treatment will not forfeit any maternity leave. That is an important workplace-related issue for women’s equality. On domestic violence, I received confirmation from the Department of Justice yesterday that more than 4,700 reports were made to gardaí last year for breaches of protection orders and safety orders. We still lack the necessary refuge spaces for women. Women have been discriminated against in Irish society for far too long, including by means of incarceration in Magdalen institutions and mother and baby homes. Importantly, other speakers indicated that this is an international struggle. Women’s rights have been trampled on in recent year in Afghanistan and in Iran, where women are mobilising admirably in the face of a brutal regime. We think of the women of Ukraine suffering so much under the brutal Russian invasion, as well as women in Yemen, Palestine and other jurisdictions. Another aspect of the gender equality report we hope to see Government act on is women in politics. As our report says, until we achieve a representative democracy, our democracy will be unfinished. While in this House only 23% of Teachtaí Dála are women, we have not come near achieving the equal representation we so need. I recall the old suffragette slogan “Deeds not words”. Today on International Women's Day we need to see deeds and words, not just a commitment to a gender equality referendum but a commitment to extending the quota. Let us extend the quota from general elections to local and European elections. That would be a step toward achieving balanced representation in the Oireachtas."	spk_277

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-03-07	dail	33	Environmental Protection Agency (Emergency Electricity Generation) (Amendment) Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_13	I welcome the opportunity to speak for the Labour Party on the Environmental Protection Agency (Emergency Electricity Generation) (Amendment) Bill 2023. Our party whip, Deputy Duncan Smith, has already expressed frustration at the fact the progress of this and other legislation relating to energy has been compressed into such a short timeframe. Indeed, during the debate on the Development (Emergency Electricity Generation) Act 2022, I expressed frustration at the tight timeframe in which we were expected to submit amendments and deal with legislation on such an important issue as the security of energy crisis. This is a technical Bill and one of a series, an overall legislative package, as the Minister has said, required to facilitate delivery of 450 MW of temporary emergency generation capacity. It is essentially an emergency Bill and a technical Bill enabling due consultation by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, on licence applications relating to temporary emergency generation in the context of ensuring we mitigate the security of supply risk for winter of 2023-2024 and subsequent years. However, we will be forgiven for feeling this is like Groundhog Day and that a similar approach was taken to the winter we are still coming through. This Bill will further assist with allowing for works at Shannonbridge and Tarbert generating stations. In that context, we accept the need for quick legislative progress and will not be opposing the Bill. However, as I have said, we are concerned about the process and the fact this is just one of a series of Bills introducing emergency measures to ensure the security of energy supply. That is not good enough as a way of planning an energy policy. The nature of this series of Bills raises serious questions about failures in Government energy policy, failures in planning and the circumstances that have led us to a point at which we need to pass such emergency legislation again this year to secure energy supply not even for the long term but for the immediate future, the winter just ahead in 2023-2024. It also raises questions about how we can achieve the necessary steps to ensure we make the transition to renewable energy sources and a net-zero future. We are all conscious that a review of our energy security, led by Dermot McCarthy, is under way. I hope, and I am sure Government hopes, this review will lead us to a place where we can ensure more coherent long-term planning of energy security. It also has to be said we are debating this Bill in the context of an energy cost crisis. A great many households and individuals are contacting all of us because they are seeing massive increases in their energy bills, both for electricity and gas. This is feeding into a cost-of-living crisis for a great many squeezed households. Last week, I raised with the Taoiseach the fact that Electric Ireland had passed on the reduction in wholesale prices to business customers but not to households. The reasoning we were all given seemed somewhat spurious. We were told there was more of a delay in passing on cost decreases to households because of hedging policies. That seems extraordinary. I was reassured to hear the Taoiseach say in response to me that the Government will be introducing a windfall tax on the profits of energy companies, but we have been given no timeframe for that legislation. We have been looking for this for some time now. We in the Labour Party and other Opposition parties have been calling for a windfall tax. There would be support from the Opposition for the introduction of such a tax. The proceeds could help to alleviate bills for households. It is a source of frustration to all of us that we have been given no clear timeline by the Government, although the Taoiseach committed to the introduction of such a tax last week, which is welcome. Our concern is we may be back here again in another few months for another emergency Bill if long-term issues around energy security are not addressed. We have seen the briefing note provided to us. It says all potential options under the conventional planning processes have been ruled out as they would not enable delivery of the necessary emergency capacity within the limited timeframe. However, one must ask why this is so and why we have not by now put in place better capacity in the system. Thinking of the Derrybrien wind farm, we know that failure to comply with EU environmental laws can have serious consequences for planning security of supply. It is concerning that the State now appears to be reliant on exceptional and emergency measures to ensure security of supply for the winter ahead and future winters. I believe we would all accept this situation is the result of a flawed and failed electricity supply market and I believe there is agreement and acceptance that, where markets fail, it is incumbent on the State to step in to address that failure. However, this stepping in and this State intervention should happen in a more structured and strategic way rather than through a series of last-minute or emergency Bills. Why are we in this situation in the first place? It is because of a failure over successive years to scale up storage capacity. I have written to the Minister about this before and have raised it in the Dáil. It is also about a failure to scale up renewable energy and the ongoing failure to bring on capacity to generate wind energy offshore. We in the Opposition supported the introduction of the Marine Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, infrastructure and the new planning model to speed up the development of offshore wind capacity. There is immense frustration among stakeholders in the wind generation sector at the slow pace at which we are seeing offshore wind being developed. However, as the Minister himself has said, it could be a game changer for Ireland's energy supply. In that context, we in the Opposition have also raised issues around the data centre strategy and have sought to establish the Government's policy in respect of data centres. Is it going to listen to calls from the Opposition for a moratorium? We are conscious of the very significant impact data centres have on energy usage in this country.The electricity sector has a central role to play in combating climate change, which is clear from the Government's climate action plan and from international plans, but achieving our emissions reduction targets will involve putting much more electricity from renewable sources on the grid. That will arise, especially from generation through using offshore wind capacity. It is regrettable that Ireland's emissions increased again last year and that we are now purchasing 4.1 million credits from Slovakia to help meet our 2020 carbon emissions target at a cost, I understand, of €2.9 million. This is an extraordinary sum and it is a false economy not to invest, therefore, in our own infrastructure. The State is losing money through failing to meet our legal obligations and we are wasting money by having flimsy energy infrastructure and by failing to have planned for the future. Importantly, there is also a huge social cost to people who worry we will see blackouts over the winter ahead or who worry they will not be able to afford their own heating bills as they see these astronomical rises. We are seeing these concerns. People approach us, not only because they have received a bill with a big increase but also because of their fears about future increases to come and about the failures of energy companies to pass on wholesale reductions to them. There is a huge social cost. It generates fear among many households. They are fearful because of price-gouging providers. They are fearful our creaking energy infrastructure will not manage. That is why it is crucial we see development of large-scale capacity to store electricity, particularly as we move towards bringing on greater capacity to generate through offshore wind. I will speak a little more about Mr. Dermot McCarthy's energy security review. Others have sought clarity as to when that will be produced and when we will see it published. My question is how we will go about seeing the recommendations likely to be in the report implemented in a measured and structured way? How will we see a coherent longer term strategy adopted by Government which will mean we will not need to be back before the House with yet more emergency legislation to guarantee energy security over this coming winter and other winters ahead? We need to hear more about that more long-term vision. The Minister's speech focused of necessity on this Bill, on the measures it contains and on those emergency measures necessary to see us through the winter ahead. As I say, my party is not opposing the Bill. However, we also need that bigger debate about where we will see energy security policy going, that focus on offshore wind, bringing on more renewables, a data centre policy, and a clear account from Government as to how we will guarantee energy security while meeting our necessary climate emissions targets.	spk_158

On Monday I visited Sligo with our local area representatives Nessa Cosgrove and Bernie Linnane. I visited an important childcare and family support service, Sligo Springboard Family Support Service, which is based in Cranmore in Sligo town. It has provided vital services over the past 20 years for local children and families in a disadvantaged area. The services it provides include a bus service to and from school, a breakfast club and an after school and homework club. Its work has led to a consistent increase in school attendance in the area. Due to a chronic lack of funding at present it does not have enough money to cover the costs of running the service. Facing any increase in heating bills or energy bills or any unforeseen cost is a constant source of worry. At present 32 children are engaged with the service.

Another group of people, who are already homeowners, are also being failed by current Government policy. These are homeowners who, because of interest rates, are seeing their monthly outgoings on mortgage repayments rising by hundreds of euro every month, with more interest rate hikes in prospect. People despair of being able to budget effectively for their household bills because of this increased outgoing they face every month. They are in homeownership but despair of being able to meet mortgage repayments and are very fearful of what the future holds, if they are not on fixed rates. Will the Taoiseach consider adopting the proposal of my colleague, Deputy Nash, to cap mortgage rate hikes, and introduce legislation to do so, in order to offer something to that squeezed middle?	spk_100

We know that there is an energy bills crisis and that the crisis is not new. Indeed, it is now 13 months since we in the Labour Party brought forward a Dáil motion on the cost-of-living crisis and energy prices. While the situation was severe a year ago, it is intolerable now. We saw the latest Central Statistics Office, CSO, survey on income and living conditions confirm that the number of people at risk of poverty rose by 76,000 last year and that this rise was driven by an increase in the number of older people at risk of poverty. Our Labour Party representatives have been hearing from pensioners who have had to resort to taking out credit union loans just to meet the cost of their energy bills. Adding insult to injury are the unfairness and inequity of the crisis and the Government's hands-off approach, which has exacerbated that unfairness. We now see wholesale electricity prices falling but providers refusing to pass that benefit on to working families and households. All the while, companies are reaping record-breaking, eye-watering profits. Now we see that Electric Ireland is to cut small businesses' electricity bills by 10% from tomorrow. This is welcome news for SMEs, which we know are struggling to break even. Electric Ireland has also confirmed, however, that it will leave household charges untouched.	spk_6

Where is the fairness in that? We are looking for a sense of urgency from the Government and we are looking for a sense that mere words of encouragement are not the strongest response it can provide. Previously, during Leaders’ Questions, I raised with the Taoiseach the scandal of district heating companies charging ridiculous amounts, up to four times more, for energy than other households pay. I have heard the Minister say that is a matter for the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, which is not good enough. I have spoken before about the need for the Government to take the Corrib gas field into State ownership to enable us to control gas prices and reduce bills but again the Taoiseach has said such a move is beyond the Government’s control.

It is time for a more urgent sense of intervention by the Government on this issue because it seems to people nach bhfuil an Rialtas ag déanamh aon rud. The Government is not doing anything for people who are seeing this inequity. It is amounting to a quadruple whammy because we have seen the magnitude of energy providers' profits and we have seen the inertia and delay in the Government's approach to a windfall tax. I am glad that the Taoiseach has confirmed that will be introduced and that the Government is looking at the super dividend approach. However, we need to know when that will happen.The third thing we are seeing is the extortionate charges on household and, fourth, the inequity where we see reductions in wholesale prices being passed on to businesses but not to families and households. There are increasingly questions about the rationale being offered by energy companies. Electric Ireland suggested that there are hedging contracts that prevent it from moving on household bills as swiftly as it is moving on business bills, but business groups are questioning this so-called explanation and this idea that hedging contracts must necessarily lead to a time lag between wholesale price falls and reductions in bills for households. It is simply not good enough. It is good to hear the Taoiseach agree with me on the hardship that individual families and households are facing but it is not good enough that the Government is simply acting as a bystander and adopting this wait-and-see approach without acting urgently to intervene to ensure households will see the necessary reductions in their bills.	spk_14

I also note that tomorrow we are marking one year's anniversary of the brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine. I know we had a moment's silence in this House earlier to mark that. I commend Deputies Wynne and Andrews for bringing forward this important legislation which we in the Labour Party are very happy to support. The Minister of State has pointed out that it is similar to other Private Members' Bills introduced previously. That just shows the level of support and the need for introducing legislation like this. I acknowledge the presence with us of the ""Add the 10th"" campaign which we are glad to support, members of the INOU and others. There has been a very strong civil society campaign around the need to add a tenth ground of discrimination into our equality legislation to join the nine grounds already there in those Acts. I will speak more about the equality legislation in a moment.  I acknowledge the point made by the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, that there is a review of the equality legislation under way, in accordance with the commitment in the programme for Government. We are all very conscious of that. I am glad to hear confirmation that a report is to be published shortly arising out of that review and indeed that the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, intends to bring forward legislative proposals. It is good to hear about that progress. However, it is disappointing that the Government has put down an amendment in respect of this Bill to require that the Second Reading be delayed for 18 months. That strikes me as being far too long given the review is under way and the Minister of State has said a report is to be published imminently, certainly this year, and that there are legislative proposals under consideration. It would seem too long a period to defer a Second Reading of this Bill. Other Government amendments in respect of Private Members' legislation in this term have referred to shorter deferral periods. It is an unreasonably long period given how much work is under way, that there have been Private Members' Bills on this issue before and that there is a strong civil society campaign. Obviously it is up to Deputy Wynne to decide whether to accept or oppose the Government amendment.  We do have instances of other Private Members' equality Bills that have passed more speedily through the Houses with cross-party support. In 2015, I was glad that as a Senator my Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act to prevent discrimination against LGBT individuals by religious-run institutions, schools and hospitals was brought into law. I share that experience to remind the sponsors of the Bill and the Government Ministers that through collaboration, Private Members' Bills on equality matters do have the potential to make progress on important equality initiatives.  The equality agenda is far from complete, as we know. The Bill before the House seeks to prohibit discrimination on the basis of a really critical ground, that tenth ground of social and economic disadvantage, class background in other words. It is legislation which aims to put in place provisions rejecting snobbery and class prejudice. On that principle we can all agree on the need to reject that particular ground of discrimination. I note that the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has joined us. I am conscious that research published by his Department just last year, in 2022, clearly highlighted the impact of this sort of discrimination in revealing that children from a disadvantaged class background were more likely to experience discrimination on the basis of their place of birth or parentage compared with children from more advantaged social classes. The same research found that unemployed adults were the second most likely group to experience some form of discrimination after those of a non-white ethnicity, with 30% of unemployed adults compared with 33% of those from a non-white ethnicity. This is some of the data which establish what we all know to be true, that this form of class-based discrimination is prevalent in society and that legislation is needed to prohibit it. In recent weeks, the impetus to stamp out discrimination of all kinds has been brought into sharp focus. As a society and as legislators we have a political and moral obligation to call out and eradicate bias and hate wherever it arises, on whatever ground and in whatever form. As per the trade union slogan, an injury to one is an injury to all. Strengthening equality legislation is something that we as legislators can do in a practical way to address discrimination. We in the Labour Party are proud of our legacy, particularly that of the former Minister, Mervyn Taylor, the first Minister with responsibility for equality. He pioneered the equality legislation the review of which is under way. He pioneered, indeed, the inclusion of nine grounds of discrimination. I am thinking also of the contribution of another former Labour Party Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, who recently died, very sadly. We all are most sorry to see her sad passing. I was reminded of her work on this by a tweet from Kieran Rose, the co-founder of the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN. He reminded us of the role Niamh had played in the development of the original equality legislation. He reminded us that the Bill as originally drafted was confined to discrimination on the basis of sex and marital status. This was a Labour Party Private Members' Bill from 1990 which was the forerunner and created the passage to the equality laws we have today. Niamh, alongside Dick Spring and Mervyn Taylor, met with GLEN, members of the Traveller community, activists from ethic minorities and other organisations.Following that consultation with civil society, the Bill became much more inclusive. Despite being narrowly defeated in the Dáil later, it formed the bedrock for the equality legislation Mr. Mervyn Taylor, the then Minister responsible for equality, introduced in the 1990s. That was pioneering legislation dealing with nine grounds of discrimination but we know that the tenth ground, that of socioeconomic status or class, should be added as a recognised one. We all have heard stories about the lived experiences of those who have suffered bias, prejudice and discrimination on grounds of class, but currently there is no form of legal redress. Last year, members of the gender equality committee, which I chair, heard very clearly during its hearings about experiences of intersectional discrimination. I am referring to women who were discriminated against not just because of their gender but also because of their class, ethnicity or disability. We are very conscious that part of the process or mechanism we put in place for challenging intersectional discrimination must refer to socioeconomic class. My constituency, Dublin Bay South, is proudly diverse but I hear from constituents who have had the insidious form of class discrimination in question directed against them. I am always frustrated to have to inform them they have no legal basis for recourse currently. For example, I know the management of certain pubs and bars in my constituency have asked clients to leave, citing their dress, in spite of the fact that the pubs are often full of people wearing very casual clothing. Those who have told me about this very insidious form of discrimination have clearly reported they experienced it because they identified as working class. They believe it was because of an accent or particular look. One person told me that when applying for her first job, she gave her home address, which is in a very identifiable complex in a disadvantaged area in south Dublin. She could not find a job; there was none available to her. One year later, she set out again, seeking work at the same places of employment, this time giving the address of a relative in a less disadvantaged area, an area perceived to be more advantaged. Almost immediately, she started getting interviews and job offers. These are obvious examples that we all hear about. As legislators, we do have to address this. If this is a pernicious and pervasive form of discrimination, we must recognise it in our laws and address it legislatively. I very much welcome the fact that the Government has committed to examining the introduction of this new ground of discrimination based on socioeconomically disadvantaged status. All of us in opposition very much welcome the conduct of the review of equality legislation, including an examination of the incorporation of the tenth ground. However, given the amount of work under way and the cross-party consensus that seems to exist in both the Government and Opposition benches, we could move more swiftly. There is no need, therefore, to put in place an amendment delaying further progress on this Bill for 18 months. That is likely to bring us beyond the term of this Government and therefore it is just too long a delay. Among the measures that the gender equality committee recommended should be adopted by the Government was a constitutional referendum on equality that would broaden the equality guarantee and make it more inclusive, as well as taking out the sexist language about women and replacing it with language that values and recognises the contribution of care in our society. We also recommended a related amendment to recognise more inclusive and diverse forms of family. It would be very positive if we could see this year a commitment to adopting the Bill or provisions within it and also hold the equality referendum that the gender equality committee and citizens' assembly have called for."	spk_321

Yesterday, the Taoiseach revealed to me in this House that the Government will make a decision on whether to extend the eviction moratorium in the next two to three weeks. The current moratorium will end on 31 March. By the Taoiseach's own account, the Government is giving itself until 15 March to make a decision. However, people across the country have already been given notices to quit and many families are counting down the days until they will be without a home. Does the Taoiseach think it is fair to leave those renters in limbo? It is important to say that the eviction ban was only ever as useful as the actions taken while it has been in place. Despite all the backslapping by Government Deputies and Ministers and the endless spin, the Government has not used that time well. It should have been a productive breathing space to provide additional accommodation for people. While some building targets may have been met, the Government's advice indicates that it has set them far too low.

This is a shamefully low figure. The Taoiseach states that he understands the scale of the crisis, but yesterday's mini-budget did not contain a single housing support for renters or homeowners. When will we see real emergency measures adopted by the Government to tackle the housing crisis? Will the Taoiseach please announce today the extension of the eviction ban because timing is crucial. It is crucial for families. We are halfway through the school term. We are just a few short weeks away from the leaving and junior certificate examinations and third level assessments. We are also seeing a spate of job losses. Today's announcement by Google, in my constituency, is just the latest. The Government is taking its time, however. It seems to have made a decision that there is no rush on this and is taking its time in consulting the Attorney General. It also seems to be assuming that families in rented accommodation do not require certainty now, but they do. The official figure for the number of people who are homeless stands at 11,632. That includes 3,442 children. We know people leaving the private rented sector represent a sizeable cohort of those now entering homelessness. It is unconscionable, therefore, to delay the decision any longer. Last Wednesday, 15 February, Government Deputies voted down a Labour Party motion that would have extended the eviction ban on a temporary basis through to the end of this year. This would have given the Government a longer breathing space to deliver the necessary homes. Tonight, we are telling the Government that it has a second chance in this regard. There will be another opportunity for us all to vote to extend the eviction ban. I am asking the Taoiseach if, at the eleventh hour, he will right the wrong and vote to give certainty to people facing homelessness in a matter of weeks, namely, at the end of next month.	spk_116

As it happens, the Labour Party was happy to sign up to the original draft of the motion circulated to us by Government. We believe it is very important that all of us, on a cross-party basis, express solidarity with the people of Ukraine in the way that was originally intended. When that motion was not agreed, we understood a new version might be circulated for statements tomorrow. This announcement was made by the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, just as that motion was being circulated to us. My email states that it came in at 12.42 p.m., which was five minutes ago. There is new wording which we have not seen. Many of us are due to speak in this House between now and when that motion is due to be taken. It is very unfortunate that we would see this matter being handed in such a divisive way. This is something on which we should all be able to come together to express solidarity. As others have, I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, to withdraw the motion and bring it back for discussion tomorrow, which indeed is closer to the crucial and terrible one year anniversary on Friday. That would have been a better way to have dealt with this, rather than to try to infiltrate and shoehorn it into today's business schedule, which is fairly packed. That is not appropriate. It would have been better to do it tomorrow, as we had understood it would be.	spk_162

For those of us who signed up in good faith to the original text of the motion - I have now read the Government's proposed motion that just came through - it is most inappropriate that there is such a short timeframe for Opposition leaders to prepare significant enough speeches of five or ten minutes. This is most unfair and it is most unfortunate to do this about such considerably important issues. As the Ceann Comhairle said, there are so many Ukrainian citizens here who have an entitlement to expect a reasoned, compassionate and thoughtful debate on this important motion, as we mark the anniversary of this brutal invasion by Putin of a democratic, sovereign country in Europe. It is very unfortunate it is being done in this way and I do not see why it cannot be done tomorrow, as was originally intended.

My thoughts today, like those of all of us, are with those individuals who are affected by this announcement and with their families. Of course, the job losses will impact those employed by Google within my own constituency of Dublin Bay South, in particular, where Google has a very significant presence. Indeed, it has a significant level of engagement with local communities in Ringsend, Irishtown and around Pearse Street and the south-east inner city. I acknowledge that staff have been informed and that Google has notified the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and public representatives in the area, including me. That is welcome, but it is of huge concern to see these announcements being made. We are conscious that it represents only 4.3% of Google's Irish workforce, so it is less than the 6% cut being applied globally by Google. That is one small positive. I wish the employee representatives well as they enter talks in the consultation period.

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-02-22	dail	33	Anniversary of Russian Invasion of Ukraine: Motion	dbsect_22	As we mark the first anniversary on Friday of Russia's brutal and horrific invasion of Ukraine just one year ago, I am proud to speak on behalf of the Labour Party. I start by paying tribute to the immense courage and resilience of the Ukrainian people as they have experienced the horrific firepower of Russia over the past year. I pay tribute to President Zelenskyy, his Government and our friend here in Ireland, the Ukrainian ambassador, H.E. Larysa Gerasko, for her steadfast advocacy on behalf of her country and her people. As the brutal Russian invasion continues, we have learned of horrific war crimes in Bucha and across other cities and towns, and about the appalling siege of civilians in Mariupol some months ago and the atrocities and war crimes committed, in many cases against women and children, by Russian forces in a peaceful and democratic country in Europe. There has been devastation in the Donetsk region and enormous displacement of people, with some 6 million internally displaced in Ukraine and 8 million refugees recorded across Europe. That figure represents about 19% of the Ukrainian population as of 2021. We have seen tens of thousands killed, between civilians and soldiers, and that sad death toll continues. Just this morning there was a report from UNICEF about the horrific impact on children of injuries and deaths as a result of mortar bombs from Russia. These reports have horrified us all and they show the need for an intensification of our collective response. While we in the Labour Party have welcomed the rounds of EU sanctions and welcomed the expulsion by the Government last year of four diplomatic staff from the Russian embassy, we believe stronger measures need to be taken. Indeed, President Zelenskyy in his address to these Houses last year called on us to do that and told us our leadership can make a difference. I am renewing my call for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador from Ireland as he continues to mount brazen denials of the truth of what is happening in Ukraine and what his Government is doing to the people of Ukraine. We are also calling for the Irish Government to show strong support for Ukraine's expedited accession to the EU and for an urgent initiation of investigations into Russian war crimes against civilians. We are calling for speedy passage into law of Deputy Howlin’s Magnitsky legislation, which the Labour Party brought forward in the Dáil in December 2021, before the invasion, and which would give significant additional powers to sanction Russian war criminals. Putin has shown that he wants to wipe Ukraine off the map. He wants to abolish Ukraine's culture and its history. He must fail and he will fail. We are a militarily neutral country and we are very proud in the Labour Party of defending our military neutrality, but we must not and cannot be politically neutral in the face of this brutal aggression from the Russian leadership. Putin is the aggressor; he is the bully. There is no moral equivalence and that is why we in the Labour Party are happy to support the wording of the Government motion, which unequivocally expresses solidarity with the people of Ukraine and takes a clear stance against Russian aggression. It is also why we cannot support the amendments put forward. Indeed, we believe they are misguided because they suggest a moral equivalence. In condemning NATO and calling for an immediate ceasefire, they suggest there is an equality of bargaining power on both sides. They undermine or choose to ignore the fact there is one bully and aggressor here. We cannot be morally or politically neutral in the face of that aggression. This is personal for me. My grandfather was imprisoned by the Nazis and then fled his home country of the Czech Republic because he foresaw the Soviet takeover there. He found refuge here in Ireland with his young family, including my father, who was born in the Czech Republic. He re-established Waterford Glass and there is now a plaza named for him in Waterford. His contribution shows the immense benefit to Irish society and the Irish economy of inward migration. My father's home country, the Czech Republic, has taken in 400,000 Ukrainian refugees, which is the highest number per head of population in Europe. I am proud of that response in the Czech Republic but I am very proud that we in Ireland have taken in such a high proportion as well. We have taken in 77,000 Ukrainian refugees. That is a matter of pride, and communities across Ireland have shown such immense solidarity and generosity in welcoming Ukrainian refugees here. The Government needs to show a more co-ordinated approach in meeting the needs of refugees in the communities that are welcoming them. We need a strong public information campaign. I want to pay tribute to all of those who are involved in the collective national effort, including the Ukraine civil society forum and Ukrainian Action in Ireland, in helping Irish hosts here. We in the Opposition want to play our part in that national effort of welcoming Ukrainian refugees who are fleeing such appalling carnage and brutality from Putin. There is immense solidarity here in Ireland with the Ukrainian people and that is why it is important we have a cross-party consensus on this simple Government motion calling for solidarity with Ukraine and calling for condemnation, outright and unequivocally, of the brutal bullying tactics of Russia. We stand, collectively, with Ukraine in this House. We stand with Ukraine in Ireland. 	spk_289

This is an admission that the Taoiseach and the Government got it wrong in budget 2023 and that wages and social welfare payments in particular are still too low. After these new one-off payments are made, the reality is that incomes will still be too low and will not keep pace with inflation and skyrocketing prices. We know 1 million people have fallen into poverty and one in five working people is officially low paid. We have heard about pensioners taking out credit union loans just to meet the cost of exorbitant energy bills. We know one-off payments cannot mitigate against the failure in the previous budget to increase sufficiently the minimum wage and minimum basic social protection rates, including pensions, carer's allowance and the fuel allowance.Why will the Government not increase the minimum wage to at least €12 per hour in this mini-budget and why will it not increase social welfare rates by a further €8 per week, as per our calls and the calls of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Social Justice Ireland and others?	spk_51

All of us want to ensure that Ireland is in the first category rather than the second, showing leadership on climate and not lagging behind others. Let us look to some examples of leadership by different governments. In Wales, the Labour Government has taken the radical decision to halt future road-building projects due to climate concerns. In France, the Government is moving to ban short-haul flights where a decent rail alternative is available. In Australia, state governments are turning down mining licences to avoid further damage to the coral on the Great Barrier Reef. Closer to home, the European Parliament has voted to ban the sale of new combustion-engine cars by 2035. Politics is about choices, as we know, and change is always a choice. For a great many years, Ireland was labelled internationally as a climate laggard. The passing of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, which we all supported, marked an important step in this country’s path to a cleaner environment and a safer future, and to positive change on climate. As in so many areas, this Government’s approach to climate action since then has been strong on rhetoric and the setting of targets but weak on delivery and the achievement of targets; more laggard than leader. It does not help that many of those supporting climate action within the Government are so regularly undermined by others in the coalition Government, although I have to say that looking across the floor today, it looks more like a single-party government than a coalition.	spk_221

When we are asking people to come along the way with us to a net-zero future, we need to see the Government introducing climate action policies which will show benefit in the short term. We need to see carrots and not just sticks. We need incentives and not just sanctions when it comes to climate action. Yesterday, the Taoiseach confirmed to me during Leaders' Questions that the ""I-can’t-believe-it’s-not-a-budget"" mini-budget will be launched next Tuesday. We will hear some clarity then as to the measures to be introduced and that is welcome. Can the Tánaiste give assurances that the mini-budget package will be targeted and sustainable and that the measures introduced will be environmentally proofed? I know that there is disquiet in the Green Party that in addition to being insufficient to make a difference to the bills of the most hard-pressed families, untargeted electricity credits may also have done little to progress climate action. This is a real concern with that particular measure. As part of Tuesday’s package, why not adopt instead the Labour Party proposal for a €9 climate ticket that we put forward last October? Modelled on the scheme in Germany, the ticket would enable people to take unlimited public transport journeys on trains, trams and buses for just €9 per month. This would have a significant impact on emissions, equivalent to taking 23,000 cars off our roads. It would also help people to make the move to public transport and assist in addressing the cost-of-living crisis. We are seeing other jurisdictions taking leadership on climate. In next Tuesday's mini-budget, will this Government be taking leadership on climate measures too?"	spk_223

I will be speaking at the Ireland For All rally this Saturday to show solidarity with those who have come here seeking refuge. I also look forward to speaking at an event on 24 February, organised by the Ukrainian community, to mark the anniversary of the brutal war. In his response to me on the measures to be introduced on Tuesday, the Tánaiste has given no reassurance as to their environmental impact. I appreciate that the Tánaiste has said that he wants to see more radical measures on public transport, so why not adopt the Labour Party proposal on a climate ticket? It is a radical proposal that would have a significant impact on the cost of living for so many hard-pressed families and individuals, as well as having a strong and positive environmental benefit.The Tánaiste has spoken of the high fuel cost for so many families. Indeed, I raised the matter yesterday with the Taoiseach. What will the Government be doing on the fuel allowance? What will happen for hardworking families who are really pressed on energy bills? Finally, I wish to state that it is important that we show leadership in this House too. Earlier this week, I wrote to the Ceann Comhairle, asking that we adopt a clearer set of environmental policies in this House in terms of recycling, the segregation of waste, as well as on support for cycling and EV facilities in the House. 	spk_225

Crucial to any work on this absolutely vital issue is ensuring an adequate supply of quality affordable childcare and early years education for all children. I want to know specifically how the Government will address the severe shortage of preschool and early years places across many communities. As just one example, I raised with the Taoiseach the research from Young People at Risk, a group of childcare professionals and others operating under the north-east inner city task force. This group found that one in four children in the north-east inner city is without any place in early years education. That chimes with my experience in my constituency of Dublin Bay South. Every week, I hear from parents who are distressed at being unable to find any affordable childcare or early years education places for their children.

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-02-16	dail	33	Co-ordination of International Protection Services: Statements	dbsect_32	I welcome this debate and am glad to have the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Labour Party. It is particularly timely as next week, 24 February, is the sad first anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine. It is 12 months since Vladimir Putin began waging his brutal war on Ukraine. Such devastation, destruction and suffering has been inflicted on the people of Ukraine since then, with the war crimes in Bucha, the siege of Mariupol, devastation in the Donetsk region and reports of spates of war crimes, including sexual crimes, against Ukrainian women and children by Russian soldiers. It is a campaign of death and destruction in Europe the likes of which we had all hoped we would never see again.This week, the UN estimated that more than 7,000 civilians, including hundreds of children, have been killed. We know the death toll is likely to be significantly higher as the conflict has hampered humanitarian efforts, rescue efforts and efforts to count the dead. Tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides have been also killed. We also know that the displacement of people has been enormous. Some 5.9 million people have been internally displaced in Ukraine and 8 million refugees have been recorded across Europe. We have a welcome debate this afternoon on how we can do right by those fleeing devastation and seeking sanctuary on our shores. It is not just people fleeing the brutal war in Ukraine but also those fleeing conflict and persecution in other countries. I refer to those who are fleeing the devastating consequences of climate change and those who may well now be looking to flee from the horrific earthquake in Türkiye and Syria. We have an ethical responsibility and a moral duty to provide shelter to those who come here seeking refuge. I welcome the Government's commitment. In terms of the Ukraine conflict, while we are militarily neutral we cannot be politically neutral in the face of this horrific Russian aggression. As all speakers have acknowledged, there has been immense decency and humanity shown in communities across the country. A great welcome has been rolled out to those who have come here fleeing persecution and a great deal of community support, decency and humanity. Unfortunately, however, a small number of those on the political fringes have been seeking to undermine the immense generosity of spirit and have been making attempts to sow division. The sinister action by a small number of individuals must not be allowed to overshadow the overwhelming welcome that has been shown by most people in most communities. I look forward to joining with so many others from across the State on Saturday afternoon for the Ireland for All solidarity march, which will show the extraordinary warmth and generosity people across the county feel for those who have come here. However, issues with the accommodation of people arriving here have arisen. As the Taoiseach acknowledged in his opening remarks, some are now being left without shelter, which is appalling to see. A more co-ordinated response is required from the Government. We in the Labour Party have tried throughout the past year to be constructive in the face of this crisis: offering positive solutions to alleviate pressures on the system and to help support what must be a national, collective effort. In preparation for today I consulted extensively with the Ukraine Civil Society Forum, the One Foundation, those co-ordinating the front-line community response, and others to try as best I can to see what front-line responders require as well as what those who have come here themselves seek. There are three headings under which we need to see a more centralised and co-ordinate response from the Government. The first is information. The second is the provision of accommodation and the co-ordination of that effort. The third is community support. The information vacuum has been exploited by a small number of sinister actors. We have seen a lack of a central message from the Government on the benefits of inward migration, the reality of the conflicts and the brutality that so many are fleeing to come here. What we need to see is the roll-out of a national information campaign, as we saw during the Covid pandemic. That was done successfully by the State to counter the myths and disinformation about vaccines that were being spread. We had a very successful vaccination programme in Ireland as a result of that. Let us see that level of public information campaign rolled out now on refugees and migration and the benefits of inward migration to Ireland. As part of that information, we need a clearer channel of communication with the Opposition. In October, the Tánaiste confirmed to me, in his then role of Taoiseach, that he would engage formally with Opposition leaders and spokespersons on the response to war in Ukraine. I welcomed that, but we have not seen the sorts of regular briefings with Opposition leaders and spokespersons that we had during the Covid-19 pandemic, which were so useful and valuable in ensuring cross-party support and information channels. We have not seen the necessary level of engagement with the Opposition in the way that would be so important in ensuring that we can support the Government and all of those involved in the collective effort to provide accommodation and supports to various communities. There is a lack of a communication channel. In my constituency of Dublin Bay South, we have consistently called for a stronger and more coherent information channel. My three Labour Party councillors, Mary Freehill, Dermot Lacey, and Kevin Donoghue, and I all want to engage with the Government on this in our local area. We often find out about the provision of new accommodation on an  That brings me to the second point about co-ordination. This is something the Ukraine Civil Society Forum has consistently sought. We want to ensure there would be a person in government appointed as a central point of co-ordination. We know the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, under the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has taken the lead and done a significant amount. I pay tribute to all public servants, not just in that Department but across Departments – civil servants and public servants who have done immense work to ensure supports for those fleeing conflict. I also pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, whom we know was appointed in December. We welcomed that appointment. What we have seen since then, in particular with the letters from the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to other Departments, is a lack of support for the Department with responsibility for integration from other Departments, in particular the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which should be stepping up, because as we know accommodation is the single biggest crunch point. We should also see other Departments stepping up much more clearly. It is great to see such a strong presence from Ministers here today for this debate, but why have we not seen it more clearly at a national level until now? I raised this yesterday with the Taoiseach. Why do we not appoint a Minister of State with specific responsibility for housing refugees and international protection applicants? The Taoiseach suggested there were logistical difficulties with that. Let us see a reallocation of roles among Ministers of State to enable that to happen. We need a central-point person. Like other Opposition Members, I have been consistently calling for a channel of communication to which we can send suggestions for sites and premises in our constituency. We engaged with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage last April when he asked Opposition parties to suggest vacant housing sites which could be used to house those coming here from Ukraine and other countries on a temporary basis. We compiled a list of sites in conjunction with our local representatives on this but we do not get the necessary feedback, for example, on Baggot Street hospital and on Jurys Hotel in Ballsbridge. I have people coming to me in my constituency offering sites and suggestions and we need a central point to which that can be fed. On this issue too, it is not just about co-ordination, it is about capacity. I pay tribute to those in IPAS who are doing their very best in the face of this unprecedented challenge. We hear that IPAS appears to lack the capacity to take up offers that are being made to it for the provision of housing. We saw Daniel Murray's report in the  The third point I briefly want to make is about community supports. I very much welcome the community fund the Government has announced, but let us push at EU level for a cohesion fund. I raised this with Roberta Metsola when she spoke here in these Houses. We need community supports to be provided at EU level so that we can ensure that communities welcoming refugees and those seeking protection are themselves given the necessary supports and services to ensure everyone will get the accommodation and ancillary support they need. Finally, I wish to stress our history as a nation of emigrants, and my own personal history as a child of immigrants means that we all need to work together to emphasise the positive benefits of inward migration. We are crying out for skilled workers in so many sectors. We have skills shortages and labour shortages in hospitals, building sites and the hospitality sector. Let us increase and enhance the legal routes for migration here to ensure we can harness the skills of those who are here. Let us harness the skills of those who are already here and reduce the waiting time for people in the international protection system before they are allowed to legally work. Let us ensure we remove any unnecessary barriers to seeking work for all of the Ukrainians. Many of the Ukrainians whom I met have such enormous skills and talents. They must be facilitated and supported in every way to work and be helped to enrich our country and make us a better and more inclusive society.	spk_327
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-02-15	dail	33	Energy Costs and Windfall Taxes: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I am sharing time with Deputy Nash. I thank the Social Democrats for bringing forward the motion. We in the Labour Party are happy to support it in full. Today marks 12 and a half months since we introduced a Labour Party cost-of-living motion that proposed, among other things, the introduction of a windfall tax, so we have had similar debates previously. In the months since the debate on that motion was held, the price of energy has more than doubled, with an enormous negative impact on so many households. During that same period, however, we have seen record profits for oil and gas companies. Shell recorded a profit of $40 billion, its highest in 115 years, while BP’s profits doubled to $28 billion. In that time, we have missed a full year’s opportunity to recoup money from the profits of fossil fuel oligarchs and magnates. These are much-needed funds that could help to ease the burden of the cost of living for many families and households. In his opening remarks, the Minister conceded that the Government will introduce such a tax but there has been no indication of when that will be or, indeed, of any urgency about it. Will the Minister of State give us on clarity on this? It is essential. The energy bills crisis is an attack on people’s pockets on all fronts. Households’ domestic bills are rising, leaving less and less left over at the end of the month, along with businesses’ overheads. SMEs are finding it harder and harder to pay salaries and energy bills, putting jobs at risk. Throughout the country, we are already seeing closures. I am increasingly hearing from employers that are citing the rising cost of energy as an immediate threat to their business and to the livelihoods of their staff. Notwithstanding the untargeted cash injections in the form of the energy rebates from the Government, it seems adamantly passive in its role in this crisis. As I said, there is a tacit acceptance that a windfall tax will be introduced but no sense of urgency and no clarity as to when. The Government does not appear willing to press the EU on the timing of a windfall tax and is playing a game of wait and see when it comes to the Energy Charter Treaty. It will not even examine temporarily nationalising the Corrib gas field to control energy prices, as we in the Labour Party have suggested on a number of occasions. Crucially, it is running down the clock, and is unwilling to take action, on the enormous prices customers in district heating schemes are being charged, with costs for those people continuing to spiral month on month. In my view, district heating exemplifies the Government’s reluctance to face up to private interests, the disjointedness of Government climate and energy policy, and the real-life effects on ordinary households of the failure to act. I have heard from many people in my constituency living in apartment complexes who are paying increasingly high rates of bills, in some cases thousands of euros, for energy they are not even using. For one constituent of mine, her latest bill stood at €1,700 for two months for a family of four. She pays 56.3 cent per kilowatt hour, excluding VAT, yet the Bord Gáis residential rate is 13.13 cent per kilowatt hour, excluding VAT. Through no fault of their own, therefore, and despite cutting down on her energy use, she is overpaying for her family's energy use by a factor of four. I have made several representations about this issue, but the response has always been merely to reiterate that the regime is under review. One constituent wrote to the office of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in recent weeks to ask when she would see change. The response stated that technically it is her supplier who is the purchaser rather than her, giving rise to a commercial rate. We can imagine her reaction to that response. It simply did not pass muster with her, as it would not do with many others who are scrimping and saving to pay bills. If an apartment block's management company is unwilling or unable to renegotiate a contract, the residents are left with these extortionate bills. This is a clear example of Government failure. I urge the Minister of State to accept the motion.	spk_41

She has been undoubtedly a powerful force in Scottish politics throughout that time. I wish her well personally following that surprise announcement. The Taoiseach has acknowledged that people across the country are struggling despite the Government's measures introduced in the budget last year. We in the Labour Party predicted last October that there would need to be a mini-budget or a series of further measures implemented by the Government in the spring in order to deal with the cliff edge so many households face now as they see one-off measures come to an end. The Taoiseach has said he will meet with Ministers later this week and will make recommendations to the Cabinet on Tuesday. We are likely, therefore, to see in coming days a drip-feed of leaks emerge from the parliamentary party meetings of Government parties. We are likely to see kites flown and the Government testing the waters to see which proposals are politically expedient and which are not. I hope I am wrong in that prediction but I think it is very likely. However, it would be an insult to households across Ireland who are simply powerless at present. They are unable to plan for the future because they simply have no clarity or certainty from the Government on what will be included in what it is not calling a mini-budget but what will undoubtedly be some sort of cost-of-living package of measures. We are already hearing stories about what may be introduced by the Government but we need clarity. I will give the Taoiseach an example of a household in my constituency which simply cannot withstand this non-stop kite flying and needs urgently to see clarity from the Government. I raised this case earlier today during the debate on the windfall tax. My constituents, a family of two adults and two children, received a heating bill recently. Despite having been away for three weeks over the two-month billing period, their district heating bill for those two months alone stands at €1,700, a shocking figure. They cannot afford to wait weeks without knowing with any clarity what will come from the Government to assist them. Other constituents of mine, a single mother and her child who are housing assistance payment, HAP, tenants, have been forced to turn off their heat and hot water altogether because they cannot afford the extortionate bills. With seriously cold weather due to arrive at the end of this month and a ""beast from the east"" predicted, that mother, and so many others, cannot afford weeks of kite flying from the Government. We have heard from so many other constituents. One family cannot pay off their tracker mortgage, which is likely to have risen by over €450 per month with the new interest rate increases. They say they simply cannot afford to cut back on anything else. Right across the country people are struggling. What we need to see is clarity from the Government now as to when the mini-budget will be announced and what its measures will include. Will they be targeted, as Social Justice Ireland has called for, or will they be simply a series of more universal measures which are unlikely to make any real impact for the families I am talking about who are struggling and are in such a dire state of paralysis because they simply do not know how they will meet their spiralling bills?"	spk_65

This sounds like a mini-budget. If there is a finance Bill, it sounds very much like a mini-budget. I am glad that the Taoiseach has confirmed that there will be clarity on Tuesday. Will we have a Dáil debate next week? Are people likely to know next week what the nature of the measures will be, which ones will be targeted and which ones will be universal? It would be reasonable to give legislators in this Chamber some indication of a timeline for the introduction of these measures. I agree with the Taoiseach that speculation is unhelpful. There has been speculation on things like a 30% tax rate, for example. These kite-flying suggestions are simply not helpful in the context of struggling families and households. I want to finish by referring to the Mandate report that was launched today. I was glad to meet Mandate earlier and to hear directly from it about the stark examples and situation of so many of its members, 64% of whom earn below €451 per week. That is in a context where, in Dublin, average monthly rents are €2,324 per month. This figure illustrates the shortfall for so many people who simply cannot afford even to pay rents, let alone meet the other bills that are spiralling. I ask the Taoiseach to give us clarity on the timeline for next week now that we have established that next Tuesday will be critical.	spk_76

I acknowledge the presence at the funeral of not only the President but also a representative of the Taoiseach; the Minister, Deputy Foley; the Minister of State, Deputy Carroll MacNeill; and Deputy Devlin. I express on my behalf and that of the Labour Party our appreciation for that and we send our sincere thoughts, condolences and sympathies to Tom, Cliodhna, Macdara and all of Niamh’s friends and wider community. She has left a tremendous legacy and while we will have the opportunity to speak further on that at another date, I wanted to acknowledge it today. In the past 24 hours, my office has heard from several individuals who have languished on the housing list for years wondering when, if ever, they will have somewhere to call home. We have heard from a constituent facing an imminent and illegal eviction who cannot get a response from the Residential Tenancies Board, from an employee forced to commute six hours per day from Mayo to Dublin due to the lack of affordable housing here and from a homelessness case worker who is re-evaluating their career due to burnout.  The Government’s over-reliance on the private sector for the supply of housing is a strategy that is failing all those people who have contacted me and is failing people across the country. In six years, Dublin City Council has spent €220 million buying back former local authority homes, according to Sharon McGowan’s report for  Week in and week out, we hear the same narrative with different figures and new initiatives from the Government. The reality is that none of those initiatives have delivered for the people who have contacted my office or who are contacting all of us all the time.  This week’s Housing for All progress report makes for depressing reading because its promises and aspirations jar with the reality of those contacting my office, and jar with repeated calls from organisations like Focus Ireland and Threshold and from front-line workers. We have seen seven years of strong economic growth wasted, when we should have seen investment in housing provision. The problem has got worse. This evening the Dáil will debate a Labour Party motion to introduce real, substantial measures to deliver on housing, including an emergency public house-building programme, the extension of the eviction ban to the end of the year and the strengthening of the tenant 	spk_177

We appreciate that very much. We seek to be constructive in addressing the housing crisis and to put forward positive proposals for change that would deliver on housing.

We ask it to withdraw the amendment and work with us and all in opposition who seek to be constructive in this regard. I accept the €900 million in rent subsidies is essential to keep families and households out of homelessness but it illustrates the short-sightedness of Government housing policy over the past seven years that that level of financing is not seen instead in the provision of public housing on public land, which would be an investment for the State and have a longer-term impact on keeping families and individuals out of homelessness. Will the Minister address the fact that the number of people entering homelessness reached a record high of 11,632 in December? No matter what figures are given and what initiatives are announced, the housing policy is not working and we need to see innovative and constructive ways to address that. We seek to help the Government in doing that.	spk_179

Yet, while the planet burns, we are seeing oil magnates and corporates like BP and Shell just cashing in.

I thank the Minister of State for taking the motion, which notes that not enough homes are being built; that there are too many unused, vacant and derelict homes; and that over-reliance on the private sector to address the housing crisis has only worsened that crisis. Our motion also notes that Housing for All has failed as its targets are too low or non-existent and the Government is not meeting its targets specifically on social and affordable housing. Our motion further sets the context by recognising that a generation of young people are locked out of home ownership or secure and affordable tenancies. We have seen figures indicating that 92% of those aged 18 to 24 are concerned they will never be able to afford a home and half are considering emigration. It is in that context that we move our motion calling on the Government to introduce a series of emergency housing measures to address this crisis. We are moving this motion during a month when we are marking three years since the number of people in State emergency accommodation first reached what was seen as the critical figure of 10,000. Three years ago this month was the first time since the foundation of the State that figure was reached. That is a rather depressing anniversary, but we debate the motion against an even starker backdrop of figures. There was another record in December of 11,632 people recorded as homeless, which is well above the 10,000 mark that was in itself seen as appalling three years ago. Of those 11,632 people, 3,442 are children. That is in 2023 in what is a prosperous country, with effectively full employment, that has run budget surpluses, as we know. Of course, we also know that this figure, staggering as it is, does not capture those who are sleeping rough, those forced to couch surf, and all those in housing insecurity. I will speak shortly about the many individuals who contacted me through my constituency office who are in that sort of housing insecurity, without any assurance or expectation that they will be able to stay in their homes into the future. That is a very serious and dire situation for people to be in, especially those with children. Hidden among the figures are the 40% of employees under the age of 35 who are not listed as homeless anywhere and are not couch surfing but continue to live with their parents in a state of suspended childhood and dependency. This is a generation locked out of home ownership and secure and affordable tenancies. All of us have met those young, and some not-so-young, people and their parents. All of us are conscious that for them, their parents, and even parents who themselves are in secure homes, that this is an untenable situation. This is the big social issue of our times. It has huge knock-on consequences because our social protection and pension system for those in older age has always been predicated on a presumption that by retirement and pensionable age people will have reached a mortgage-free home ownership situation. Our entire social protection system is based on that premise, yet that is no longer the case for far too many people. A constituent of mine recently calculated that after 26 years of renting in Dublin, with no prospect of home ownership, they have paid more than €341,000 in rent, which is a staggering figure. That is money which is not going towards saving for retirement or paying for a home of their own. I am also hearing from pensioners in my constituency who are still renting well beyond the point where they thought they would be able to afford to buy, who are now unable to make their rent payments and are in that sort of housing insecurity I described. People in their 70s who have paid taxes and contributed for decades are contacting my office because they are facing eviction and cannot find anywhere else to live. This is unconscionable.  I will speak about children in particular. As I said, we have seen that 3,442 of those currently accessing emergency accommodation are children. No child should be in that situation of housing insecurity. No child should be faced with having to sleep rough or sleep on the streets. No child should be sent to a Garda station in the middle of the night for want of a place to go. No child should spend months on end with only a hotel room, shared with the rest of his or her family, to call home. Yet, I am hearing, as we all are, about children who are in those circumstances. I hear from so many people who are working with children in that situation, not just parents but teachers and those who are trying to pick up the pieces for those children. We passed a referendum to enshrine children's rights into the Constitution five years ago but it has to mean something to those most vulnerable children. In 2017, the Oireachtas voted in support of the Labour Party’s Housing (Homeless Families) Bill, which would create a statutory obligation to keep families out of homelessness. It progressed to the next Stage with support from Fianna Fáil but has been left to languish since then. We included some of that Bill's provisions within some of the constructive proposals we included in the motion. I will speak about the rental crisis and market failure. In anticipation of this debate, I looked at properties in my constituency, Dublin Bay South, on That was in a rent pressure zone. The market has failed. It cannot provide this fundamental human right, so we see people left queuing for hours for house viewings, living from paycheck to paycheck and unable to save for the future. I represent a constituency where 44% of properties are rented on the private market and so many people face insecurity and being given eviction notices. The primary cause of families entering homelessness is the landlord declaring an intent to sell the property, Focus Ireland tells us. During the pandemic we saw the impact an eviction ban can have in preventing people from entering homelessness. Because of that, we have called for a temporary extension of the ban through to the end of the year, not just for its own sake but also to give breathing space to the Government to bring forward policies and measures that will provide greater security to those who may well face eviction at the end of the ban. Avoiding a deluge of evictions means bringing in emergency measures of the sort we call for in our motion. I have heard from many landlords in my constituency too. Many of them are what we might describe as accidental landlords who own just one property that they bought to equate to a pension for themselves. They feel under threat and unfairly scapegoated, but this is not in any way about castigating or criticising individual landlords. It is about years and years of Government policy that has led us to an overreliance by the State on private landlords, many of whom are small landlords, in order to fill a gap in State provision of social and affordable housing. This is therefore not in any way about critiquing individual landlords; it is about critiquing State policy that has created that overreliance on the market. What are the constructive measures we propose? We want to see the tenant  It is not just renters I hear from about this scheme. Last night I received an email from a small landlord in an urban area who wants to sell up and leave the rental market. The landlord has two tenants on the housing assistance payment. The person wants those tenants to remain in that home and has sought that the local authority would buy the home in order to keep the tenants in that home. This landlord is utterly frustrated because the local authority simply refuses to buy under the scheme. The landlord has contacted the office of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and other local public representatives. The landlord says that they are trying to do what is right and do not want to make their tenants homeless but that everyone seems utterly powerless to make a decision. It is a real failure if the tenant  We call on the Government to do the right thing, to ramp up the tenant  Lastly, we are disappointed that the Government, instead of taking on board these constructive measures, has put forward a countermotion or amendment to our motion. We regret that and ask the Government to consider withdrawing its countermotion, take on our constructive proposals for change and ensure we can work together to address this utter scourge, this most pressing social issue of our time.	spk_310

Since the outset of the terrible war in Ukraine and the brutal invasion by Russia nearly a year ago, we in Labour, alongside groups like the Ukraine Civil Society Forum, have been calling consistently for a more co-ordinated approach by Government to the housing of refugees and people seeking international protection here. We have called especially for a single and clear co-ordinated point of contact and centralised systems for managing the State response to this crisis. Back in December, it appeared as though our calls had been heard and we anticipated real change would come, but not so, it seems. Despite the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O’Brien, who is doing his best alongside the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, and his Department, we are still seeing the locating of housing and provision of resources for those fleeing war and hardship being done  I agree with the Minister, Deputy O’Gorman, when he says ""no level of consultation"" would change the views of some on housing refugees in their areas. What is needed is a centralised approach from Government to getting information out to local communities in a timely way when new accommodation is being opened to enable the provision of support to new residents in their area. Such a system would facilitate and support the amazing welcome shown across so many communities across the country, in both rural and urban areas, for those who seek refuge here. It is undeniable there are sinister actors who are trying to further a far-right agenda in all this. A small number of people are seeking to exploit the information vacuum to sow fear and distrust in local communities. We have seen some awful reports of intimidation of families and children by protesters. This week we saw disruption of a Labour public meeting and our public representatives threatened for expressing solidarity with refugees, so this is a very scary time. Those who engage in racist attacks must be condemned outright by all of us, but the Government has a responsibility here too. So far, we are not seeing sufficient cross-departmental support for the efforts of the Department of the Minister, Deputy O’Gorman. We especially need to see more from the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government and more from the Tánaiste's Department of Defence in the form of the repurposing of barracks across the country. We are not even seeing sufficient resourcing for the international protection accommodation services, IPAS, to ensure it has capacity to provide accommodation. What will change? At the very least, will we see the allocation of additional resources to IPAS, perhaps the appointment of a special Minister in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and a coherent, NPHET-style cross-departmental response co-ordinated by the Taoiseach with a CMO figure to take responsibility and act as a point person on this? Will we see a public information campaign and allocation of resources to communities to ensure supports can be rolled out for those who come here seeking refuge and supports to the local communities who wish to offer the céad míle fáilte to them?"	spk_255

We in the Opposition who are seeking to show solidarity are often finding out about plans in communities after the far right does and we want to work with communities to show support. I engaged with protesters seeking information in my constituency but I did not have information to provide to them. We need to see a more co-ordinated response from Government, a centralised point of contact and clear evidence of the cross-departmental approach that will give the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth the support it clearly needs. The response I and others are getting to parliamentary questions is confirming the lack of support from other Government Departments for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.

Roberta Metsola, President of the European Parliament	dbsect_33	Ar son Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre cuirim fáilte mhór roimh an Uachtaráin Metsola go dtí Tithe an Oireachtais. President Metsola is welcome. As Ireland marks 50 years of membership of the European Union, we remember the economic and social progress we have made together but we also recall the hard lessons, particularly from during the economic crash, when serious mistakes were made by the EU and the European Central Bank, ECB, which we felt here. Thankfully, more recently the positive principles of solidarity and collective action have been central to the European response to the Covid-19 pandemic and Putin’s brutal war on Ukraine. What those crises have shown is the critical importance of the role of the state and the fact that over-reliance on the market will not solve the complex problems we face. Two immediate and pressing challenges that require a strong European response are the war in Ukraine and the climate catastrophe. First, since Russia's brutal invasion a year ago, we have seen nearly 5 million refugees flee Ukraine. Across the EU we have seen countries acting generously in response. Other wars in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere, combined with the impact of climate change, have led to more people seeking international protection, both here and in other European countries. What we need to see in response is a collective approach at European level to migration policy, one that recognises the benefits of inward migration to our Continent, supports countries in meeting their international obligations and shows what we call céad míle fáilte to those who come here seeking refuge. As we see today, the historic meeting of EU Commissioners in Kyiv is showing welcome solidarity and practical support for Ukraine in terms of accession to the EU, in its rebuilding effort and in seeking to win the war. At that level, I urge that, as part of that solidarity message, we see the introduction of an EU-wide cohesion and integration fund, ring-fenced for supporting countries and communities that are offering a welcome and supports to those fleeing war and persecution. Such a financial programme would have a positive benefit, recognising that people and communities need support for integration. Second, the climate crisis is an existential threat for all of us and we support President von der Leyen's strong leadership on a new green deal at EU level. However, we need to see more accelerated and urgent action. Debates over the proposed energy performance of buildings directive show we still have some way to go, with conservative groupings seeking less ambitious retrofit targets. We also need to see the EU do more to acknowledge the role of air transport in climate change. Like President Metsola's home country of Malta, we too are an island but we have to acknowledge that it is incomprehensible that aviation fuel is not taxed for its carbon emissions. We should see action on this at EU level. As the Labour Party is a member of the second largest grouping in the European Parliament, the Party of European Socialists, PES, we look forward to working le chéile san Eoraip with our sister parties to achieve a more equal Europe, our vision of a social democratic future for all the peoples of our European Continent.	spk_356

Last night, it was the removal of the DPMA from up to 12,000 vulnerable people in institutional care. Perhaps tomorrow we will see yet another story of a group of people being failed by the State. However, this is a much bigger story. The real story, as we see it, is the pervasiveness of what amounts to a callous legal strategy. In essence, the State approaches litigation against it in a manner indistinguishable from any faceless corporate entity. It is a war of attrition against those who dare to sue it. The route is well worn. People are denied legal rights unless they sue the State. If they do litigate, the cases are defended by the State and then, late in the day, prior to making discovery and certainly prior to going into trial, those with the resources and patience to keep going receive a settlement to avoid the setting of an adverse precedent that others could rely on in future. It happens everywhere. We have seen it in special educational needs cases, immigration cases and medico-legal cases against the State. It is also in the approach taken to those excluded from State redress schemes, such as those who have been subjected to sexual abuse in some schools, and to those affected by the Thalidomide scandal, on whose behalf I have been calling for a redress scheme for months. Again, this is a legacy issue that must be resolved by the Government. It is darkly ironic that we are debating this issue today in anticipation of the debate later this afternoon on the mother and baby homes scheme, a redress scheme that is certain to exclude large swathes of people who were victimised by church and State throughout the last century. The context changes, but the results stay the same. People who can endure the cost and stress of years of litigation will get their legal rights, but those who cannot afford that, will not. The Taoiseach has described this as a ""legitimate legal strategy"" but, rather than the vindication of rights, this is a ""cost-containment"" strategy, which takes priority for the Government. I have seen this in operation as a barrister where I acted for children from disadvantaged communities who were at severe risk of harm and who had been deprived of the care and support they needed. The only way to get the support they needed was to sue the State and show a readiness to go to trial. That is no way to treat vulnerable people who are being let down by the system. Those children who did not litigate did not receive any supports. The Judiciary was highly critical of that. This must be a watershed moment to see how we can ensure a change in Government policy. We ask the Taoiseach to call on Secretaries General of all Departments to come before the Committee of Public Accounts to attest to the legal strategy in place in each Department as regards litigation against the State. Is that initiative something the Taoiseach would support? Second, would he support a re-evaluation of the role of the Attorney General to ensure he or she must take into account the common good or public interest as well as the more narrow financial interests of the Government of the day?"	spk_67

The Government must of course, as a democratically elected government, reflect and respect the rights and wishes of the people and the common good. That is precisely why the Labour Party is calling for reform of the Office of the Attorney General. This is not only in order for the Government to review the State's litigation strategy to ensure that the State and the government of the day are acting in the common good across all the cases where people have been done injustice and where people deserve redress. We are also asking, in order to guard against future similar litigation strategies being adopted against similarly vulnerable groups of people, for a review of the role of the Attorney General. We are preparing a Bill that will not only ensure that the Attorney General's office will take regard of the common good and the public interest, as well as the narrow interest of government, but will also look at the publication of the advice of the Attorney General in specific cases. It is not always appropriate for the Attorney General's advice to remain confidential or for the person holding that position simply to act as if he or she is a lawyer advising a private client. The government of the day has a duty to reflect the wishes of the people and to act in the common good. The Taoiseach has acknowledged that and it is precisely the point I am making.	spk_76

All of these developments contravene the rights of the Palestinian people. I welcome the statement from the Tánaiste last week. While in Brussels for a meeting with EU foreign ministers, he called on Israeli authorities to pay compensation for the destruction of EU-funded buildings in occupied Palestine. That is a very important call. It is more than 18 months since the Dáil voted to condemn the de facto annexation of Palestinian land.

It is a deal which we believe is wrong on many levels. I have already voiced my grave concerns about it in this House, as have my colleagues, Deputies Kelly and Sherlock. It will fundamentally be an arrangement which will facilitate the handing over of millions of euro of public money into the wallets of private investors and vulture funds. We are gravely concerned about that. As we know, the deal has drawn immense criticism and outrage from across all sectors, urban and rural alike, from environmentalists, farmers and local communities. Many of our constituents in Dublin Bay South voiced serious disquiet to us, as the Minister will know. Even Deputies on Government benches have made clear their opposition to the partnership between Coillte and Gresham House. It begs the question of what is Government policy on forestry in Ireland. If there is concern on Government benches about this deal, as there appears to be, then will it be abandoned? Will there be a change in tack to address the crisis in the forestry sector? There is a bigger issue here too. The reality is that the forestry sector has been in crisis for many years. The crisis does not only affect those working in forestry but clearly has a significant impact on our ability to meet our vital climate targets because we cannot meet those targets unless every sector is working towards them. We cannot meet them without large-scale afforestation. The Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss was clear that State-owned woodlands should be recognised and managed as a strategic, long-term national asset for the common good. The State must take control of planting biodiverse forests and put an end to the expanse of clear-fell monoculture across the country. We all know, and I know the Minister knows, that Ireland's ancient native forests have been devastated by hundreds of years of unsustainable mismanagement. We must prevent further destruction by profit-hungry funds but we do not even have a working forestry programme. The Government is meeting just one quarter of its own afforestation targets. The licensing system is in disarray, with delays of two years for the approval of afforestation licences.	spk_224

In October last year, we in the Labour Party brought forward a motion which would have delivered pay parity for these vulnerable workers in the community and voluntary sector. We have seen no action from the Government since then, despite the fact the Government waved that motion through. The national executive of the Fórsa trade union is now backing a proposal for strike action in a number of community and voluntary sector agencies.

Clearly, we need to ensure staff and students from the LGBT community and minority backgrounds are protected in all schools and that employees are guaranteed equality in their workplaces. The Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, has estimated that thousands of its members are still forced to hide their sexuality due to fears of discrimination and that is despite the amendment to the Equality Act introduced on foot of Labour Party initiatives in 2015 which addressed some of the discrimination then possible in faith-based schools.

Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-01-24	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	"Last week, I put several questions to the Taoiseach about ethical standards in Fine Gael, and I have just been sitting here, as we all have, listening to the exchanges between Fine Gael and Sinn Féin over dodgy donations and funny money, we might say. I know we are going to return to the issue later. I want to raise with the Taoiseach an issue that is very serious because of the enormous real-life harm and consequences that have been inflicted on children and families as a result. I am speaking about the damning report of the Mental Health Commission, which has made unequivocal findings about the failings across the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS. They are appalling findings. One hundred and forty children have, apparently, been “lost” in the mid-west CAMHS system. There has been an abject failure to monitor children on anti-psychotic medication, chronic understaffing and long waiting lists. There have been two-year delays, we were told, for follow-up appointments, young people reaching 18 with no transition to adult services, and an appalling and endemic lack of organisation across the service. The findings are shocking and, behind the staggering figures and statistics, there are real children and families, some of whom will suffer lifelong consequences as a result of the failings detailed in the report. I am thinking about the 46 children in south Kerry CAMHS found to have suffered significant harm, as detailed in a report we saw last year, and of the 13-year-old girl written about by Kitty Holland in yesterday's newspaper, who was told, when she was engaging in self-cutting, that she was too high risk to receive help from the charity Jigsaw but not high risk enough to receive support from CAMHS. This was a child with a suicidal diagnosis, left in limbo. It is unthinkable that this is happening in today's Ireland, that children are being sold short in such a way. It is not just mental health services for children, because a record-breaking 46 children are reportedly waiting on trolleys in hospitals today. That is not how children should be cared for in a republic, with persistent failures of clinical oversight and delivery of services to children in need of mental and physical health services. The Taoiseach committed to setting up a unit on child poverty in his Department, as part of his nomination speech in December, but will he commit to ensuring children will receive the necessary health services that are clearly not currently available?Will the Government outline the parameters of the clinical review being conducted by the HSE into all open cases in each CAMHS team so we can see the true extent of failures for children? Will the Government ensure, as a priority, the immediate regulation of CAMHS under the Mental Health Act 2001? We need to see that legislation progressed. On ""Morning Ireland"" earlier, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, was somewhat evasive in his response to the question on legislation, yet we know that gaps in the Mental Health Act have left Ireland significantly out of line with international human rights standards regarding mental health services for children. There was a review ten years ago stating that we need to see all parts of existing legislation relating to children's mental health put into one stand-alone Bill. We need to see proper statutory regulation of this service."	spk_17
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-01-24	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I thank the Taoiseach for his response but it does not sound as if he and the Government are bringing the necessary urgency to this. I am conscious, as I think we all are, that Dr. Susan Finnerty found her findings so stark that she published them as an interim report. There is an urgent need for action to address that report. As I said, it is over ten years since an expert group recommended reform of the Mental Health Act to ensure all parts of existing legislation relating to children would be in a separate stand-alone section setting out child-specific guiding principles in line with international human rights standards. That is the sort of overall governance the Government needs to be leading on.The Taoiseach said the Government would give consideration to it but we need to hear more urgency from him about putting in place the necessary framework in order that the services can be delivered to the children who are being currently failed. I would like to hear from the Taoiseach what the parameters are for the HSE review into the open cases. The Taoiseach stated he does not have that available. I would like to hear about the timeline of the amendment of the Mental Health Act. Finally, can the Taoiseach accept the calls of organisations like Neurodiversity Ireland, which are seeking an urgent round-table discussion with stakeholders, parents groups and clinicians to address the devastating situation for children's mental health services?	spk_19

We think the State should take control of planting biodiverse forests and put an end to the expanse of clear-fell monoculture across the island of Ireland.

What has emerged in the past week about the conduct of not one, but two Fine Gael Ministers is deeply concerning. It raises fundamental questions about standards in public life, standards in public office, trust in politics, the rule of law and the integrity of our democracy. A Minister of State has already resigned without answering any questions and, further, the Minister responsible for ethics reform is now under investigation for undisclosed election donations. It is welcome that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will make a statement this afternoon in the Dáil and take questions, but it is regrettable that it appears there will be no facility for responses to our questions. The revelations are all the more concerning when a fringe minority is seeking to sow distrust and attack elected representatives to further a vicious far-right agenda. We all know the power of politics to transform the lives of people but, unfortunately, we know politics can have a dark side too. For many years, our political system was plagued with corruption and grubby deals. For decades, we in the Labour Party fought to stamp out corruption. We called out corruption in the planning system when it took place years ago. We sought to pass ethics laws. We ensured the passage of the right to freedom of information, protection for whistleblowers and a register for lobbyists. We ensured there would be limits on donations and on the power to purchase influence. However, on the necessary further ethics reform, unfortunately since 2016 this and the previous Government have sat on their hands. Both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have failed to move further with the necessary reforms. Deputy Brendan Howlin's Public Sector Standards Bill 2015, which would overhaul SIPO and give it the necessary extra powers it has long sought, was last debated in this Chamber exactly seven years ago, on 20 January 2016. It was then stalled and shelved by the Government in July 2020.When will the Taoiseach commit to introducing that Bill? Who will be responsible for taking it through the House? Will it be the Taoiseach? A Minister of State resigned last week when it was revealed that false information was submitted on a planning application. That cannot be the end of it. As leader of Fine Gael, can the Taoiseach say that this is behaviour his party tolerates? Does he What we know about the donation in 2016 to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is still limited. We still need to know more. It appears that a company and its owner picked up the costs of his election postering without his knowledge, which is a highly unusual arrangement to say the least. How can the Minister be clear that this was a donation to the party and not to the candidate to help his re-election? How can we trust what has been disclosed to date, in particular the commercial value Fine Gael has put on the donation? Where is the evidence the Taoiseach has to back up the revised disclosure? Can he tell us how the commercial value was determined? Is it common practice in Fine Gael for businesspeople to pick up postering costs for individual candidates?	spk_17

Indeed, his response has shed no clarity and perhaps obscured things further. The crucial point is that we cannot see any return to the bad old days, when politics in Ireland was plagued by corruption, grubby deals and cronyism. We cannot see that. We need to be sure that will not happen again. I repeat my question. In respect of the former Minister of State, Deputy English, is that behaviour, namely, the submission of false information on a planning application which resulted in a benefit to the individual, tolerated by the Taoiseach's party? I cannot put it any clearer than that. What action is the Taoiseach taking on that, as leader of Fine Gael?Did the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, receive a written acknowledgement, as required by SIPO guideline 1.3.4, confirming that this was a donation to the party and not to the candidate? What evidence is there that the employees were paid personally rather than through a corporate account to put up the posters? Is it acceptable to the Taoiseach that there was such a long delay between the Minister apparently becoming aware of this inadvertence or error in disclosure and the rectification of that error, which came only as recently as the past few days? Is that delay in rectifying the disclosure acceptable to the Taoiseach?	spk_30

In many cases, they have paid thousands of euro to remedy the defects and are in dire financial straits as a result. The Taoiseach said he is affected personally by this as well. Following the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, today, I would like to know whether the redress will amount to 100%. Will owners get back 100% of what they have already spent on remedying defects? We know many people have already spent thousands of euro. Therefore, we need a firm commitment that the scheme will be inclusive and will apply retrospectively to that full extent for those who have already taken the advice of the Government and have already begun or concluded repair works. It is vital that this scheme also marks a definitive end to the arm’s length approach to dodgy developers and builders. We need to hear from the Government its plans to tighten up the planning regulations so that those responsible for putting households at risk will not be put in a position where they can do so again, and so that owners' management companies will be reformed to give residents surety that the same builders will not be in charge of repair works.	spk_177
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-01-18	dail	33	Climate Action Plan 2023: Statements	dbsect_11	I am glad that we are here discussing the contents of the Climate Action Plan 2023, notwithstanding the delays in publishing the report and in holding this debate. I have stated previously, but it bears repeating, that the delay and missed targets are regrettably characteristic of the Government’s approach to the climate and biodiversity crises. The matter of climate action is so serious, we should have been scheduled for the Dáil and Seanad to debate this updated plan before Christmas and it is somewhat late coming to the House today, in January. Nevertheless, I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute on behalf of the Labour Party to the debate, and I do so in the spirit of working constructively to overcome the immense challenges we face in meeting our necessary climate emission reductions targets. This answer to our collective problem is inherently political, but it should not be partisan. Ireland must lose its reputation as a climate laggard and we must all work together to achieve a better status for us. We are well into the key decade in which we must see our emissions reduced by half. We are already on the precipice of reaching that worrying milestone of 1.5°C global warming. We are mid-way through the first carbon budget, which requires emissions to fall by an average of 4.8% per year, and yet the Environmental Protection Agency has reported that Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions rose by almost 5% in 2021, during a pandemic year. At this rate, we are seriously diminishing the chance of meeting our climate targets. I have to ask if the Minister believes that there will be further slippage in the achievement of these targets. I listened carefully to the Minister's speech. Indeed, there were some welcome announcements today on the roll-out of rapid electric vehicle, EV, charging points. The Minister's points about circular economy are vitally important and I support those. There is much in the climate action plan that is important and significant and yet it is heavy on aspiration but light on delivery. In the section on district heating, for example, all are agreed on the considerable potential of district heating schemes to curb emissions but there has been such a severe lack of delivery and such a severe delay in rolling out schemes, such as in Poolbeg. I visited the Covanta plant some time ago and saw the mechanisms there for achieving district heating systems, and yet no resourcing is put in place to ensure that they would, in fact, be delivered. That is the real problem. To echo the sentiments of Friends of the Earth and other environmentalists, the real test for the Minister and indeed for the Government is to deliver not only ambitions but also outcomes. We need to see serious priority placed on outcomes on climate action, not just by Ministers and Departments, but also by State agencies they oversee. I have raised in this Chamber previously reports in the media, in particular in the  We in Labour have repeatedly called for the Department of the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach to take a stronger role in keeping climate action plans on track across Departments and across State agencies. In housing, for example, the Minister has said that Government has met its targets on retrofitting of housing. Let us face it. There is a significant building and deep retrofitting programme in place, with 120,000 dwellings to be retrofitted to BER B2 by 2025 and a goal of 500,000 by 2030. According to the Department’s own reports, construction of public housing slowed between the third quarter of 2021 and the same period last year. Anyone attempting to renovate a home now will know of the effect of inflation on the cost of building supplies. They will know of the difficulties in securing labour. It does not seem that it will be feasible to meet those ambitious retrofitting targets. Does the Minister believe that his Department is sufficiently resourced to ensure retrofitting targets are met and a greater co-ordination between Departments would be vital to see these targets achieved? I will speak finally on the topic of forestry. Too often, the issue of biodiversity and the biodiversity crisis is overlooked in conversations about climate change. In that context and in the context in which we know that forests serve such a vital function as a carbon sink, I want to raise with the Minister the worrying proposal to sell-off land by Coillte. This is a proposal that has raised immense concerns. I have heard numerous people - constituents of mine and people across the country - who are really concerned about this. We in Labour are unequivocal about this. Coillte must adopt a new approach. They must plant more publicly-owned forests and partner with farmers to support farmers in developing new forestry on their own lands to provide a long term sustainable income, as the Minister suggested in his speech, and to help Ireland meet our climate targets. The proposed fund appears not to make any sense in the context of our overall objectives. Indeed, it has united environmentalists and farmers, and all sectors of society, against it. It seems that, under the reported proposal, Coillte will source the land for forestry, carry out the planting and management, but private investment will benefit from State grants and premia. We will see more monoculture forests, driven by a profit motivation. We cannot see how this will either boost biodiversity or support our agriculture sector to meet ambitious targets. Indeed, we think it is wrong for private investors to reap all of the financial benefits. Why is Coillte itself not simply managing these proposed forests and why is the Government not supporting Coillte to do this so that it is done in public ownership? I would like to hear some clarity from the Minister on that. I am aware this was raised earlier and the Taoiseach stated that this was not directly a matter for the Government. I simply do not accept that. The Government must intervene here to ensure that Coillte can be supported in this way. We want to see farmers provided with a new long-term source of income so that we can commit to a sustainable and biodiverse farming sector and a sustainable and biodiverse forestry sector. This is something that requires a urgent response from the Government.	spk_200
Ivana Bacik	55	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2023-01-18	dail	33	Oil Emergency Contingency and Transfer of Renewable Transport Fuels Functions Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_12	"I am glad to take this opportunity to discuss the Bill to strengthen the State's ability to manage stocks in the event of a curtailment of oil supplies. I listened to the Minister’s assurances that no such shortage is imminent. Indeed, I agree it is important that debates in the House on energy security do not give rise to any sense of panic but it is inevitable that at some stage fossil fuels will no longer be available to us to further exploit. It is also clearly in the context of the brutal invasion of Ukraine by Russia that we are having the debate. That has made us all acutely aware about the risks to our energy security and fuel security. It is both in the context of the climate catastrophe and in the context of that brutal war that we are having this debate. With that in mind, I look forward to further engaging with the Minister on the Bill and on other measures to make more durable the various sectors of everyday life that are most vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply of fossil fuels and energy insecurity. The Bill offers some welcome clarity around the powers of the Minister, and how quickly they can be deployed to control the supply and distribution of fuel in an emergency. The Bill will also put all aspects of oil emergency planning on a statutory footing and will establish a register of oil suppliers to ensure fast communication to retailers, which is positive. We are all conscious that, as part of our EU and International Energy Agency obligations, NORA should maintain approximately 85 days of strategic stocks. That stock holding is expected to be at 90 days, I understand, by the end of this month. Without adequate contingency plans, that is not a long enough time. It is all well and good to protect and preserve fossil fuels for emergency use. Of course, our priority must be reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, but also in the interim insulating people from market-driven volatility on international wholesale energy markets. In that regard, we in Labour have previously raised with the Minister the prospect of the Government engaging in a temporary nationalisation of the Corrib Gas Field. I renew my call on him and his Government colleagues to give that serious consideration. It does not require any additional legislation. It is a matter that does not need to be dealt with within this legislation because legislation is in place from the 1970s giving Government that power. We believe that temporary nationalisation of the Corrib field should form part of any contingency plan to mitigate supply line disruptions. It would mitigate supply line disruptions by providing a healthy supply, a guarantee of supply and, crucially, allowing for price control. I have spoken previously about the anomaly that gas produced locally in the Corrib gas field is still subject to price determination by reference to international markets. As a result, we see the owners of the field gaining what one might describe as ""windfall profits"" because, for them, the cost of production has not increased. It has not been affected directly by the war in Ukraine, yet they are benefiting from the international setting of prices in this way. Of course, we appreciate that the best contingency plan to mitigate supply lines of imported fuel being interrupted is to develop our own indigenous clean energy sources and we believe that much more should be done by Government on that. This Bill, and the context of a war, should not be allowed to distract from the much more pressing need to realise our potential as a world leader in clean energy production. We need in Ireland to rapidly accelerate our efforts towards deployment of onshore wind, offshore wind and solar capacity. The Government has ambitions to do that but we need to see delivery of that. We need to see serious investment in energy efficiency and in the development of renewable capacity. We need to see an expanding interconnection with European energy suppliers and deepening internal market integration. We need to break the hold of the fossil fuel oligarchs and magnates to make Ireland the renewable superpower that the Minister thinks we can, and we all want to, be but we need to see a greater sense of urgency in the delivery of that objective. Of course, one of the most versatile ways to avoid chaos in the transport sector in the event of an oil crisis is to make more accessible the options of walking, cycling and travelling in electric vehicles or vehicles powered by green hydrogen. We discussed this to some extent earlier in the debate on the climate action plan. We are all conscious of the embeddedness of oil and other fossil fuels within transport. The Minister pointed out that transport was one of the most difficult sectors in which to achieve reductions in emissions. We know how heavily dependent Ireland is on imported fossil fuels for transport, as well as for energy generation and for heating. They comprise 80% of fossil fuels at present. That is a chilling context within which we have this debate. Part of the plan to create durable systems to withstand inevitable difficulties with oil supply must involve that key transition to modes of transport not vulnerable to shortages. I welcomed the report this morning of the new EV charging measures to remove or at least reduce so-called ""range anxiety"" to encourage more people to make the shift from fossil fuel vehicles to electric vehicles. I was glad in that context to read in the climate action plan what was set out as part of the avoid, shift, improve framework. Welcome measures include the setting of a target of a 50% increase in daily active travel journeys and a 130% increase in daily public transport journeys. The improved targets that set percentage shares for low-fossil public and private vehicles, including the goal that 100% of new car registrations should be EVs, are also welcome. We have seen impressive increases in the take-up of EVs but we are still not coming close to the targets set by Government.Delivery is key on this issue. At local level, every week in my constituency, which is also the Minister's, I hear from constituents who want to make the move to electric vehicles but who do not have a driveway or any accessible charging point they can use to ensure they would be able to use an EV. I reiterate my call for better provision of EV charging, not only on motorway networks as the Minister outlined earlier but also for charging on streets where houses do not have driveways or where there are apartment blocks. At present these people do not have access to any public or private charging point. The lack of such charging points is preventing people from making the necessary move to EVs. It would be positive to see greater movement on it this year. I have engaged closely with Dublin City Council on this and I am constantly told that new strategies are being rolled out. Again, we are just not seeing delivery. In the Portobello area, there is one public charging point and it is always in use. This is the area where I live. No house has a driveway. Many people in this area who need cars want to make a move to electric vehicles. They are prevented, or at least discouraged, from doing so because of the lack of charging facilities. There are lofty public transport goals in the climate action plan, including progress on continuing the programmes of work; advancing BusConnects in five cities; MetroLink; DART+; the Cork area commuter rail programme; PSO electric bus fleet procurement, including depot charging upgrades; and investment in passenger freight rail. These are flagship infrastructure projects. The Labour Party is glad progress is being made on these. We emphasise the potential for climate action and the transport revolution to raise standards of living in Ireland by creating new well-paid unionised jobs in these sectors, thus providing for the all-important just transition we speak about as a party of the left and the party of the trade union movement. We reiterate our call for a widening of access to public transport and the introduction of a €9 climate ticket to incentivise greater use of public transport in towns and cities in all our communities. We believe this initiative should have been undertaken by the Government in the budget to encourage greater usage of public transport and to address the cost-of-living crisis by reducing public transport fares and transport costs from many families and households. Other smaller changes are required to support all of those who wish to make the shift to public transport. In our constituency, Labour Party Councillors, Dermot Lacey, Kevin Donoghue and, in particular, Mary Freehill, have been working on small but significant ways to make public transport more accessible. Councillor Mary Freehill has done work with the age-friendly working group in the Kimmage and Rathmines area, for example, seeking to make bus stops more accessible. Many bus stops in Dublin lack seating. It may sound like a small thing but when I raise this at meetings with local residents I find it is something that older people in the community in particular find a real hindrance to using buses. There is a simple bus pole and often there is no shelter or no seating. This can be a disincentive for people who want to use public transport but, as they have mobility issues, are put off by the prospect of having to stand for long periods at a bus stop. For those who find it difficult to avail of such facilities for reason of age or disability, it is a disincentive to using buses. Councillor Freehill, having investigated the matter, learned the primary obstacle to the NTA installing seating at bus stops, which was the simple request she made, is a refusal by users of the advertising panels at bus stops to cede space. The company that runs the advertising believes that putting in seating, even where there are panels and the facility to do so, would diminish the scope for advertising. In addition to electronic advertisements being a problematic addition to the public landscape, the fact they would take precedence over access for ordinary citizens shows the need for a readjustment of priorities. I appeal to the Minister to address this point. As a cyclist it would be remiss of me to omit from my contribution the awesome power of cycling as a tool in the fight against energy insecurity and climate change. I am glad some promising bicycle infrastructure programmes are starting to come onstream. It is promising, for example, to see Dublin City Council rolling out such an extensive network of cycle lanes across the city. That is welcome and long overdue. We in the Labour Party have long called for the extension of the cycle to work tax scheme to allow parents to purchase bikes for their children. We call it a bike to school scheme. We have costed it at €1.4 million. We believe it would have a significant impact in encouraging the uptake of cycling among children and younger people. The problem is the current tax scheme does not support those out of work or those who are self-employed to purchase a bike nor does it offer supports for parents to buy bikes for their children. We would allocate additional funding through the social welfare allowance additional needs payment to provide grants of up to €250 to support those who want to buy a bike but who are not covered by the cycle to work scheme at present. Alongside this we are calling for the Government to carry out a comprehensive review of how the tax system could be better used to incentivise the uptake of cycling, e-bikes and cargo bikes by homes and businesses. The cycle to work scheme has been a huge success but it is about how we can expand the take-up. This is the question. I hope the Minister will take these suggestions on board in the spirit of constructive engagement. As we are discussing the volatility of the energy market and the effects of external factors, in particular, the war in Ukraine, I want to express my sympathy to those killed this morning in the attack near Kyiv. It is another appalling loss of life. We have seen so much loss of life since Vladimir Putin commenced his brutal invasion, which is an affront to our values of democracy, justice and respect for life. While it is our friends in Ukraine and neighbouring countries who are suffering the worst consequences of Putin's awful invasion, it is also a reminder of how vulnerable our way of life is to the whims of despots and warmongers. When we debate Bills such as this it bears repeating why we are debating them and what the context is. Climate change and conflict around the world are strongly interlinked. The protection of our fuel systems and the protection of fuel and energy security in Ireland is closely related to the protection of our peace and democratic values. None of this should be taken for granted. Part of our resistance to dictators such as Putin must involve showing that we are serious about building our resilience so that not only Ireland but all European countries and all democratic countries will not be held to ransom by those who seek to meddle or interfere with our energy supply, or to interfere at a much more substantial level with our country and our way of life, as we have seen in Ukraine. I look forward to further engaging with the Minister and the Department on the Bill. I reiterate that the context in which we are debating the Bill is one that none of us could have envisaged a year ago. We all thought it would not happen and now we are 11 months into a brutal war. Of course it is raising all of these questions about fuel security and, more fundamentally, about the security of all of our countries and peace in Europe. It is in this serious and depressing context that we debate the legislation. The Labour Party will support it because we recognise the need for it. Without wanting to raise any panic it is important that contingencies should be made. We appeal to the Minister to consider other contingencies, such as the nationalisation of Corrib and, of course, the important climate action plan measures on transport and so many other ways in which we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels."	spk_247
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-12-17	dail	33	Taoiseach a Ainmniú - Nomination of Taoiseach	dbsect_3	"I begin by extending a personal tribute to Deputy Micheál Martin on his public service and thanking him for the courtesy he has extended to me since I became a Deputy. I appreciate it. We all acknowledge that he took office at an unprecedented time of challenge, during the Covid-19 pandemic. Since then, we have faced the additional enormous challenge of the fallout from Russia's brutal war on Ukraine and we are also facing this existential climate catastrophe which must be acknowledged. It must also be acknowledged that very few people get to choose of their own free will their time of stepping down as Taoiseach. For that alone, today is unique. However, we in the Labour Party cannot support the Fine Gael nomination at this changeover time. We do not believe that this so-called changeover represents anything but a cosmetic change at a time when we need a real and substantial change in the policies and solutions proposed by the Government. We in the Labour Party know, as people across the country know, that this Government is not delivering an Ireland that works for all - an Ireland of equality. In 1919, more than 100 years ago, one of our party's founders, Thomas Johnson, wrote in the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil, ""It shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing, or shelter"". Important words, yet nearly 250,000 children today live in deprivation, with 3,480 children homeless and, a week from Christmas, far too many parents will struggle to heat homes this winter, put food on the table for their children or ensure that Santa will bring a gift. A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, we have come through a once-in-a-century pandemic. We have seen the capacity of the State to pivot and deliver public services and radical change urgently. This Government, however, has failed to seize the opportunity to refashion housing provision, social infrastructure and the health service at a time of strong budget surpluses. The opportunity to transform our country and society has been squandered. Now is when we need a radical vision to bring about a real change in policy. A brutal war is being waged on our Continent, with tens of thousands killed in Ukraine and millions of refugees fleeing Russian aggression. A return of inflation is ravaging incomes and it is hitting those on low wages, pensions and social welfare the hardest. There are ominous signs of a slowdown, with job losses in the tech sector, while the stalling of construction projects is slowing down the building and delivery of new homes. Record heatwaves across Europe this summer are a sharp reminder of stalled progress and untenable delays on bringing about renewable energy and the action necessary to meet our ambitious climate targets. In 2020, we were told the programme for Government would invest in climate action and deliver a new energy system but, once again, a climate action plan for next year is delayed and there is no sign of the necessary reductions in emissions that need to be delivered now and next year. When the outgoing Taoiseach was nominated two and a half years ago, we were told the test of the Government would be one of delivery. That is the right test but, on all the key measures of delivery and success, this Government has failed. Homelessness is up. Healthcare waiting lists are up and carbon emissions are up. Too many children have inadequate homes. Too many children with autism lack appropriate school places, or any school places. Too many parents are unable to find an affordable home or a suitable childcare or early years place, with no sign of promised reductions in crèche fees and crèches closing. Too many workers remain on low and insecure pay or stuck in traffic jams without decent public transport options. As we face into winter, too many older people remain deeply anxious about heating their homes or getting the care they need. Ireland remains far too dependent on fossil fuels, with surging use of energy in data centres and the failure to build the offshore wind generation capacity that we have been promised for so long and which is so sorely needed. The failure of delivery on so many fronts should have refashioned the agenda and policies of the Government. Instead, what we are seeing with today's cosmetic changeover is a programme for Government that is unchanged, with no new ambitions and the same complacency. At the midway point of this coalition, why is there no substantive revision in policy? Why are we seeing a programme for Government that remains out of step with the changed world? Why are the same Ministers being retained in Departments where they are simply not delivering the necessary change?Perhaps the new Taoiseach will surprise us later today with more dramatic changes than expected. However, unless the policies of the Government and the programme for Government are revised, there will be no change in the delivery and lack of delivery. The Government has been plagued by resignations, instability and ethical concerns. We know, or we can predict at this stage, that the Tánaiste will return to the office of Taoiseach. On a personal level, I wish him very well. However, his party has spent too long in government and has run out of ideas. In the seven years Fine Gael has been in government since the 2016 general election, it has singularly failed to resolve the housing crisis. Indeed, it has made it worse, with an ideological insistence on an over-reliance on the private sector to deliver homes. It is a delivery that is simply not happening. We have seen a catalogue of unforced errors by Ministers, while talented backbenchers apparently remain blocked from taking high office.  The erosion of standards in public office has accelerated in more recent years under the Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil Government. A  When the Dáil last gathered to elect a Taoiseach, I was not a Member. The only electoral contest since the coalition was formed delivered a clear rebuke to the Punch and Judy politics of Fine Gael versus Sinn Féin. The Dublin Bay South by-election result in July 2021 showed the public desire for a more constructive, positive and left-wing alternative to the  Throughout the course of this Dáil, the Labour Party has put forward constructive, social democratic and socialist alternative policies. We have worked to deliver change from the Opposition and we will continue to outline our vision of an Ireland that works for all. On workers' rights, we proposed legislation on sick pay, a living wage, a real right to flexible working and pay rises for workers. On housing, our renters' rights Bill would have limited the grounds for eviction and would have frozen rents. Our Bill to implement the Kenny report would end land speculation and hoarding. On care, we have championed student nurses, community and care workers and a public universal childcare scheme. On climate, we have argued for radical measures, including a €9 a month climate ticket and genuinely ambitious State action on emissions. More generally on reform, we have argued for a ban on gambling advertising, reform of our citizenship rules, rights for co-habiting couples and a national autism strategy. On the economy, our fully costed budgets and cost-of-living measures would have put this country on a pathway to delivering real equality. That is the sort of Ireland the Labour Party wants to see - an Ireland that works for all. That is why, in the next election, we will offer a clear vision and alternative to both narrow nationalism and right-wing orthodoxy and ideology. We will offer a social democratic, socialist alternative to the Punch and Judy show. It is a show that may grab headlines but it will not deliver change. I have always believed that social and economic rights and social and economic equality are two sides of the same coin. That is why I joined the Labour Party. Campaigning for economic justice and standing up for those struggling to make ends meet are core to the vision and values of our party. Today, as we see the failure of the market-knows-all polices of the Government, we know the Labour Party values of equality, solidarity and fairness are needed more than ever. That is why we will not be supporting the Fine Gael nomination for Taoiseach and why we believe that, instead of cosmetic change, we need to see real and substantial change in Ireland."	spk_24
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-12-17	dail	33	Appointment of Taoiseach and Nomination of Members of Government	dbsect_9	I want to start by offering my personal good wishes to those who have been appointed or reappointed today to Cabinet, and of course to the incoming Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar. However, on behalf of the Labour Party, I want to say that we cannot support this Cabinet, because it is not in truth a new Cabinet and there are no new ideas.There is no change in the policies being offered by this Government. I am personally disappointed that there is no change in the gender balance of the Cabinet. We need more women in Cabinet, especially in a year when there will be a gender equality referendum, as we on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality have sought. Above all else, we need real change and new vision in policies. Instead, what we heard from the incoming Taoiseach and, indeed, the new Tánaiste, Deputy Micheál Martin, and the Minister for Environment, Climate, Communications and Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was an acknowledgement that the Government has failed to deliver. It has failed to deliver on housing, climate and addressing the challenge and scourge of child poverty. What we have seen from the Government through the first half of its term has been no shortage of ambitions, plans and targets, but a chronic lack of delivering outcomes. Halfway through the lifetime of this Government, this coalition of convenience, what we are seeing is a Government that appears content with serving up only half measures - on housing, climate, care and work. With today's purely cosmetic changes in Cabinet at half time, we do not see any improvement. Like the World Cup final, whether it is Argentina or France that wins tomorrow, we know the reality is there will be no change in conditions for women, LGBT people or workers in Qatar, just as there is no change in the policies being offered by this Government whether it is Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael that holds the position of rotating Taoiseach. We will continue to see missed targets on housing and climate action and, shamefully, we will continue to see far too many children continuing to live in poverty or to be homeless, and this despite budget surpluses. The Taoiseach's commitment to a new unit for child poverty will be meaningless unless there are adequate resources deployed and the sort of mobilisation of State capacity we saw during Covid to tackle the scourge of poverty among children and the scourge of homelessness. We need more State action and urgent intervention to address the real and glaring problems with the childcare and early years education system. We need delivery of the promised reduction in fees for parents and a genuinely universal and publicly funded childcare system. We need the roll-out of free general practitioner, GP, care from the Department of Health, particularly for children, and we need the scandal of children with disabilities waiting long months and years for assessments to be given the attention it deserves. On climate, despite the fine rhetoric of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, what we see is a pattern of missed targets and delays, most recently in the publication of the climate action plan. It is still promised for next week but that will be after the Dáil has risen and we will no longer have the opportunity to hold the Minister to account on Ireland's missed targets on emissions. Across all Departments, what we need put in place are political structures to enable the repurposing of many large vacant buildings across the State to accommodate those fleeing war in Ukraine and elsewhere, rather than simply leaving this challenge to be addressed by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman. I hope the Taoiseach will continue the positive work of the shared island unit. The restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the resolution of the protocol will continue to be key priorities for all of us across the House as we mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. I know all parties will work together in that regard. On the Government side, however, we are not seeing sufficient new vision and change to address the serious crises in and failures to deliver on housing, care, climate and work that have characterised the first half of the Government's term in office. It seems that will continue to characterise Government responses to these crises through the next half of its term. Beyond the cosmetic change offered by this so-called halftime Government reshuffle, we need the sort of radical and substantial vision for change that was embodied in Tom Johnson's words more than 100 years ago when he outlined the Labour programme for an equal Republic, a Republic in which children would have an equal early years start, all children would be able to achieve their full potential, everyone would get a home and the level of care they need, and the State would step up and deliver the supports that are necessary in that social democratic and socialist vision for change, a vision that we in the Labour Party will continue to offer. My colleague, Deputy Nash, will take our remaining time.	spk_94

I also extend my deepest condolences to the family of Private Shane Kearney who we hear has been injured and to the others injured and, indeed, to the families of all those who are serving abroad in Lebanon and on other UN missions for Ireland at this time. We are all conscious of the immense courage of our Defence Forces personnel and the immense sacrifice both they and their families give in being away from home for so long. It must be especially hard at this time, with this shocking news, for the families of all Defence Forces personnel serving overseas and, indeed, for all of those who are abroad on peacekeeping missions. The Defence Forces have a proud, well-deserved reputation and record as peacekeepers in Lebanon and elsewhere. We have a very strong international reputation as peacekeepers and, yet, this horrific news reminds us of the serious and immense danger faced every day by our peacekeepers abroad. It also reminds us of the 47 other Defence Forces personnel who have been killed while serving overseas. We are all thinking of them and their families at this time. On behalf of the Labour Party, I extend my deep condolences, sympathies and thoughts to the families of all those affected and I hope and wish for a recovery for those who have been injured in this horrific attack.	spk_168
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-12-15	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_30	I am conscious, as I think we all are, that this is the Tánaiste's last Leaders' Questions in his current role. I want to bring to his attention the publication just this morning of the final report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality, which I had the honour of chairing. Our report is entitled Unfinished Democracy: Achieving Gender Equality. What we have set out to do in this report is devise an action plan for the implementation of the 45 recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality, which amount to a blueprint for achieving a truly gender-equal Ireland. At the launch this morning, we saw the audiovisual room packed with stakeholders, civil society groups, academics and many of those who engaged with us and indeed many members of the citizen's assembly. I expressed our thanks as a committee to the assembly, to Dr. Catherine Day who chaired the assembly and to all the stakeholders who engaged with us.What we heard from those present was a real desire to see the report implemented, to see the actions we recommended taken up by the Government and progressed over the coming term. There are some clear measures there that need to be acted upon urgently. I am seeking from the Tánaiste and his Government a commitment on recommendations 1 to 3 of the citizens' assembly. Those recommendations relate to constitutional change, both to the equality guarantee in Article 40.1 of the Constitution, to make it more inclusive and refer specifically to gender equality, and crucial changes to Article 41 of the Constitution, that is, the family article. The citizens' assembly asked us to do three things with Article 41, namely, take out the gendered language that currently refers to women and mothers as having lives and duties within the home; create a more inclusive definition and protection for care within the Constitution; and extend the definition of family beyond the current narrow definition based on marriage. In our work, hearings and deliberations, the committee devised a single set of wording to be put to the people by way of referendum that would achieve the desires of the Citizens' Assembly and create a more inclusive and more equal document. It is probably the first time an Oireachtas committee has devised wording for the Constitution. We were able to do so through the extensive consultation and engagement we have had, particularly with the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and other Ministers, including the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, on the idea of a constitutional referendum. We are all very conscious that there has been a number of false starts on this referendum. There have been previous attempts to delete the gendered or sexist language from the text but they have come to nothing because there has not been a cross-party or cross-civil society consensus on this. We have come a long way towards achieving that. Will the Government commit to holding a referendum on those three recommendations in 2023, as all members of our committee have asked?	spk_188
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-12-15	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_30	I thank the Tánaiste for his undertaking to give a structured response. That is very welcome. I again thank my colleagues on the committee who engaged so constructively and intensively in the work we carried out. There was an immense range of issues that we had to cover in a short timeframe. We had a superb secretariat working with us on that and I thank them as well. I am also conscious that we will have the opportunity to debate the report in both the Dáil and the Seanad in the new year. I reiterate that we have done a very signifiacant amount of work to achieve a singular set of wording that could be put to the people by way of referendum and that we believe has moved us on in respect of that pathway to holding a referendum on this. I understand the Government will want to ensure there is a clear consensual basis for moving forward with that referendum but I think our engagement has provided a good pathway on that. We also produced an interim report on this in July. We engaged with stakeholders since that report was published and that is what has led us to this clear recommendation for constitutional change. I again urge the Tánaiste to take up that challenge and ensure that referendum is held within the next 12 months.	spk_190

One of the key recommendations is to have a constitutional referendum to expand the definition of family beyond the marital family. I wish to raise a specific issue around treatment of cohabitants that could be addressed by Government through legislation. Some time ago my colleague, Deputy Kelly, raised the awful situation of Johnny O’Meara who last year tragically lost his partner of 20 years and the mother of his children, Michelle Batey, who died of breast cancer. Upon her death John became starkly aware of the abject lack of supports for him and his children simply because he and Michelle had never married. Within the Seanad Senator Wall has been pioneering our labour legislation, the Social Welfare (Surviving Cohabitant’s Pension) Bill, which would ensure that the surviving partner of a cohabiting couple would be entitled to a widow or widower’s pension. Will the Government commit to bridging the legislative gap in inequality to ensure protection for cohabitants in these situations, pending the holding of a referendum to recognise a more inclusive definition of family?	spk_202

This is a serious issue for many homeowners, families and households. Like other colleagues, I have met many residents of affected apartment blocks, as well as with the Construction Defects Alliance and others. In July, I raised this issue in the Dáil with the Tánaiste and sought a commitment from Government for an adequate and effective redress scheme for those affected, and I was glad there was a positive response to that at the time. The Minister set out the steps he is taking and those he proposes to take. He said he received the final report of the interdepartmental and agency group yesterday, which looks at the recommendations in the working group report. He also said he would bring a memo to Cabinet next week on that. It is somewhat unfortunate we are debating this in a vacuum because we have not yet seen either the interdepartmental group report or the memo being brought to the Cabinet, nor will we have an opportunity to debate the report until the new year. Will the Minister of State bring back the call we would all make, cross-party, to have an early debate on this issue again in the new year, when we will have sight of the interdepartmental group findings and the memo to the Cabinet? We would then be clearer as to exactly what the Government proposes to do for those who are seriously affected. This cuts across many different constituencies and affects throughout the county. In my constituency of Dublin Bay South, I have met apartment owners and residents from Rathmines, Ballsbridge and across the constituency who are affected by defective construction in their buildings and homes. Many are already out of pocket because they have expended money on remediation works, either personally or through fees to their owner management companies, and we should not forget that many more who have not spent that money yet are living in danger. A home should be a safe place. Housing is a human right. Last week I stood alongside many colleagues outside these Houses with people whose homes are not safe because of defective building. It is five years since the Grenfell Tower fire tragedy in London, which showed us so starkly the carnage that can result because of defective building practices. I note an Irish company was involved with the supply of cladding that was involved in that tragedy. Tragedies such as these are always at the back of our minds when debating construction defects and defective buildings because they can have such real and tragic consequences. All those living in defective homes are deeply aware of this, as they are of the huge expense and distress remediation works have caused. A woman in my constituency said her daughter risked not being able to go to college because the family were so out of pocket. After receiving such an enormous bill for remedying defects in their apartments, they could not afford education costs for their children. That is the sort of impact this is having on families. We know from the working group report that up to 80% of apartments built between 1991 and 2013 may be defective. Of the 100,000 units, which is a massive figure, up to 90,000 are affected by the most serious issues, the fire safety defects, that arose primarily through shoddy work for which all sectors of the industry - professionals, contractors and subcontractors - were responsible. Limited regulatory oversight by State bodies was also a key contributory factor. We know from the working group that the estimated cost for remediation is approximately €2.5 billion and the report was clear the State should provide redress to owners to address defects through management companies, if necessary, and that retrospective financial support should be provided to owners who have or are paying towards remediation.I am conscious we had a cross-party briefing on the owner management companies issue last week. We know owner management companies are the most effective mechanism to deliver the whole building's safety that is essential in ensuring those living in multi-unit developments can live safely and be assured of appropriate remediation work. However, owner management companies, as we all know, are largely run by volunteer directors who may often lack the necessary expertise and experience to discharge the critical responsibilities they are doing voluntarily. The funding challenges being faced by many such companies encapsulate the real difficulties here. In practical terms, owner management companies cannot borrow. They will face lengthy processes to recover debt. They can only operate with the cash they have to hand and, therefore, the Government will need to provide proactive, hands-on support to such companies to ensure they can manage remediation works effectively to deliver safe buildings and outcomes. Any approach that only partially funds owner management companies for remediation works will risk leaving buildings unsafe and families in those buildings therefore unsafe. We need a public sector body underpinned by primary legislation. I know the Minister has acknowledged the need for legislation. We need a body to take charge of managing the remediation programme, as the Pyrite Resolution Board has done, in conjunction with owner management companies. The works should be fully funded upfront by the State and cost recovery should operate through the tax system. In addition, we will all be conscious that people who have already paid or are paying towards remediation costs will have to be included in the scheme because to do otherwise would lead to many owner management companies being unable to complete remediation works already under way. We need to ensure inclusion for owner occupiers and social landlords too, because housing associations form part of the occupiers and landlords for many multi-unit dwellings. We will be conscious of that as well. Support can be provided by means of grants based on the production of confirmation of payment of remediation costs by the relevant owner management company. I will highlight the need for the construction industry to contribute substantially to the cost of the remediation support scheme. That has been acknowledged. We in the Labour Party have called for a 2% levy on construction profits of construction companies from 2024 onwards for a period of at least ten years. It is necessary for those directly involved in creating the risk to also have a direct responsibility to bear a substantial portion of the costs. That is a crucial issue, not only to deal with past defects, but also to ensure one prevents and deters companies and construction operators from building defectively into the future. 	spk_257
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-12-14	dail	33	Nationalisation of Energy System: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_3	A win on wind is what we all seek to achieve. I welcome the opportunity to speak to this motion on energy and I thank the proposers for giving us the opportunity to debate this very important issue. Clearly, we are in an energy crisis, accompanied by other crises in housing, the cost of living and, of course, the existential climate emergency and this polycrisis is exacerbated by Russia's brutal war on Ukraine. As we debate energy here in a relatively well-heated Chamber, we might all reflect on what the citizens of Ukraine are enduring under the hideous Russian bombardment and, in particular, the horrific and illegal targeting of civilian energy infrastructure in Ukraine by Russia. To hear Ukrainians speaking about the absolute absence of heat, energy and light in 21st-century Europe is appalling and puts this debate in perspective. Nevertheless, in Ireland, we also have considerable difficulties with energy. We have a broken energy system, resulting from an undue liberalisation of the market and a lack of State investment in energy infrastructure, and that is a huge issue. I want to address a few of the points raised in the motion that highlight this difficulty and this legacy of a lack of planning for energy infrastructure but I will start by highlighting how much difficulty has been caused for our own residents and citizens throughout the country, who face such sharp hikes in energy bills. I heard this week from one constituent of mine who is living in a 110 sq. m apartment with her husband and two children. They have not had the heating turned on, given they are looking to save on energy costs and to do their bit in respect of carbon emissions, yet they have just been landed with a €1,300 gas bill for the past two months. They live in a block of 60 apartments and, therefore, according to their energy provider, they are being charged commercial rates, even though they have not had their own heating turned on. That is the sort of reality that faces many households and families with these exorbitant, as my constituent described them to me, energy bills, and it is why we need to look at radical, constructive and creative measures to address energy costs while meeting our vital climate emission targets. Turning to the substance of the motion, we have extensively debated in the House the issue of data centre connections and the significant burden on our energy system represented by data centres, not least the projected burden from the eight new data centre connections planned in the next two years. We in the Labour Party support a moratorium on new connections and we see in clear data from EirGrid that the system can barely manage even the current demand. The day for the highest energy consumption was this week, so we need to see radical action from the Government on this. The motion also highlights issues relating to transport, which is very important. There are concerns Government policy is looking to rely overly on a switch to electric vehicles rather than focusing on a switch away from private car use altogether. The Climate Change Advisory Council has called for swift and decisive action on this and, therefore, we must see a much greater priority on a move away from private cars altogether to public transport and to encouraging greater adoption of cycling and active travel. That is why the Labour Party's flagship climate measure in our budget 2023 proposal was the introduction, even for a six-month trial period, of a €9 monthly climate ticket offering unlimited access to public transport throughout Ireland, modelled on the German scheme. Based on that example and looking at what was generated through public transport fare revenue over 2019, we costed that proposal at €300 million for six months through the winter until the end of March. I appeal to the Minister of State to consider this as a proposal, albeit for next year, because in Germany, over three months, the scheme saved 1.8 million tonnes of CO2 emissions, equivalent to the annual output from 388,000 vehicles. In Ireland, that would equate to taking 23,000 cars off the road and would also enable a saving in the costs of transport for many people, households and families, which would be very welcome in the context of those rising energy bills I described. The motion goes on to cover measures relating to nationalising our energy infrastructure. Again, we in the Labour Party have called on the Government, on a number of occasions, to consider nationalising the Corrib gas field. At a minimum, we should start with nationalising the field that is producing about 25%, on some estimates, of Ireland's gas supply. Despite it producing that proportion, the prices are being set in an international context. We have called for temporary nationalisation in order that the price we would pay for this domestically produced gas supply would be set at the cost of production plus a margin for the operator, rather than at the much higher international market prices paid at present. The Government has the power to do this through laws put in place during the oil crisis of the 1970s. This too could result in a significant reduction in costs for a significant portion of our energy inputs. The motion also calls for the establishment of a State construction company to retrofit homes directly and we in the Labour Party very much welcome this proposal. In addition to the energy crisis, the overreliance on the market and what that has caused, we have seen seriously negative impacts of an overreliance on the private sector when it comes to housing in this country. We have spoken about this extensively in this House, most recently last night when my party colleague, Deputy Nash, put forward the Labour Party's opposition to Government housing policy, and when I yesterday questioned the Taoiseach on why we are not seeing a much greater State investment in the delivery of public and affordable housing.We have seen private construction taking over and yet becoming increasingly precarious. We have seen private sector resources directed to the building of hotels and office blocks rather than to housing and residential accommodation. We understand that only about a quarter of construction workers are now involved in residential building. This is at a time when more than 11,000 people are on housing lists. There is an extraordinary level of homelessness across the country. Clearly the Government's reliance on the private construction sector to provide an adequate supply of social and affordable housing has failed and has caused immense hardship and distress across the country. We employ tens of thousands of teachers and nurses to ensure our fundamental needs in healthcare and education are met, and yet our need and right to warm and adequate housing is treated differently. A State construction company could really address this difficulty and could resolve many issues relating to housing delivery and also relating to workers' rights and meeting climate targets, were we to see the work being channelled into retrofitting. I will finish by referring to a project in my constituency, namely, the construction skills programme being run by the St. Andrew's Resource Centre, Pearse Street in conjunction with Dublin Port. People from the long-term unemployment register are upskilling in order that they can take part in construction and in order that we can meet our labour skills shortage in construction.	spk_20

We were disappointed that the Government put down a countermotion in the Seanad. However, among other things, the Government countermotion called for a transition to a universal public childcare system. That is very welcome. We know that it is sorely needed by many parents and families across the country. The Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality has also called for it. Indeed, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality will be publishing its report on that tomorrow. The real problem remains a lack of spaces in childcare facilities. Constituents tell me every week about their difficulties in seeking to access a place in an early years setting. People in my own constituency cannot even get onto waiting lists for crèches in the area because there are so few spaces. What is the Government going to do to address the issue of the shortage of places in childcare settings around the country?	spk_100
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-12-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	At the risk of another Elvis moment, I wish the Taoiseach well in our last engagement on Leaders' Questions. I wish him well in whatever his future role may be.The Taoiseach may wish to indicate at this point in what role he will be returning to the Dáil in the new year. Suspicious minds - see what I did there? - are suggesting that it will be in a new role as Minister for Foreign Affairs but the Taoiseach may wish to confirm or deny that on the floor of the Chamber. Elvis has left the building now. On a serious note, the Taoiseach has been assuring us that his Ministers have been wide awake and not asleep at the wheel. It certainly appears that the officials of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, have been having some sleepless nights rushing through the drafting of the Planning and Development and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill 2022, which will be rushed through this House through all Stages this week. On 1 December, the Labour Party wrote to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, expressing our concern at the rushed-through nature of this planning law. The Planning and Development and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill is, as we said through our colleague, Senator Moynihan, the latest in a long line of housing, residential and planning Bills that have been sought to be passed into law at the last minute before either a summer or a Christmas recess. While we completely support measures which might see the acceleration of delivery of housing, our concern is that this Bill will not see the delivery of homes, which is so badly needed, and will not deliver the much-needed planning reforms. More importantly, it will not expedite the actual delivery of housing. Last week I raised the fact that there are 28,000 live planning permissions in the Dublin City Council area alone which have not been activated, which had gone through the planning process, but where we are seeing a delay in delivery. These undeveloped sites are fuelling high rates of homelessness, escalating rents and lengthening housing lists, with more than 11,000 people now on the housing list. We also see the sort of substandard living conditions I have spoken about in my own constituency, where 27 tenants were recently evicted and were living in what was essentially a firetrap of a building. Will the Taoiseach, the Government and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, take account of the warnings from its own agency, the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, that there has been hoarding and speculative behaviour in which developers and investors are acquiring planning permissions to hold as an asset and engaging in what we have seen described as land banking or land hoarding? This is a key issue and obstacle to the actual delivery of homes across cities and towns across this country. We have seen this concern raised not only by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service but also by the ESRI in a report stating that State intervention is now needed to end land speculation and land hoarding and to see a speeded-up delivery of housing. In particular, we in the Labour Party introduced a Bill to enact the Kenny report, a report which if enacted - this report will be 50 years old next year - would have done a great deal to ensure an end to land hoarding. Will the Taoiseach speed up and see to the passage of our Kenny report Bill?	spk_19

However, the difficulty for many people is that they are not seeing that outcome. They are hearing the Government listing off plans in progress, preparation being made or issues that will deliver on momentum, but they are not actually seeing the delivery of affordable homes for themselves or their children, friends and families. This is now eating into many different areas of life. As we know, it is affecting the ability of schools to attract teachers and the ability of hospitals to attract nurses and doctors. It is affecting every small business across the country in its ability to attract staff. We are seeing a failure of Government to deliver on outcomes. That is the key issue in housing. When we put forward constructive measures like the Kenny report Bill a year ago and our renters' rights Bill in October 2021, they are the sorts of measures we are putting forward as constructive ways to achieve the delivery of affordable homes. We ask the Government to take them on board and go with them in order to deliver on those outcomes.	spk_21

I understand the plan is to go to next week’s Cabinet meeting just before Christmas. That means we in opposition will not have the opportunity to scrutinise the plan in a Dáil debate. It means yet another delay in publishing much-needed plans to tackle the climate crisis. The latest update to the current plan shows that 23% of targets due for completion by the end of September were missed. When will we have the opportunity to debate the plan? Will it be as early as possible in the new year? How can we have confidence the Government will meet climate targets if everything is subject to such delay? We are seeing delays in the publication of the climate action plan, just as we saw delays in the carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings.	spk_92

Last week, I raised some stories about the human face of the housing crisis. They were stories about people at the sharp end of the housing crisis such as the 27 renters who were renting premises within a stone's throw of where I live in the south city centre off Camden Street that was not suitable for residential accommodation. These people were renting patently unsuitable premises because they could not find and afford anywhere else. This week, we heard about a shortage of teachers, particularly in Dublin, and difficulties retaining and recruiting teachers, nurses and staff in every sector from hospitality to retail to the professions to multinationals. The difficulty arises because people cannot get appropriate accommodation in our capital city. We have got to a point where there is now a Dublin penalty - a penalty people pay where they are seeking to work and live in Dublin but cannot afford to do so. I am hearing increasingly desperate stories of people earning what would be considered good wages who cannot afford suitable or appropriate accommodation anywhere within an easy commute of jobs in the city centre so it has become a Dublin penalty. We see the shortage of accommodation throughout the country, particularly in urban areas.  Like many colleagues, when I cycle around my constituency, I still see properties lying empty and sites undeveloped. In recent weeks, we heard from Dublin City Council that 28,000 live planning permissions in its area have not been activated. Enabling or facilitating the lying empty of premises and the non-activation of live planning permissions is fuelling the record homelessness figures that are so shameful for us all. This is what is fuelling escalating rents, lengthening housing lists and substandard living standards for so many people. To misappropriate the phrase of the writer O. Henry, Dublin will be a great place if they ever finish it. What we are not seeing from Government is a policy that will encourage and incentivise the finishing of Dublin and ensure that people will have decent places to live in our city centre and will be able to live and work in Dublin city, in particular, but also in towns and cities around the country without paying exorbitant rents and mortgages. We know this situation has arisen because of years of reliance on a policy that has treated property as an asset for investment and that sees housing as a commodity rather than as a public good or a human right. We need to move away from that. What is the Government going to do to ensure there is a clear carrot-and-stick approach - a carrot to incentivise those who are sitting on vacant sites to build homes on them and a stick to sanction those who let sites lie idle while people queue for housing and are unable to afford to live in the city?	spk_187

Labour has a proud record of seeking to deliver change to improve conditions for people and ensure we can deliver constructive ways to addresses crises that arise, particularly the housing crisis.

We welcomed that announcement, although we in the Labour Party felt it should have gone further. At such a crucial and concerning time, we ask that the roll-out be continued apace. Can the Tánaiste give a deadline for it?	spk_203
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-12-08	dail	33	Dublin Bay Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_46	"I move: ""That the Bill be now read a Second Time."" I thank the Minister for being here to take the Bill. I appreciate his having given me a commitment in October on the floor of the House on the need for year-round water quality monitoring. That is something I have sought for a long time. I will start by acknowledging his commitment to that and asking if we might have a timeline for when that might be brought in. I welcome our visitors in the Gallery who are here from a number of groups and who are activists on the issue of water quality and environment in Dublin Bay, particularly those from the SOS Dublin Bay group. I will speak a little more later on the work done by that group. I want to acknowledge the great interest in and support for the issue of the environment of Dublin Bay and the protection of the environment that I have experienced since I first started raising this issue. I raised it first in summer 2021 when I was running in the Dublin Bay South by-election. It was something that had become increasingly apparent to me during Covid and the lockdowns, starting in 2020 when I and many others around the country began to gain a greater appreciation of the need to enhance the environment around our coastlines and in our sea water. Many of us took up sea swimming and while I know it has become a bit of a cliché with the dryrobe-wearing sea swimmers, I plead guilty to being one of those. Jesting aside, Covid gave us a huge and renewed appreciation of the need to put in place proper structures and frameworks for preservation of our natural environment generally and particular our coastline, bay areas, swimming areas and seas. As an island nation, this should have been apparent to us a lot longer ago but perhaps we had disregarded it or neglected it as an issue.  It was in that vein that I first put together a Bill to ensure that that sort of statutory framework would be put in place for the preservation and enhancement of Dublin Bay. We drafted a Dublin Bay Bill. I was thrilled and honoured to be elected to represent Dublin Bay South in July 2021 and after that we worked on the Bill. It is almost exactly 12 months ago, on 7 December 2021, I introduced the Bill in the Dáil on First Stage and then it went into the lottery. This is my first lottery Bill and I was delighted when it was pulled out of the hat to have the opportunity to put it forward today on Second Stage. I hope that the Government will not oppose it. I see the Minister is shaking his head and I thank him. It is positive to hear that he will enable it to proceed because it is a Bill that should get cross-party support from Government and Opposition alike, because it enshrines such an important principle. If passed, it would promote a radical new vision for the protection and enhancement of the wonderful natural amenity on our doorstep that is Dublin Bay. It would establish a statutory Dublin Bay authority charged with preserving the distinctive character of Dublin Bay and protecting its ecology as a coastal resource. In particular, it would improve the amenity of the bay for sea swimmers, sailors, walkers along the shoreline and all of those who want to use the bay area. We look to establish an authority with its mandate to propose and promote policies and priorities for the protection and enhancement of the environment of Dublin Bay and of the natural habitats and wildlife in and around the bay; to co-ordinate, promote and support strategic planning and sustainable development in and around Dublin Bay; to make recommendations to regulate and control pollution in and around the bay; to promote public interest in and respect for Dublin Bay as a public amenity; and to co-ordinate the activities of public bodies and other organisations and persons in matters connected with the performance of its functions. Crucially, membership of the authority will come from elected members of the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly and others with a special expertise or interest in the future protection of the bay. That co-ordination and that democratic accountability is what we see as hugely important in the establishment of this statutory authority. We are conscious that there is already a non-statutory task force that has a similar role but which has no teeth because it is a non-statutory entity. Over the last year or so in particular, I have become very conscious of the very significant role that Dublin Port plays in the planning and development of the Dublin Bay area. The difficulty there is that Dublin Port should be just one of the stakeholders charged with a role in deciding on the future of Dublin Bay. It should not be the only one and there should be democratic accountability in the authority that has this role in ensuring the preservation of the environment of Dublin Bay. While environmental protection of Dublin Bay will be a priority for the new authority, it will also have a mandate to improve access and facilities around Dublin Bay and to improve public amenities in the area. The authority would have the aim of creating a better framework for environmental protection, governance and improvement specifically of water quality for all those who use the bay. The idea is that through the creation of this authority, we would have a strengthened framework for the protection of one of our great resources. It is a great resource not only for those of us in Dublin Bay South but all across Dublin. I know that Deputy Ó Ríordáin, representing Dublin Bay North, has as strong an interest in this as I do and, indeed, as any of us who represent coastal constituencies do. All of us in Dublin have strong connections to the body of water stretching from Howth to Sorrento Point. We have strong connections to the bay. It is the first thing we see when we fly in if we are on an aeroplane flying home or if we are in a ship coming in from abroad. It welcomes us. It is where many of us learn to swim, sail or paddle and, of course, it is the location of the opening chapter of the great Dublin novel  I return to the support I have received and the network of organisations that are supportive of this Bill. I am very proud to have worked with a large number of people and organisations on this Bill. In this regard, I give particular credit to our local councillors in Dublin Bay South, Mr. Dermot Lacey, Ms Mary Freehill and Mr. Kevin Donoghue. Councillor Lacey, in particular, has been calling for a co-ordinated statutory authority to take over the governance of Dublin Bay for a long time. I have also worked with the group SOS Dublin Bay, an important local group with a considerable number of supporters that launched some time ago a petition called SOS – Save Our Sea in Dublin Bay. The petition now has more than 20,000 signatures, which again shows the strength of feeling on this issue. The group was formed arising from concerns about water quality in the bay area. I have also worked with swimmers from the Half Moon Club in Poolbeg. A large group of us swim very regularly off the South Wall. We had a new ladder put up by Dublin Port recently. We call ourselves the Half Moon Mad Yokes, a somewhat ironic name. Swimming is hugely important for people's physical and mental health. I have also had great support from the local residents' group SAMRA, the Sandymount and Merrion Residents Association, which has been really supportive from the very start. I held a public meeting in Sandymount on 13 September. I was staggered to see how many people came along. They included councillors from Dublin Bay South, Labour Party councillors from Dún Laoghaire and many people with no party affiliation, including local residents and those from further afield, who simply wanted to see a structure put in place for the preservation and improvement of the Dublin Bay area. To return to the existing structure, or lack thereof, the informal task force currently has no statutory powers. There is, therefore, a lack of co-ordination with regard to the protection and enhancement of the wonderful amenity that is Dublin Bay. Nowhere is this more evident than in the crumbling dereliction of the old Sandymount and Blackrock baths, which anybody who goes up and down the coast will be familiar with. There is such a severe lack of facilities for those who want to use the sea or bay in a more meaningful manner, including those who want to swim but who lack really good facilities. We see good facilities in other countries. In Barcelona, for example, the port has been greatly improved as a public amenity. We see the lidos in London and all sorts of other examples of where much better facilities have been provided and much better use has been made of a city coastline. We should have a lido with public access at George's Dock for all swimmers. That is the sort of initiative that a new authority with statutory powers could deliver. There is an example elsewhere of this sort of statutory model. On the east coast of the United States, a statutory task force was established some years ago for Chesapeake Bay to preserve it, improve its water quality standards and encourage its greater use as a public amenity. The deterioration and pollution of Chesapeake Bay in the 1980s caused local public leaders to come together to form this task force. That focus saw significant increases in federal funding to preserve the bay and resulted in very much improved water standards and more responsible use of the bay for local communities. That is the sort of community facility we want to see established in and around Dublin Bay. We have some great examples of enhancements. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, for example, enhanced the Dún Laoghaire baths, which are due to open next week. The Clontarf coastal bicycle route has greatly improved facilities but there is no co-ordination, nor is there a structural statutory framework to co-ordinate the preservation and enhancement of the bay area. That is why we are calling on colleagues from all parties in the Government to support this Bill.  My colleague Deputy Ó Ríordáin will speak further about why we need to see this legislation put in place."	spk_285

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-12-08	dail	33	Dublin Bay Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_46	I thank the Minister of State for his very generous closing remarks and, indeed, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, for his very comprehensive response earlier. I absolutely agree with the Minister of State. I would be delighted to move forward with this Bill in a spirit of collaboration as he and the Minister have suggested. Indeed, I already indicated to the Minister that I will take him up on his offer of meeting with officials in January to see how we can make progress with this Bill. I have a good track record of working from Opposition with the Government to ensure the passage of legislation. I am absolutely open to amending and improving on the Bill, where necessary, to ensure we see the principles it enshrines brought in. I absolutely acknowledge that a great deal of good work is going on to improve and enhance the amenity of Dublin Bay. The core issue here is the lack of co-ordination, the lack of joined-up thinking and the lack of a framework within which the work can continue and within which there will be democratic accountability. There are four key principles I want to see brought in. They are currently lacking and this Bill would address them. One of them is the need to ensure adequate protection for the environment. That is absolutely huge. Clearly, as the Minister of State and others have pointed out, this is a biosphere. We have a UNESCO designation for the bay and we need to ensure that there is a proper framework in place to ensure its protection and sustainable development. Second, we need to ensure it is improved as a public amenity. The Minister of State correctly pointed out the cultural significance of the bay, as did Deputy Ó Snodaigh and others. I do not think anyone but Deputy Ó Snodaigh can claim to have had the contents of the bay come into their bedrooms. However, the stories other colleagues have told of their experiences of Dublin Bay and my experience as someone who swims in the bay every week speak to its cultural significance for all of us. Beyond the public amenity aspect, the bay has a visceral importance. The third issue is the lack of democratic accountability in the framework for the planning and development of the bay area. The fourth issue, and probably the overarching one, concerns co-ordination and the need for joined-up thinking. My colleague, Dermot Lacey, to whom I referred earlier and who has done much work to improve co-ordination of the Dublin Bay area, has spoken about how nine different statutory agencies currently have responsibility. We know there are four Dublin councils. Others have spoken about the great initiatives taken in Fingal, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Dublin City Council in respect of the bay amenity, but there is a need for a joined-up co-ordinating body with statutory power that will also have democratic accountability. That is what we seek to address in the Bill in order that the environmental amenity will be protected and the public realm will be too. Deputy Ó Ríordáin spoke eloquently about that. I am happy to work with Government to ensure that we can bring into being a legislative framework to address the four concerns around environment, public amenity, democratic accountability and co-ordination. I will speak on some of the issues colleagues raised. I acknowledge those who spoke and the great support we have got on a cross-party basis, not only from the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister, Deputy O’Brien, but also from Deputies Boyd Barrett, Andrews, Devlin and Ó Snodaigh. I acknowledge Deputy Carroll MacNeill, who cannot be here but who previously indicated great support and who has worked with me on the water quality issue. On that issue, section 6 was addressed by the Minister in some detail. That section would seek to amend the bathing water regulations and ensure we have water quality monitoring and data over the whole year. I thank SOS Dublin Bay for working with me on this provision and I acknowledge the visitors in the Gallery and all the activists who have worked on the issue of water quality. I listened carefully to what the Minister said and have engaged with Uisce Éireann or Irish Water on UV testing. I am delighted about the UCC project that is under way. I was also delighted to hear both Ministers speak of the need for real-time monitoring to ensure informed decision-making for those who wish to swim in the bay. However, those comments illustrate the lack of coherence around the argument against year-round water quality monitoring. It is a little bit like the old, derided policy in the US military, “Don’t ask, don’t tell”. The argument is if we do testing year round and the water quality is poor, we will have to stop people swimming, the water will be designated as unswimmable and we will have to close designated swimming areas. That misses the point. We need to use the data to improve water quality and to change things. It is like telling someone not to go to the doctor because they might get a diagnosis. The point is to use the diagnosis to avail of treatment and engage in treating the water, improving water quality and trying to find out what is wrong with it. We do not want to swim in unsafe water - nobody does - but we want to swim year-round. I swam three times last weekend. There were huge crowds swimming around the bay. Colleagues have spoken of the huge numbers in their areas now swimming year-round. The reality is the whole of Dublin Bay is now a designated bathing area. My Labour colleague, Martha Fanning, swims at Blackrock DART station and Williamstown, which were not thought of as swimming areas and which are not designated as such. We swim off the South Wall at the Half Moon Swimming and Water Polo Club. It used to be a very underused area but now huge numbers of people use it. The whole year is now a bathing season because so many people have embraced it. It is not just about swimmers. Many others use the bay and would like to see water quality improved. I hear from constituents about dead birds, dead seagulls and even dead foxes on the beach. Others have spoken of dog fouling. It is a serious issue. There are huge concerns regarding sewage. We have spoken about the Ringsend waste water treatment plant. Not long ago, 300,000 tonnes of sewage sludge was dumped into Dublin Bay every year. Welcome measures are under way to address this, but we still lack a co-ordinated statutory framework to address issues around pollution and water quality and ensure protection for the environment and protection and enhancement of the public realm and the public amenity that is the bay. That brings me to the structure of the new authority. To address issues the Minister raised, we sought in the Bill to use existing frameworks. The Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly already has power to establish special committees and section 2 of the Bill would establish this statutory authority as a special committee. We are trying to use existing framework and structures to ensure co-ordination is possible. We seek to ensure there will be democratically elected members of the assembly who will be members of the authority and to build on the existing structures like the biosphere partnership to ensure joined-up thinking. I acknowledge the work of the Minister of State’s colleague, John Gormley, who in 2008 sought to bring a co-ordinated, cross-party, cross-institutional approach to the management of Dublin Bay through his Dublin Bay task force. That was an important initiative but ongoing issues around water quality, lack of enhancement and protection for the public amenity and environment of the bay indicate the need for a stronger overarching body to control the management, development and enhancement of the bay. This need was brought home strongly to me when I was first elected, had a tour from Dublin Port and heard of their great plans for development of lands along the South Wall. I have also seen their work with BirdWatch Ireland, which is welcome. I have met with Covanta, which has a huge stake in the area surrounding Ringsend and Poolbeg. We need to ensure that representatives of the public interest play a central role in planning what happens with Dublin Bay, not just at Poolbeg and Ringsend in my constituency or Sandymount and Merrion but all around it. The Bill refers to Dublin Bay from the Baily Lighthouse to Sorrento Point and that overarching control, management and co-ordination needs to be brought about through a measure like the Dublin Bay authority. I look forward to working with the Minister of State, his colleagues in government and colleagues cross-party to ensure this Bill or the principles in it are enshrined in law. I thank all the activists. I have mentioned SAMRA and SOS Dublin Bay but there is also the seal sanctuary, the Commodore's in Dún Laoghaire, Flossie and the Beach Cleaners, the Coastal Concern Alliance and many more who have worked hard on a voluntary basis to enhance Dublin Bay. I thank my political advisor, Chloe Manahan, who has worked closely with me on this, and Finbarr O’Malley, our drafter, who worked on the text of the Bill. It is such an important principle that we would see a co-ordinated statutory body with a democratic legitimacy and accountability, as well as the central responsibility for the planning, protection and enhancement of Dublin Bay. For far too long, we have talked about this. John Gormley spoke about it in 2008 and tried to work on it. We now need to see a whole-of-government approach, working with partners in opposition, to ensure future protection and enhancement of Dublin Bay. This Bill represents a necessary first step to change how we treat and see Dublin Bay, to stop us taking it for granted and to realise its remarkable potential, not just for all of us but also for future generations. I thank colleagues for their great support. I also thank our visitors in the Gallery for their activism and work. I look forward to working with others to ensure that this Bill becomes law.	spk_304
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-12-07	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_10	The Labour Party reiterates its support for the call for more time on Report Stage to debate the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill. It would be sensible to adjourn the debate rather than to conclude the debate after two hours today, and I note the Taoiseach's comments that the Whips should co-ordinate on that matter. A substantial number of amendments have been tabled and concerns have been raised about flaws in the Bill, therefore, it would be sensible to adjourn the debate and give it a little more time next week. That is the wish of all of us in opposition. I raise the issue of increasing concerns among parents and teachers in recent weeks. They have been expressing their concern about severe staff shortages in schools, which was the subject of an earlier debate today. I am also increasingly hearing of frustration from parents of younger children, children of preschool age, who cannot access a place for their child in early years education and care in my constituency and others around the country. I have raised this previously and thank the Taoiseach for his engagement on specific issues about individual crèche closures, but this is part of a broader, systematic problem with childcare and early years education in this country. We need urgent State intervention to address this problem. What is lacking is a real acknowledgement at the centre of Government of the lack of provision of childcare services for children and parents who rely on childcare providers and, indeed, a lack of supports for providers that are closing. I acknowledge incremental steps have been taken. In particular, we in the Labour Party have welcomed the establishment of the employment regulation order for early years workers and professionals. I also acknowledge the Big Start campaign and SIPTU's input into that. Notwithstanding improvements in pay for professionals, there is still a problematic and flawed system for parents. They are now being told to reserve their child's place when at the very early stages of pregnancy, before the child is even born, and even then they cannot be sure of getting a place at a childcare facility. Tonight, Labour Senators will table a motion in the Seanad to address the crisis in Ireland's childcare system and to call for a change in policy to ensure we no longer have the postcode lottery that so often determines the availability of places and their affordability. High, exorbitant and rising fees are a huge issue for many parents. Several parents have come to me to say they simply cannot afford a childcare place even where there is one available. Let us remember Ireland has the highest proportion of private providers of childcare in the OECD and many smaller providers are being squeezed on costs. We need a universal, publicly-funded childcare system in Ireland and we in the Labour Party have been calling for that consistently. Will the Taoiseach commit to the rolling out of such a scheme and will he commit to reduce the cost of childcare as part of that to a cap of €200 per month per child, as we have sought?	spk_64
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-12-07	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_10	I thank the Taoiseach for that engagement. However, I was in London to meet with Keir Starmer and other colleagues from our sister party, the British Labour Party, as well as with the Irish ambassador, Martin Fraser. While we were there, a report was published by the Institute for Public Policy Research and the charity, Save the Children, that made a recommendation central to this point of childcare. It recommends a universal childcare guarantee be introduced in Britain as a means of boosting economic growth and cutting inequality, particularly gender inequality. That sort of visionary moment is needed here. We need to see a vision set out for the provision of early years education here in Ireland, a vision akin to that of the Fianna Fáil Minister, Donogh O'Malley, 50 years ago, when he introduced free secondary education for all children. It was a groundbreaking vision that has changed Irish society so much in the intervening half century. However, we need to see that vision rolled out and a Donogh O'Malley moment for early years education. We need to see a universal childcare guarantee of the sort being pushed for in Britain done here. Will the Government commit to that sort of visionary approach to childcare in early years education?	spk_66

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-12-01	dail	33	Address by H.E. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission	dbsect_33	Cuirim fáilte roimh an Uachtarán. It is my honour, on behalf of the Labour Party, to welcome her here to address our Oireachtas. I express our appreciation for her warm and optimistic words by way of address to us today. I also thank her for not only quoting our iconic first woman President, Mary Robinson, but also that iconic band the Saw Doctors. We all appreciated her quoting those. On a more serious note, I also welcome the President's officials and our distinguished guests today, the Ukrainian ambassador in particular. I thank the President for her words and her long-standing support for Ireland, both personally and through the Commission more generally, as we have moved through the ongoing fallout for this country from the Brexit decision and as we move to secure a resolution on the Northern Ireland protocol. We thank the President for her solidarity on that front too. The President made history as the first woman to lead the Commission and, as I have said, she has quoted from our first woman President here, Mary Robinson. We are all conscious of the huge gains that have been made for women's rights and for equality more generally in this country as a result of EU membership. It should be noted that Ireland has led on equality issues too. We have led across Europe in our referendum on marriage equality in 2015 and in our historic referendum to bring about abortion rights for women in 2018. We have led in some areas. However, we still have a lot more to do. While the President will hear from a number of women Deputies today, there are still far too few of us in the Dáil. Only 23% - fewer than one in four - of our Deputies are women, so on that front at least we have some way to go. In her tenure as President of the Commission, Ms von der Leyen has faced some of the greatest challenges that have bound us closer together as a European Union. These include Brexit, to which I have referred, the dreadful Covid pandemic, and more recently, Russia's brutal war on Ukraine. These challenges have reminded us all of the importance of the EU as a peace project, a collective endeavour and a model for promoting economic and social progress. In this country we are particularly conscious that the financial crash damaged the Union and important lessons were eventually learned. We hope the mistakes made then by the EU and the European Central Bank, ECB, will never be repeated. What all these crises have shown is the critical importance of the role of the state, and of collective action across states, in tackling crises and problems. We have learned that over-reliance on the market will not solve complex transnational and international problems. At EU level, the energy crisis brought on by Putin’s imperial war of conquest in Ukraine has shown the weaknesses of our artificially constructed energy markets, as record profits are made on renewable electricity due to the reliance on gas prices as a reference for setting electricity prices. That has been acknowledged at EU level. Too often in this country the excuse of EU competition rules is used as a barrier to necessary State action and it has also become a shield for Departments to put social services out to tender that should instead be run and funded directly by the State. However, it must be acknowledged, and it is welcome, that at EU level we have seen the benefits of transnational action on collective procurement for Covid vaccines, which was a huge benefit to this country and other countries during the pandemic. That ensured that, as a smaller country, we were able to secure supplies alongside larger countries. The need for collective action is nowhere more apparent than in response to the brutal war in Ukraine. The strong action of the EU, in which Ireland has played a strong role, in delivering multiple rounds of sanctions against Russia has been welcome but we can do more. Our Government has failed to take up our Labour Party's proposal of Magnitsky legislation to punish human rights abusers and seize their assets. I would ask that the Commission would consider acting on this in an EU-wide approach to bring together a European Magnitsky law. On behalf of my party I welcome the President's move to establish a court to investigate and prosecute Russian crimes in Ukraine. That is a hugely important collective endeavour. The war has also reminded us, as the President has said, of our enslavement to Russian fossil fuels across this Continent and of the need for swifter transformative climate action to address the existential climate emergency. The EU represents our best collective chance to achieve this by ensuring a community of 500 million people decarbonises in speedy time. More than ever we need the European Green Deal to be translated into action in our countries, across Europe and across the world, by supporting developing countries with a just transition and adequate resources to tackle the adverse effects of the climate emergency. Our party is the Irish member of the Party of European Socialists, PES. When I addressed the PES leaders conference in Berlin six weeks ago, I outlined the need for more action at EU level on workers’ rights, childcare, housing and the cost of living and on delivering the social Europe, that collective goal to which the Labour Party and the PES aspire. While we recognise the huge achievements of the EU in delivering rights for workers and women and in delivering maternity leave and employment protection rights, we recognise there is still much more to do. In Ireland we are seeking to bring forward legislation to provide for leave for women and their partners undergoing fertility treatment and to support women during early miscarriage. Again, we are urging the Commission to take this up at EU level. I thank the President again on behalf of the Labour Party for her unwavering support for the peace process, for her stated commitment to ensuring the Good Friday Agreement will be protected, and for her optimism.	spk_237
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-12-01	dail	33	Local Government (Maternity Protection and Other Measures for Members of Local Authorities) Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_35	"On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the Bill. I commend the Minister of State on all the work that has been done on its provisions and on the engagement and consultation with the different groups involved. In my role as vice chair of the women's caucus, I am appreciative of the consultation with our members. We had long expressed a desire to see provision made for maternity protection for women representatives in local government. As the Chair of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality, I am glad to see this Bill being introduced. I acknowledge the other members of the joint committee, including Deputy Cronin. They will also welcome this Bill because it gives affect to recommendation 23(a) of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality. The assembly recommended to us that family friendly practices for all representatives elected to public office should be improved by ""making maternity, paternity and parental leave available to all elected representatives, including Ministers"". It is welcome, therefore, to see this legislation coming forward and, like others, I hope for its speedy passage. The Minister of State referred to the consultation and the groups with which he had worked on this legislation. It is good to acknowledge the cross-party group of councillors, the AILG and the stakeholders working on women's rights and equality issues, namely, the NWCI, See Her Elected and Women for Election. I commend the great work being done by those groups in seeking to increase the levels of representation of women in politics at national and local level. As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights previously, I authored a 2009 report on women's participation in politics in which we coined the phrase ""the five Cs"". The latter has been used quite extensively since then in expressing, in a clear way, the obstacles faced by women in engaging in more active and more equal participation in public life. The five Cs are that women tend to have a lack of confidence compared with male counterparts, we tend to have a lack of cash in comparison with men, and this is being addressed through gender pay gap legislation, and there is also an old boys culture throughout politics that holds women back. In addition to those three Cs of confidence, cash and culture, a fourth C stands for childcare. In this regard, we again see a lack of support in childcare and maternity provision as being a major factor, as the Minister of State said, in preventing women's career progression through political Iife. We also identified a fifth C, because those four Cs could be said to exist in all careers and professions and that they hold women back. The fifth C in the context of political life represents candidate selection procedures. We recommended in 2009 that this matter should be addressed through the introduction of gender quota legislation. This recommendation, I am glad to say, was adopted in 2012, as colleagues will all be aware. We now have a 30% gender quota, which is due to rise to 40%. That will happen in the next general election. This quota only applies to general election candidacy and only to political parties in requiring them to select at least 30% of their candidates of each gender. That will rise to 40% at the next general election. This quota, which was the subject of some controversy when it was first introduced in 2012, has been effective. We saw a significant increase, from 16% to 22%, in the number of female Deputies in the Dáil after the first general election in which it applied, namely, that held in 2015. Unfortunately, some stagnation has occurred since, as the Minister of State will be aware. I refer to the 2020 general election. My election to the Dáil last summer meant that we reached the dizzy heights of 23% of Deputies being women. This is still far too low. This is the highest number we have ever had of women representatives in public life, with 37 out of 160 Deputies being women, but it is still far too low. As the Minister of State will be well aware, we stand at about 100 in the world rankings in the Inter-Parliamentary Union of women's representation in political life. We clearly need to do more to address the other four Cs to which I refer. What I am saying in a roundabout way is that I welcome this legislation because it addresses one of the five Cs, namely, the childcare issue, at local government level. We are all conscious that local elections can often form an important pipeline into national politics. We are also aware that there are far too few women involved at local government level. The Minister of State gave a figure of 24% of women being elected in 2019. At less than a quarter of total representation, this is again far too low. In the context of quotas, not only did the citizens' assembly recommend the extension of maternity and other forms of parental leave to elected representatives, it was also very clear about its wish to see the gender quota extended beyond general elections to local, Seanad and European Parliament elections. This is covered in recommendation 20. The Joint Committee on Gender Equality, with which the Minister of State's Department has engaged - and we are very appreciative of the level of engagement from across the Government - will be publishing its report on 15 December. We will be making recommendations on constitutional change in keeping with the citizens' assembly recommendations 1 to 3, inclusive. We are clearly seeking to address unequal representation of women across many different areas of life and not just in public life and politics. This legislation is very much in keeping with the recommendations of the citizens' assembly on politics, albeit that we still do not have the quota extension to local elections. My request, in the context of recommendation 20, is that the Minister of State would consider the possibility of introducing legislation to extend the quota to local elections. This is something with which we have grappled for some time. The women's caucus has also been working on this issue. Concern has been expressed that there is no direct link between the number of seats filled by parties at local elections and funding. We were able to use such a link in the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 to ensure that a sanction would apply in situations where parties did not fulfil their gender quotas in candidate selection at general elections, with funding being cut by 50%. The same level of direct sanction does not exist in this regard, but it would still be perfectly possible to require, for example, some cut in funding as a result of a failure to meet a quota in local elections as well. I am just putting that out as a possibility because it is something we have deliberated on in the Joint Committee on Gender Equality. This issue has been raised on several occasions by the women's caucus and the citizens' assembly. To return to the provisions of the Bill, as the Minister of State indicated and as the explanatory memorandum outlines, the purpose of this legislation is twofold. It is to extend maternity protection provisions to those who are officeholders, elected councillors, despite their not being employees. I very much welcome this aspect. Statutory maternity leave will now be provided for local authority elected members. This is the first and very welcome aim. The second, and also very welcome, aim is to enable and provide the option for an elected member absent from local authority, either because of maternity leave or through illness or in good faith for another reason, to nominate a temporary substitute to undertake their duties until their return. This is also welcome. It is something we have discussed and deliberated on for some time. It is one thing to be provided with the facility to take leave, but it is quite another thing to be able to ensure that duties are fulfilled while an officeholder is out on leave. I am one of the few members of the Oireachtas who had a baby while serving as a Member. I was pregnant with my second daughter when I was elected to the Seanad for the first time in 2007. I recall clearly taking time out from appearing in the Seanad, but being conscious that no support was available, beyond the very welcome Oireachtas crèche, which I did use. It was very helpful that it was available part-time so I could come in for reduced hours to speak on debates in the Seanad. Certainly, though, other supports are clearly necessary. Other colleagues talked about the Minister, Deputy McEntee. It is very positive that she is being facilitated by other Government colleagues. It is certainly necessary, however, that we have a process, a system in place to ensure that Ministers can and do take maternity leave. I very much welcome the change in Oireachtas procedures now whereby Members who go on maternity leave can avail of additional administrative support. This is very welcome. It provides one way in which we see provision being made for public duties to be carried while facilitating a woman in taking necessary leave in the early months following the baby's birth. This is very important. At council level, a somewhat different provision, the temporary substitute proposition, is being put forward in the Bill. This is welcome and practical. It is also practical that it is being presented as an option. Clearly, it is not something that every woman who takes leave may wish to do, but it does exist as an option. Constitutional concerns have been raised.I looked again at Article 28A of the Constitution. I look at the current provision in section 19 of the 2001 Local Government Act, where there is already provision for co-option. This is constitutionally robust. Article 28A of the Constitution refers to ""such directly elected local authorities as may be determined by law"". We can as legislators provide for the definition of ""casual vacancy"", which is precisely what is being done here. We can determine how, by law, local authorities are elected and what is a local authority that is directly elected. The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, stated himself the current provision is clearly not only inadequate, but disrespectful and inappropriate for a woman taking maternity leave who has to seek this convoluted mechanism. The Minister of State put it eloquently, that a female councillor will not need to ""go cap in hand"" to seek permission to take leave. That is simply not tenable in contemporary society. We need to be offering supports and facilitating women in taking necessary maternity leave. We have moved to a point in society where it is absolutely necessary for us to do this. The temporary substitution provision is a way of doing this and ensuring that a councillor who wishes to do so can ensure that her public duties are undertaken in her temporary absence and that a casual vacancy does not arise as a result. Section 2 of the Bill makes clear provision for the termination of the co-option in the proposed new section 19A(6). I suppose there might well be concerns raised about whether one could have two parallel representatives. Obviously, we can tease this out on Committee Stage. In section 2 and the proposed new section 19A(6), the Minister of State has made clear provision as to how the co-option or temporary substitution is to be terminated and that covers off that potential for parallel or duplicate representation which might well be raised by those with concerns about the Bill. As I say, we can perhaps have a more precise discussion of that provision on Committee Stage but the termination of the co-option is clearly set out. The Minister of State has also stated that, for reasons of equality, he is not confining the temporary substitution provision to women taking maternity leave and he is also covering those who need to take leave through illness or in good faith for another reason. We might discuss further on Committee Stage the provision, ""in good faith for another reason"". How would that work? Would it cover, for example, short absences for a bereavement? Is that envisaged? Does that undermine the clear intent here, which is a gender-equality intent to encourage more women into politics to ensure there are supports for those women who need to take maternity leave while also fulfilling functions as a councillor? We might need to discuss that a little more on Committee Stage. While this is a welcome Bill and I want to see its speedy progression, of course, as the Minister of State himself has said, there is more to be done to build on this. This Bill refers to one key part of recommendation 23(a) of the citizens' assembly related to maternity leave but recommendation 23(a) also talks about paternity and parental leave. The Minister of State has indicated his intention to review that provision once this Bill is through and that is a sensible way of approaching this. We can look then at how we can extend other forms of parental and paternity leave and parents' leave to elected representatives, obviously, not only at local level but at all levels. In terms of leave provision, I also want to mention a Labour initiative I put forward in the Seanad that is currently on Committee Stage in the Seanad and was not opposed by Government, that is, the Organisation of Working Time (Reproductive Health Related Leave) Bill 2021. Like the Organisation of Working Time (Domestic Violence Leave) Bill 2020 proposed by Sinn Féin, it would amend the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 by providing for a short and contained period of leave, in our case for women experiencing early miscarriage for whom there is currently no provision in law. We have called for an up-to-20-day period of paid leave for early miscarriage and up to ten days' leave for access to reproductive healthcare treatment. I am conscious the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, has indicated that he is commissioning research on the introduction of provision for early miscarriage leave. There is some progress being made on that. I highlight that as another gap in current provisions for leave, which impacts on women's equal progression in workplaces. I should say that the impetus for the Organisation of Working Time (Reproductive Health Related Leave) Bill 2021 came from the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, which came to us to say that so many of its members had to take holiday time or sick leave where they had experienced early miscarriage, and that there was a taboo around this. Clearly, a large number of primary school teachers being women, the INTO felt this was a gender-equality issue and approached me about bringing forward legislation on it. It has had a long genesis. There is clearly a real need there to ensure that women enduring early miscarriage have some provision made through our workplace entitlements and workplace laws. Finally, to return to the five Cs, there is a range of measures that need to be adopted to ensure greater representation for women in political life at all levels. This Bill forms an important part of the package of measures that are necessary. I very much welcome its introduction and look forward to working with the Minister of State to ensure its speedy passage, together with all the other recommendations of the citizens' assembly that we want to see implemented too."	spk_276
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-11-30	dail	33	Drugs Policy: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I am very glad to have the opportunity to close this debate on behalf of the Labour Party. I thank colleagues across the House for the strong support that has been shown today for this important motion. I commend my colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, who is also our justice spokesperson. Long before he was our justice spokesperson, however, he led for us on the policy of decriminalisation and on bringing people with him to ensure we see a more practical, compassionate, humane and evidence-based approach to drug policy in this country. I also commend Labour Youth, our youth wing, which has been to the fore in leading for us on this within the party. In particular, I thank Mr. Conal O'Boyle, Mr. Hugh Murphy and Mr. James Kearney, who have really led the campaign within Labour Youth and who join us in the Gallery. I commend the many front-line support workers working in drug rehabilitation and treatment, many of whom have worked with us on shaping and supporting this motion. I thank the CityWide drugs crisis campaign, Ana Liffey Drug Project, Coolmine Drug Rehab Centre and Merchants Quay Ireland. I commend all the work that has been done there. I will also mention the Ringsend and District Response to Drugs in my own constituency. I thank all of those who work so hard to deal with and address those who are enduring addiction. This is an issue that is very close to my own heart. For many years, I practised as a barrister. I did much criminal defence work and much work in the District Court. Many of my clients were themselves in addiction. Their addiction had been a pathway into criminality. I saw very close-up the immense destruction and devastation wreaked as a consequence drug addiction. I always think of one young mother I represented in court who was in and out of prison. She was convicted time after time of theft-related offences because she was stealing to feed a habit. She was in and out of prison. The only time she looked healthy was when she had spent time in prison and was securing medical support for her addiction. When I thought of the harm caused to all the victims of the crimes committed by clients of mine and others, the enormous harm to the families of those in addiction and the huge physical and mental health impacts upon those people as a result of their addiction, it certainly made me realise the need for a change in policy. What we have heard across the House today is a recognition by all of us as legislators, both in and out of Government, of the need for change in policy. It is very welcome that the Government is not opposing this motion. It is very welcome to hear the Minister of State's colleagues speak about the legislation on supervised injection facilities, which has been in place since 2017 and which was driven by my colleague Deputy Ó Ríordáin. It is very welcome to hear some lip service being given to a health-led policy to addiction by this Government. What we are not seeing is the drive and political will necessary to deliver that very necessary change in policy to a health-led, evidence-based approach and to a policy where we can decriminalise the user and see addiction as a health issue for which we can put in place the necessary State supports to bring people out of addiction and rehabilitate them, and treat addiction in a compassionate way as a health-related issue. This is an issue throughout the country, as my colleagues have pointed out. I was in County Limerick recently with Ana Liffey Drug Project, which told me that this is all across the country. We are not only seeing this in urban settings but in rural settings too. It is an issue in my constituency. I recently met with communities, businesses and households in the south inner city who have been impacted very much by the devastation wreaked by criminal gangs and drug gangs. We need to move it out of this. The war on drugs has not been won. The criminal justice approach is not achieving the necessary results for communities and individuals. We need to move to a different approach. The criminal justice approach, which is a criminalisation model, has not stopped criminal gangs from terrorising communities in urban and rural areas alike. It has not stopped people using drugs because, as our motion points out, we are seeing widespread usage. It has not stopped people dying and, indeed, the figures are very stark. More than 10,000 lives have been lost in the past 25 years in this country as a result of addiction. That is a dreadful figure we simply cannot continue to tolerate. We have moved beyond stigmatisation. We moved to a situation where we can now talk very openly about deaths due to subjects that were perhaps stigmatised in the past, such as suicide and so on. Now, however, we need to talk about how we save those lives and how we save families whose loved ones have been lost through addiction. Criminal justice policies have not prevented deaths. What they have done, unfortunately, is create unnecessary stigmatisation, particularly of young people. We are seeing so many prosecutions, arrests and convictions for possession for personal use. As others said, this is not a good use of Garda time. This is creating unnecessary stigmatisation for young people, in particular those in disadvantaged communities. In 2020 - a pandemic year - there were nearly 15,000 arrests for possession of drugs for personal use in this country. This is not the right way nor a practical or compassionate way to approach issues around addiction, which should be dealt with as healthcare policies. The Minister of State in his speech referred to what happened this year at the Electric Picnic festival in County Laois with the pilot model of adopting what was genuinely a health-led approach, which saw the HSE launch a landmark drug testing facility that enabled festivalgoers to forfeit their drugs anonymously for testing. We saw a huge media focus on this and on the various pitfalls that were predicted. The programme was successful by any measure, however. Dangerously potent substances were found in some of the samples submitted, including three entirely new psychoactive substances. The findings immediately led to three communications to festivalgoers advising them of risk. That experience speaks for itself. It speaks to how a genuine harm reduction model can save lives and provide a new and better approach to drug policy. I will finish by noting that this is not a new debate. I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in 2015. We produced a report that again achieved cross-party consensus on the need to move to the Portugal model, about which others have spoken, with a focus on decriminalisation of the user. Let us see the Government grab the nettle and take the initiative now. Let us hear the Minister of State name a date for the setting up of a citizens' assembly. There is very significant support for it across this House. He should name the date. Before Christmas, let us hear a date being set in order that we can move towards a genuine, compassionate, evidence-based and health-led approach to drug policy in this country.	spk_45
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-11-30	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	I raise the increasingly desperate plight of many at the sharp end of the housing disaster. I am not just speaking about the 11,000 people we now know are on the homeless list, including many thousands of children. That is bad and shocking enough as a figure, but there are many more living in precarious accommodation, facing eviction and who do not know where they will have to move to. Last week I raised the plight of residents of a shared house in Rathmines Road in my constituency faced with an eviction notice where a landlord wishes to sell, with no inkling of where they will be able to move to. Today, I raise another group of people in my constituency, a stone's throw from where I live, in the ironically named Liberty Lane off Camden Street. I commend Kitty Holland in  I visited Liberty Lane this morning. There is a prefabricated structure that looks like a temporary office block in which 27 people live. These 27 people are being charged between €500 and €600 per month and are sharing three toilets, two showers and one kitchen in a prefab structure that is now being closed down as a fire hazard. They work and study here, and contribute to our economy. They are people from other countries who cannot source appropriate accommodation anywhere in Dublin. This is one example of the sharp end of the housing disaster.  Yesterday the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, revealed that the rental market has shrunk by 43,000 homes in the last five years, with many landlords seeking to exit the market. That gives a clear picture of the acute and desperate crisis facing renters. There is precarious accommodation, in many cases unsuitable or inappropriate. If ours was a functioning housing system, many of those in such precarious accommodation would have been housed in public housing on public land. Instead, we saw four wasted years between 2016 and 2020, where Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael squandered prosperity and did not put investment into building the necessary homes.  What can be done now? Yesterday, our colleague, Senator Moynihan, in the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage asked the RTB if it could alert local authorities to renters in receipt of housing assistance payment, HAP, or rental accommodation scheme, RAS, so those individuals could be prioritised for the tenant  I raised this last week and the Taoiseach told me the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage was examining the matter of the tenant 	spk_74

It is an indication of the increasing desperation of many families and individuals who cannot find a secure home. That is the problem the Government needs to address.

I have corresponded with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, on the specific issue of a crèche closure in my constituency. This closure is indicative of a much broader problem, namely, that there is a real shortage of childcare and crèche places for families throughout the country. I was contacted by a family last week who were shocked to discover that their local childcare facility has a waiting list of in excess of 400. In the mums' WhatsApp group, the mother involved was advised that she should have reserved her child's place before she was 12 weeks' pregnant if she wanted to secure a spot in the facility. This situation indicates the severe shortage of childcare facilities across the country. Will the changes being introduced by Government, which we have welcomed as they move us towards a more secure and publicly funded service, lead to a guaranteed preschool place for every child? Will we see the sort of equal approach to early years childcare that Labour has been advocating for so long?	spk_120

I am looking at the Taoiseach and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, because I did also acknowledge the steps the Minister has taken towards building that model and the provision of core funding. I want to ask about one specific aspect. Last week, the Taoiseach said that the budget will support a reduction of 25% in childcare fees for parents. In reality, however, and certainly in Dublin, it looks as if the fee reduction parents are likely to see next year will not come close to 25%. Fees in Dublin are significantly higher than the national average. Parents in my constituency are paying as much as €1,000 per month per child. Many parents are unable to access childcare places.

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-11-24	dail	33	Abuse at Certain Educational Institutions: Statements	dbsect_30	"I welcome this important debate which I sought last week from the Taoiseach following the broadcast of the powerful ""Blackrock Boys"" radio documentary. I commend the immense courage of those who have come forward in recent weeks to disclose abuse that they suffered at Blackrock College, in the other five schools run by the Spiritans, and in other schools too. I acknowledge the horror of the abuse perpetrated upon children in this way and the immense harm caused to survivors, their families and communities as a result. I stress the importance of the Garda continuing to investigate where alleged perpetrators are still alive.Last week, the Spiritans issued a public apology to victims and announced the initiation of a restorative justice process. It is welcome to see this constructive engagement given restorative justice is a non-adversarial, victim-centred approach, but it requires acknowledgment of wrongdoing as a pre-requisite for participation by the offender or institution. Given the tone of correspondence I have received from the Spiritan Education Trust in recent days following my comments in this House last week, I have concerns about whether sufficient acknowledgement will be forthcoming. Indeed, in the past, institutions and religious orders have failed to offer sufficient acknowledgment of wrongdoing. In any case, while I think we are all conscious that restorative justice can be a welcome process, it is clearly also necessary that an independent inquiry be established to run in parallel. It is welcome that the Minister for Education and the Government have committed to establishing an inquiry and to hear she has started meeting survivors, meetings which I have heard from survivors have been very constructive. It is also welcome to hear she is engaging with Opposition party spokespersons and Deputy Ó Ríordáin, our party's education spokesperson, will engage on this with her and other party spokespersons next week. All of us are agreed that the first principle in establishing the inquiry should that it be survivor led and, therefore, meaningful consultation with survivors must take place before any final decision on the format of the inquiry can be made. Even so, a few points can be accepted by everyone, because whatever format is accepted or adopted, an inquiry should be capable of going beyond the six schools run by the Spiritans. If necessary, a modular format could be adopted to ensure an overall framework for the inquiry can be established for the Spiritan schools, on which the focus is currently placed, but that framework could be adapted to cover other institutions because we are all conscious that others have come forward in recent days to disclose abuse perpetrated in institutions that have not yet been the subject of any State inquiry. Such a framework could seek to review the extent of abuse perpetrated in each institution, building on previous reports published by, for example, the national safeguarding board. The framework should look at the existing culture of impunity, of turning a blind eye and of institutional cover-ups within specific religious orders. Crucially, a State inquiry should examine what the State could and should have done to prevent such abuse. In the context of the Spiritans in particular, as I said last week, any inquiry must address issues relating to the knowledge of those who are still in key decision-making roles at Blackrock College. We are all conscious that while systems have changed and both Ministers outlined those welcome improvements in child protection, key personnel may well be still in place despite the system changes and that has to be addressed by any inquiry. I greatly appreciate the engagement I have had from survivors in recent days. Those who have contacted me want to see all these issues addressed. They want to see significant and robust outcomes as a result of any inquiry and cultural change in various institutions and orders and, crucially, they want to ensure no other children will ever have to endure such horrific abuse. Turning to the format of the inquiry, for survivors it is about seeing outcomes. I acknowledge the Minister, Deputy Foley, will engage with survivors and that we cannot decide on the format of the inquiry until that engagement has taken place. Nevertheless, on reviewing the experience of inquiries and speaking from experience having represented the survivors of abuse in industrial schools before the residential institutions redress board, I offer the following observations about this format of inquiry. As the Minister noted, we should learn from pre-existing reports. Shamefully, these recent disclosures follow a long line of disclosures relating to the abuse of children in various institutions. Next year will see the 30th anniversary of the Kilkenny incest investigation report. I believe that, in total, 17 reports into child abuse in different settings have been produced since 1993, and we can learn from them. Second, as we know from experience, such as in the Ryan report process, statutory inquiries can be protracted and lengthy, but they come with significant powers of compellability. Some statutory inquiries, such as the Dublin and Cloyne reports, were much more swiftly carried out. While a non-statutory inquiry may have weaker powers, those powers may not be needed where an order or institution is fully co-operative. The Ferns inquiry, which was swiftly conducted, was a non-statutory inquiry and there are certain advantages to that. Finally, whatever format is adopted, clearly it should not in any way preclude live Garda investigations. I again express my gratitude and appreciation to the many survivors who have come forward to me and others in recent days and who have expressed their wish to see specific outcomes from an independent inquiry. We look forward to engaging with the Minister on the shape of that inquiry."	spk_285
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-11-23	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_10	I wish to again raise with the Taoiseach the housing crisis, which is a housing emergency, despite the Government's failure and refusal to declare it as such. In the lead-up to the important Raise the Roof rally on Saturday, which we in the Labour Party will support, along with many others in opposition, I wish to raise the real-world effects of this housing emergency in my constituency. On Rathmines Road, in Dublin Bay South, tenants in 20 apartments across two houses are facing eviction. Many of them are paying in excess of €1,000 or €1,200 a month for a single-bedroom apartment. Some of them have lived there for more than ten years, while others have been there for 20 years. They are now facing eviction. Despite the Tyrrelstown agreement ruling, which apparently seeks to restrict mass evictions of this nature, the company that owns the property is using what can only be described as a legal loophole in section 35A of the Residential Tenancies Act to take these families' and individuals' homes away from them. Why? Because the company says the sale of the property would drop by 20% of its market value were the tenants kept in place and the landlord would endure undue hardship if that were the case. According to reports, the landlord in this case owns 70 apartments across the city and the most recent figures available show the company owned, in total, more than €20 million of investment property in 2019 - undue hardship indeed. Not too far away from Rathmines, more than 100 residents in Tathony House, Kilmainham, Dublin 8 have been served an eviction notice. Again, the landlord there has invoked section 35A.  We need to secure greater protection for renters in these situations. We need to ensure undue hardship for those who are renting - the families who are going to be put out of their homes as a result of these evictions - is what is prioritised in our laws, not the undue hardship provision for landlords. A home should not be a commodity. Yesterday, the Taoiseach complained in the House that the Opposition is not providing constructive solutions and proposals to address the housing emergency. That is simply not the case for us in the Labour Party. In recent weeks, my colleague, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, our housing spokesperson, suggested the imposition of an eviction ban, which is now Government policy. We also suggested revising the income thresholds for social housing eligibility. Again, that is now Government policy. We suggested a vacant homes tax. Although it has been watered down, it is welcome to see that it is now Government policy. This progress is welcome but I will offer two more constructive proposals. First, to protect vulnerable renters such as those in Rathmines and Kilmainham, will the Government take on the Labour Party’s Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill 2021 that we put before this House a year ago and which passed Second Stage without opposition from Government? It would give tenants better protections. Second, as I asked yesterday, will the Government use the term of the winter eviction ban to fund and strengthen the tenant	spk_57

All Deputies will want to share their thoughts and sympathies with them and their families. Each week brings more news of the Government’s failure on housing policy. Today in particular we see news about failed policy in regard to renters, with a report from Daft.ie showing that rents rose by 14% year on year and a record 4.3% increase between June and September this year. Rents in Dublin, including my own constituency, are now more than €2,200 per month on average. In Longford, Leitrim and Cavan rents rose by a staggering 20%. We are seeing that this is a widespread phenomenon.We see rising rents and unaffordable homes for people. Increasingly, I know all of us are hearing, as I am, stories from those seeking to rent who are simply unable to secure affordable accommodation. One student told me at the weekend of spending five months looking in Dublin for somewhere suitable to rent and is now paying €1,200 per month for one room in a shared house with a shared, communal bathroom facility. Another constituent told me that upon contacting her landlord to request necessary plumbing and heating repairs, she was then issued with a notice to quit because her landlord was selling her home. The Government’s very welcome U-turn on a temporary eviction ban means she will not be without a home this Christmas, but the notion that a landlord could even threaten someone with eviction merely for requesting necessary repairs to their home is an indictment of our housing system. Some of the stories I hear all of the time from constituents about their difficulties with securing housing are stories we might expect from a Seán O’Casey play, not from a wealthy, prosperous European capital city in the 21st century. It is again an indictment of Government failings. I urge everyone to come out this Saturday, 26 November, for the Raise the Roof rally in Parnell Square, which we in the Labour Party and those across the Opposition are supporting. We know that policies are failing, that people are left without homes and that 11,000 people registered homeless last month. We see trade unions representing those in the education system saying the housing crisis is jeopardising education because teachers cannot afford homes and students at third level cannot afford to rent close to where they are going to college. I ask the Taoiseach to commit to spending the time that has been bought through the winter eviction ban to ensure the reduction of red tape to facilitate the purchase of properties by local authorities, so at least we will see the tenant 	spk_27

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-11-22	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_5	Over decades, we have seen neglect of national childcare policies, producing a piecemeal system with the highest proportion of private providers in the OECD and childcare costs continuing to rise. Despite the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme and core funding model, parents in Dublin are still paying as much as €1,000 per child per month, if they can find a crèche place. We know providers are closing crèches because many are also struggling and skilled early-years educators are still not being paid enough, despite the welcome changes with the employment regulation order. We are failing parents, staff, providers and, most of all, children by failing to deliver a proper, State-funded, universal childcare scheme. The Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality called for Ireland to move to a publicly-funded, accessible and regulated model of affordable early-years childcare over the next decade. We are working on the recommendations of the citizens' assembly but we are conscious the clock is ticking and we are one tenth of the way through that decade. The Government must take action now to ensure, by 2030, we move to the model of childcare to which the citizens' assembly aspired.	spk_65

At that one school alone, we are now learning of the horrific scale of the abuse that was perpetrated. It was revealed yesterday that 25 of the 120 boys in the class of 1979 have reported abuse. That is a staggering 21%. We know that 300 individuals have come forward disclosing abuse perpetrated upon them, and yet just three of the 77 Spiritans with allegations against them have criminal convictions. The scale of this is staggering.Deputy Ó Ríordáin, others from the Labour Party and I have been in contact with many of the survivors who have come forward. I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment, in response to my question on Tuesday, that we will have a debate on this matter in the House next week. This is welcome. I also welcome the apology from the Spiritans announced yesterday morning, as well as the announcement that the order will establish an independent process to provide a forum for survivors of abuse to come forward. I salute, as we all do, the bravery of those individuals who have already come forward and made public disclosures. Their courage in doing so has enabled others to step forward too. We believe, however, that we still need to see an independent inquiry take place, not only to uncover the extent of the abuse perpetrated not just by the Spiritans within one school, but, as it now seems, by other orders in other schools that have not yet been the subject of an inquiry and that have not yet, necessarily, come into the public domain. We have seen other schools named today. We also know that such an inquiry must be survivor-led. It must seek to review the extent of the abuse and, crucially, the existence of institutional cover-ups in individual schools and by particular orders. It should also seek to examine the role of the State and, in particular, its failures and what it could and should have done to prevent abuse in schools where the teachers were paid by the State and the schools were receiving significant public funding. We are all very conscious of the complexity of establishing such an inquiry. It may, for example, need to be done in a modular fashion. Clearly, we need to hear more from survivors. I welcomed the Taoiseach's indication that he would meet with survivors. We must also consider current concerns. I spoke yesterday about current issues and a person against whom serious allegations of abuse have been made and who continues to live on the grounds of Blackrock College. I am not going to name the individual. The matter is with the Garda, as it should be. The reality is that this is not just an historical issue. Not only are perpetrators still living who have evaded any sort of sanctions to date, but there are those currently in leadership roles in particular schools who have been in those posts for so long, many decades in some cases, that it is very difficult to believe they did not have knowledge of the abuse that was being perpetrated there. In advance of next week's debate, therefore, what preliminary thoughts does the Tánaiste and his Government have on how this matter can be investigated by the State?	spk_162

I endorse his comments and his encouragement of anyone who has been the victim of sexual abuse, in school or elsewhere, to report that matter to the Garda. I would also be glad to engage constructively with the Tánaiste and the Government on the structure of an inquiry. Survivors have contacted me to express their view that an inquiry and a process should engage, in particular, in ensuring that safeguards will be put in place to ensure that abuse like this will not happen in the future, cultural changes that will have to be made in different institutions, radical changes in systems of governance and, crucially, supports for survivors and victims. I look forward to a further debate on that. I stress again that this is not just an historical issue. People are still currently in leadership roles, in particular in Blackrock College, who have had continuous ongoing involvement with that college for 40 years. I am well aware that one individual, currently in a key leadership role, was told of specific abuse allegations in 2002 and has in the past decade been approached by other survivors who have been told by him to go away and not return unless they have proof and a solicitor with them. These are current issues and not just historical ones, and survivors do want to see them addressed by us as legislators and by the State.	spk_164

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-11-16	dail	33	Energy Regulations: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]	dbsect_10	I am glad to speak on this motion. We are aware that energy prices have risen across Europe. That is not in question, but there are particular factors at play in Ireland. Bloomberg is reporting that the biggest monthly gains in electricity costs are in Dublin, where power rates have climbed by 44%. Similarly, the costs of gas and other fuels are going up and up. We can no doubt attribute this anomaly to climate change. While the current unseasonably warm weather has a sinister cause, it has been positive in that fewer people in Ireland have had to turn on the heating so far. However, as we see a drop in temperature, even today, rising costs will have an even greater impact on households. We are all hearing already about the fear of many families and individuals as they face the winter ahead and see prices continuing to rise. On Saturday, I addressed a protest organised by the Cost of Living Coalition in Rathmines in my constituency. I spoke to students, older people, renters and many others. They described the increasingly narrow margins they experience to get by week after week. This is a genuine issue across the country. Undoubtedly, the terrible war being waged by Russia against Ukraine has had a significant effect on energy prices across Europe and worldwide. However, it feels as if we are being held to ransom here in Ireland by energy giants and market speculators. While households here are resilient and looking to where they can cut costs, and cut energy consumption with a climate focus, we can see it is not additional discretionary spending that drives hardship in Ireland; rather, it is the cost of basic necessities that does so. I include the costs of housing, rent, childcare and, of course, energy. Even though we all seek to reduce energy consumption, prices are still rising drastically. We are all hearing about these issues. There are many people who cannot manage without retaining their heating and energy-use levels. Vulnerability to market factors has contributed to the hardship people are in, and a change of system and radical measures are now needed to help, not the sort of Band-Aid solutions or half measures we saw introduced in budget 2023. While one-off measures such as the lump-sum payments assisted people for a while, their initial shine is starting to wear off. Once energy credits and lump-sum payments are used up, prices will continue to rise. Social protection recipients are receiving payments below the rate of inflation, and poverty and deprivation are likely to increase as temperatures drop. Therefore, it is past time that we saw an end to the undue deference to profit and profit-driven companies when it comes to securing the well-being of our people. A profit motive is fundamentally inconsistent with supporting people through periods such as this. We need to see a strengthening of the role of the State and the intervention of the State in the markets. To be constructive, what did we propose to avoid some of these problems and reduce reliance on the private sector and the market? Labour, in the budget, would have implemented a three-pronged approach to the energy crisis, with a windfall tax on excess profits, a cap on energy prices and changes to the fuel allowance and other energy supports. We have no hesitation in pushing further for the principle of a windfall tax on profits and a solidarity tax. We conservatively estimated that our iteration of a windfall levy would yield €600 million in 2022, rising to €800 million in 2023. The cap on energy prices has been resisted by the Government, which has said it is a complex and dynamic measure. It certainly is but we have seen many EU countries taking this approach. We pushed for the so-called Iberian model, introduced by socialist governments in Spain and Portugal. It has provided a model for limiting the price of gas and electricity production and, in effect, subsidising gas generators. Spain and Portugal have adopted that model since June and have reduced bills for Spanish and Portuguese households by between 15% and 20%. We have called for the temporary nationalisation of the Corrib gas field. I renew that call today in order that the price we pay for our domestic gas supply will be set at the cost of production, plus a margin for the operator, rather than having it set by the international market as at present. This does not entail a cap on fuel prices but such a measure would serve to regulate and reduce the cost for households. It can be achieved using existing legislation. As I have stated repeatedly in the House, this legislation was invoked by previous Governments in the 1970s during the fuel crisis. Alongside these measures, we would have put in place a range of targeted supports through budget 2023 to help cover the costs of the over 1 million households we know to be at risk of energy poverty. We would have created a refundable carbon tax credit targeted at ordinary working families in poorly insulated homes, and we would also have ensured that the credit would be worth €800 in total to low- and middle-income workers. Particularly for families who remain reliant on solid fuel and home heating oil in advance of retrofitting measures, this would have made a significant difference. It is hard to escape the conclusion, without these targeted measures, that a mini budget may well be required in the new year to account for the increasing inflation rate and increasing prices, particularly of energy and fuel. At the very least, the Government could have taken other measures that might have avoided that necessity. An example would be a clawback mechanism of some sort for our existing system of energy credits, such as the withdrawal of income tax credits from those earning €100,000, which we also called for. Another example would involve the application of a levy equivalent to the electricity credit, modelled on the previous non-principal private residence charge, to holiday and vacant homes to prevent those with multiple properties from benefiting from universal measures. We in Labour staunchly advocate universal measures, where necessary and of benefit, but this is a situation where targeting should have taken place. No one should benefit disproportionately when some are suffering so disproportionately. When I speak to individuals and groups who are disproportionately harmed, I want to restate our call for more effective reliefs for people who consume energy on a pay-as-you-go basis. We are all conscious that they are particularly affected. People on lower incomes are overrepresented in this group and are least insulated from price hikes. As with the eviction Bill, there should be a guarantee set in stone so no one’s lights or power will be switched off because they cannot afford to pay this winter. Another group struggling this winter and from whom I have heard in many cases comprises those in district heating schemes. The Minister will know that this group pays for energy at the commercial rate. I heard from an individual in my constituency whose bill has risen by nearly 600%, which is an extraordinary price hike. I am aware that there are others living in hundreds of apartment blocks around the country who are also affected. I submitted a parliamentary question very recently on this. In response, the Minister mentioned a steering group that is to report on the matter. This is an unsatisfactory response for those facing bills of in excess of €1,000 this winter. We need to see more urgent action taken. We are also calling on the Government to examine, as a matter of urgency, the regulation of energy companies' use of standing charges to offset the artificial price reduction brought about by the energy credit scheme. We know some suppliers are now charging nearly €1,000 per year in standing charges regardless of how much energy households or businesses use. Hiking charges is anathema to the message we should be sending, considering that we are asking people to reduce their use of unnecessary energy and switch to renewable sources. Therefore, I ask the Minister to revisit the Government’s decision on this. All of this comes against a backdrop of increasingly visible effects of climate change, on which there is an ongoing debate at COP27 in Egypt, yet Ireland still has what are among the highest emissions per person. Our system remains highly reliant on fossil fuel energy, so we need to see radical measures introduced to ensure a move to renewables and the ramping up of actions necessary to combat climate change.I look forward to continuing that aspect of the debate during the debate on the new climate action plan.	spk_31

Our condolences also go to all of the 221+ group, Lorraine Walsh, Stephen Teap and to many others, to Vicky's friends and to our own colleague, Deputy Kelly, who was a very close friend of Vicky's. Vicky bravely raised her voice. She decided to fight a system that had failed her. As we all know and as is acknowledged today, her activism prompted such a chain reaction that changed Irish society and that changed things for the better for so many women particularly in our health system. Today I am remembering, as we all are, many of those other activists who also fought for women's health alongside Vicky and who have sadly died, namely, Ruth Morrissey, Emma Mhic Mhathúna, Lynsey Bennett and Laura Brennan. Vicky’s contribution, like theirs, cannot be understated. Since Vicky spoke up in 2018, the number of women going for screening in Ireland has continued to increase. Free smear tests have become available in the wake of the controversy but of course more is needed. The reforms that Vicky and others prompted must continue, the Scally report must be implemented in full and we must see the actions that Vicky so eloquently called for being implemented in full. She was an inspiration to us all, but it is our responsibility to ensure that her legacy does more than just inspire us and that it feeds further into more actions that need to be taken.

The Taoiseach is welcome back from COP27. Yesterday, I welcomed that he was attending COP27 and that the Government was represented there by him. I called for more urgent action here at home to tackle the climate catastrophe. I think it has been promised that we will have a debate on COP27 in the next week or so. I look forward to hearing more about that then. I turn to the plight of the 3,000 people in Ireland, many of whom live and work in my constituency, who are employed by Facebook or its parent company, Meta, and currently do not know whether they will be in a job in a few weeks' time. We heard this morning from Facebook that it plans to make 13% of its global workforce redundant. That could mean as many as 390 people being made redundant here. That is a devastating prospect for so many people. It does not just apply to those employed by Facebook because this news follows a spate of lay-offs. There have been announcements from Twitter and Stripe. From news today, we know Zendesk is considering downsizing and Intel is considering job cuts. There are many thousands of people employed by tech and related companies in Ireland. Not all will be directly affected but many are in fear as they face this appalling prospect of losing their job. In a grim irony, many are discovering their fate in real time through a drip-feed of coverage on the same social media sites that are now threatening to take away their livelihoods. The news about job losses was broken to many Twitter employees when they were suddenly locked out of their email accounts in their workplaces. That is no way to treat humans. It is no way to show any sort of dignity and respect to those who are highly skilled, highly qualified and working in what we might call high-value sectors. However, we know job losses in high-value sectors can also have knock-on effects on low-paid sectors. In Ireland, we have seen chronic conditions for low-paid workers over many years and many of those working in these sectors will also fear the knock-on effect. I am asking that the Taoiseach and his Government call for much stronger rights for workers. We need to ensure, for example, that we see collective bargaining as a right and collective bargaining in the workplace because many of these tech companies are stridently anti-union. The workers are not organised within the workplaces in these high-value sectors. The lack of representation and collective solidarity may well have an impact now on the sort of redundancy packages we are going to see offered. We also need to see leadership from the Government on improvements to collective redundancy legislation in the event of liquidation. Clearly, that is not the issue today with the tech companies but it is a scenario that devastatingly arose for Debenhams workers two and a half years ago. We still have not seen delivery of the promise to improve collective redundancy rights in the event of liquidation. Will the Taoiseach guarantee strengthened collective bargaining and workers' rights in the face of these lay-offs and projected lay-offs?	spk_114

I know of friends, neighbours and constituents who are in a situation where two partners are both working for tech companies. They have massive mortgages and enormous childcare fees.

I absolutely accept there has been enormous expansion in the sector, supported by State investment. Let us not forget that.

It is very important that he is representing Ireland at COP27 in Egypt today because it is vital that we see really strong leadership at national and international level on tackling the climate catastrophe. As COP has got under way, we have been hearing increasingly bleak prognoses from world leaders. We heard António Guterres, UN Secretary General, say we are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator. He is not mincing his words, nor is our former President, Mary Robinson, in her strong warnings this morning on radio urging far more rapid and urgent implementation of promised measures here and internationally. While world leaders have committed previously to keep global warming below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, far from achieving that we are on track to reach a 2.8°C rise by the end of the century, and eight of the ten hottest years on record have occurred in the past decade. If we miss our global warming targets, we will not have to wait long to see the consequences. We are already seeing them now, with devastating floods in Pakistan, the devastating famine encroaching on the Horn of Africa, the drought there and the excessive heatwaves in Europe. Here in Ireland, on a balmy, sunny November afternoon, we can see the consequences of climate change ourselves with the bizarre environmental impacts on our plant life, with real risks to our biodiversity and with unthinkable things happening in our environment and in agriculture.The things we take for granted, like having land that is capable of food production, are now at real risk. We watched lots of horror movies during the Halloween season but I can think of nothing more scary than the immediate future facing us with this imminent climate catastrophe. The failure to take international action has generated cynicism among many activists, included Greta Thunberg, but the COP process is the only game in town. It is the only international forum where we can see world leaders come together to try to achieve change, even at this late date. The Labour Party believes in the power of that forum to take the necessary collective action but we need to see a resolve from our own leaders that is commensurate with the challenge. In particular, we need to see the Taoiseach stepping up along with the Minister and the rest of the Government to ensure we do not just set ambitious but necessary targets but deliver on the measures needed to reach those targets. We are just over seven years away from the 2030 deadline. With the best and most constructive will in the world, it is impossible for many of us to see how we are going to reach our target of a 51% cut by 2030. We have missed targets, rising emissions, low investment in critical infrastructure and significant delays in generation of offshore wind capacity. Ireland is the second highest emitter of greenhouse gases per head of population in the EU so we need to see more urgent action. Will the Taoiseach show a commitment to the polluter pays principle so that those paying the highest price for climate change will see justice? Will he sign up to and promote the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty while he represents us at COP27 this week?	spk_12

The Minister also spoke of the climate action plan 2023 and said it will go to the Government shortly. When is that going to come before this House? I ask because we have previously seen foot-dragging and delays in the production of necessary plans and in the development of the sectoral emissions targets. Often, these have not been brought before this House and the other House until very late in the day and at a time when we cannot give the plans the sort of adequate scrutiny required. I was glad to hear the Minister speak of the Taoiseach's commitment to ensuring a solidarity pact with the Global South. This is hugely important.

Even a month on, it is still unbelievable for all of us to recall just how suddenly and brutally ten lives were lost on that day. The names of those who perished have been read into the Dáil record. Those lives lost were James O'Flaherty, Jessica Gallagher, Martin McGill, Catherine O'Donnell, James Monaghan, Hugh Kelly, Leona Harper, Martina Martin, Robert Garwe and Shauna Flanagan-Garwe. Many other lives were severely affected, many others were badly injured and many families will carry the wounds of the explosion and the disaster for years to come. Like others, I pay tribute to the emergency services, the heroic first responders and the volunteers and professionals who did so much in the immediate aftermath of the explosion and in the days and weeks since. Clearly, however, the hurt and pain and the loss caused will be with the area long after the physical debris is removed and the physical damage repaired or demolished, even after survivors have been physically healed. We are all conscious that the Garda investigation into what exactly happened is still ongoing. We have seen experts from the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, Analysis Service and Technical Bureau involved. I understand that a specialist company from outside Ireland has been hired to assist. It is good to see such collaboration and interagency work.I am sure all of us want to urge a speedy resolution. Hopefully, some answers will be forthcoming that may provide some sense of why this happened to those so badly affected. Even definitive conclusions cannot help address the trauma of such a random explosion that robbed so many people of their futures - women, men and children. The question of ""what if?"" may always be there in the back of all our minds. The one thing that may come out of any report of the investigation is that there might be recommendations that could be applied to prevent similar terrible events or incidents reoccurring.  As the glare of public attention moves on and the families and the community deal with their grief and loss in the privacy so many are seeking, we must ensure the community receives all the assistance necessary to recover as best it can and to rebuild some of what was lost. Ongoing mental health and counselling supports and resourcing for communities will be needed. Healing can take place in a number of other ways. We have seen reports of joy like the local St. Michael's GAA u-13 side winning the division 2 cup final last Sunday week, which gave people in the area a much-needed lift. We have also seen enormous generosity from people here and around the world with significant resources and support funds collected. Undoubtedly, public investment in the community will be needed to help people find positive ways forward.  The strength of the local community has been severely tested but it has shown its collective meitheal in the days and weeks since the terrible explosion. In the months and years ahead, we must ensure that the families affected and the local community continue to be supported and to receive any necessary State and public supports in recognition of their needs.  The loss so suddenly of so many loved ones on such a scale has been unprecedented in our country in recent years. As we enter the dark days of winter, our thoughts, sympathies and solidarity will remain with the people of Creeslough as they continue to live with the aftermath of this terrible tragedy."	spk_89

We are less than 12 hours away from the looming deadline in Northern Ireland where it appears that yet another election will be called. The people of Northern Ireland have been left without a functioning Executive for six months as we approach a deepened winter cost-of-living crisis and as we see significant issues around governance and day-to-day administration that need to be resolved but cannot be resolved without a functioning Administration in the North. There was a deeply worrying report today of Ukrainian refugees being targeted by gangs in the North who are exploiting the political stalemate and the Border to bring refugees into human trafficking and the brutal exploitation of the sex trade, while there is a £90 million funding shortage for the PSNI that needs to be resolved to ensure this can be policed. As we speak, Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly are gathering in Stormont to try to elect a Speaker and get on with the job of governing, but it appears that nothing will change the current position of the DUP, which will maintain its veto, and so it seems the stark reality is that the British Government will call an election at five minutes past midnight. As Claire Hanna MP from our sister party, the SDLP, said this morning on RTÉ, an election called in this way and under such duress is unlikely to change much and may even entrench stalemate and delay any return to normal negotiations between the EU 27 and the British Government on seeking to resolve issues with the protocol. If no Executive is formed, we know there will not be a return to the direct rule of the past, so how will democratic institutions be restored? The assembly has not had a functioning Executive for four out of the past six years due to intransigence on the part of different parties, so it must be time to look at reform. Since the changes resulting from the St. Andrews Agreement, the largest party in either designated community can in effect use a veto against the formation of a power-sharing Executive. The use of that veto has entrenched division, hollowed out the centre ground parties and resulted in more voters opting for unaligned alternatives, as we saw in the most recent Stormont election, yet the current structures take no account of the rise of support for parties that do not designate as either unionist or nationalist. It is deeply damaging to efforts to normalise politics in the North when either of the two largest parties can veto power-sharing. It appears the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the British Government do not have a plan B for what will happen after the likely election in mid-December in the North. We will be no closer to an Executive. The election is unlikely to change the position of the DUP. We are approaching the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement with the principles at the heart of it that are so crucial on consent and partnership, and yet there is no functioning Executive. Is it time to consider reforms that would allow those parties that are willing and ready to form an Executive to carry on with their work? Is there a plan B for the Irish Government to ensure that, after a likely election is held, we can see necessary reforms put in place in keeping with the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement to ensure a functioning Administration in the North?	spk_213

He stated clearly the Government position that there is no need for a new election. I agree entirely. All of us in this House would agree. The last Stormont election was just 24 weeks ago. Clearly, there are very pressing issues affecting the people in Northern Ireland every day, particularly with the cost-of-living crisis, and they need a functioning Executive and a functioning assembly to resolve those issues. Given we are facing a last chance today to resolve the matter without the calling of another election by the British Government, I am asking what our Government's plan B is. If an election is announced at five minutes past midnight, as seems likely despite everyone's wishes here, it is unlikely to change the dynamics in the North. Is it not now time to look again at how we can reform the governance arrangements in the North in keeping with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement to ensure there will be functioning democratic institutions in the North and the will of the people as expressed through assembly elections can be carried out through functioning democratic institutions? I am suggesting to the Tánaiste that no party should be excluded from power-sharing in that scenario, that every party should be given the option to take part, and that it is undemocratic to allow one party to take a unilateral decision to veto power-sharing and hold all others in Northern Ireland to ransom.	spk_215

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-10-26	dail	33	Development (Emergency Electricity Generation) Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_19	"I welcome the opportunity to speak for the Labour Party on this Bill. I join with Deputy O'Rourke in expressing frustration at the truncated nature of the debate and the fact that it is all being compressed into such a short timeframe.It was particularly regrettable that the Minister of State did not get to finish his speech on the record but it is also frustrating for Opposition Deputies to be given such a short and tight timeframe in which to submit amendments and deal with legislation on such an important issue as the energy crisis. The nature of the Bill and its content raise serious questions about failures in Government energy policy and the circumstances that have led us to the point where we need to pass the second item of emergency legislation this year in order to secure energy supplies, not even in the long-term future but the immediate future. It raises questions about how we can achieve the necessary steps to ensure we make the transition to renewable energy sources and a net zero future. It is a source of frustration to all of us that we are in this position again. We have had emergency legislation already this year in this context. We passed the EirGrid Bill before the summer. We represented a responsible approach in Opposition and Deputy O'Rourke has expressed that well. This issue should and could have been addressed then and the concern is we may be back here again in another few months' time for another emergency Bill if longer-term issues are not addressed. The briefing note provided to us says all potential options under conventional planning processes have been ruled out as they would not enable delivery within the limited timeframe. That begs the question as to why things are being done in such a time-compressed manner. We are told this is coming within the framework of the exceptional cases provisions of Article 2(4) of the EIA directive. We also legislated for exceptional cases in the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act 2022, passed in a rush this summer. As we have seen with the Derrybrien wind farm, failure to comply with EU environmental laws can have serious consequences. It is concerning that the State appears to be reliant on these exceptional mechanisms to ensure security of supply for the winter ahead. The situation is a result of a flawed and failed electricity supply market. When markets fail, we accept it is incumbent on the State to step in but it should happen in a more structured and strategic way, rather than through last-minute legislation. I think everyone would accept that, including the Government. This Bill will allow for the installation of up to 450 MW and associated works at Shannonbridge and Tarbert generating stations. It also provides for a broadening clause to open up its provision for other suitable or appropriate sites. The new generators will be installed in the sites specified in the Bill but will the Minister of State indicate what criteria would apply for other sites to be deemed appropriate? On what basis would they be deemed appropriate? A number of my colleagues have tabled an amendment to delete the clause ""or at alternative appropriate sites"" in section 2. We in Labour will support that amendment unless we hear a compelling reason for that clause. There is another matter of EU law it is important for the Minister of State to clarify. The central thrust of the Bill is to disapply the Planning and Development Acts and substitute a ministerial approval process for the development, on a temporary and emergency basis, of electricity generation to be in place for winter 2023-24, rather than this coming winter. I understand a roughly similar approach was adopted on a non-temporary basis under Part 4 of the Prisons Act 2007 in relation to the construction of new prisons. A key difference in that scheme was the requirement for resolutions to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas as a final step in the approval process. That is an important check and balance. I have tabled an amendment to provide for such an resolution to be passed in the Oireachtas for this case as well. I hope the Minister of State takes that on board. For such extraordinary emergency powers to bypass planning requirements, there might well be a specific approval provision on a case-by-case basis by the Oireachtas, where the Minister would have to address key climate metrics in each case. We will come to that amendment shortly, given the shortened timeframe, but I wanted to put the rationale for it out on Second Stage. A key question I have for the Minister of State relates to the allocation and separation of responsibilities under EU law as between electricity generators and suppliers, on one hand, and the transmission system operator, EirGrid, on the other. It seems clear from the Bill that it is the intention that EirGrid be permitted or expected to apply for ministerial approval to carry out a ""development [consisting] of the installation of up to 450 megawatts of temporary emergency electricity generation plant, site development and works ancillary to that installation, and the operation of the plant"". However, our understanding has been that under EU law, EirGrid, as the independent transmission system operator, is not permitted to perform any function relating to electricity generation or supply. Will the Minister of State clarify why EirGrid is identified in the Bill as the applicant? Does this arise from the previous emergency legislation? Is our understanding correct or is some exception or derogation being relied upon in the current circumstances? In a related question, it is our understanding that for similar reasons, EirGrid would generally be prohibited from owning, developing, managing or operating an electricity storage facility, but we are aware an exception is provided for, subject to conditions designed to ensure the transmission system operator does not become a player in the electricity markets. We seek clarity on that. I think we all agree that the electricity sector has a central role to play in combating climate change. Clearly, achieving our emissions reduction targets will involve putting much more electricity from renewable sources on the grid, especially generation through using offshore wind capacity. I know Wind Energy Ireland briefed Oireachtas Members today on this. Where there is a great deal of potential wind power on an intermittent basis, the development of large-scale capacity to store excess electricity generated in this way and release it to meet demand will become crucial.  The promoters of the Silvermines Hydro 360 MW plant are expected to apply for full planning permission early next year, with delivery no sooner than 2028. There is a long lead-in for these projects and I am not aware of any other proposals promising delivery in a similar timeframe. Given this long lead-in, many commentators are convinced the engineering and logistical capacity to plan and deliver projects on the necessary scale within the necessary timeframes would be greatly enhanced by the active participation of the State sector, with the State and public sector supporting and providing additional capacity. There is a real and valid concern that private operators will not by themselves have capacity to provide the solutions needed soon enough. That is why we believe we need much more direct State intervention. The Government's policy statement of November last year acknowledged that one of the challenges to security of electricity supply is ensuring adequate storage capacity. It has specifically acknowledged the need for significant investment in additional storage capacity. What role do the Minister of State and Government foresee for EirGrid or the ESB in speeding up the deployment of clean energy by promoting a renewables-focused power system with a greatly improved energy storage capacity? Does the Minister of State envisage ensuring that derogations under EU law will be availed of, so as to enable the bank of engineering and logistical expertise in the commercial State sector to be brought into service in the national interest and ensure delivery of this urgent and demanding project? Our concern is it may well be a case of emergency legislation again to allow for fossil fuel-power generating capacity but without any sense of similar urgency for clean energy generated through renewables.  I am conscious we all have a much shorter timeframe than we might have liked. Will the Minister of State clarify in his wrap-up or on Committee Stage how it is intended that section 10 will allow the Minister to comply with the provisions of section 15 of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act when it is so broadly defined? What is the manner that would be consistent with section 15 when the legislation provides in the proposed section 10 an open-ended caveat stating ""to the extent that they consider practicable, taking particular account of the said exceptional circumstances and urgent and compelling necessity."" How does that align with the provisions of the climate action Act? We are all anxious to see Dermot McCarthy's review of energy security completed. I am sure the Government is also anxious to see that. Will the Minister of State update the House on the timeframe for that report? How will we go about seeing any recommendations in the report implemented in a more measured and structured way that will not mean we are back before the House in the coming months with yet more emergency legislation to guarantee energy security over this and coming winters?"	spk_240

Many of us in opposition have been pressing for that for some time. I also support the amendments put forward in this grouping. At their most basic, what they seek to do is to ensure that an effective eviction ban will be in place for longer because the longer we can uphold the eviction ban legally and within the terms of the Constitution and the more we can limit the scope of any exemptions to it, the more households we can keep out of homelessness. Given there are now more than 10,500 homeless individuals, of whom 3,000 are children, it is clearly long past time we sought to address the Government's failed policy of over-reliance on the private rental sector, which is the underlying cause of the housing crisis. The Bill, while welcome, represents only a part of the overall package of measures needed to address the more long-term issues. Like my colleagues, I am conscious that we have a shortened time in which to debate these amendments. The Labour Party has proposed amendments that seek to strengthen the protection for renters and limit the scope of exemptions to the eviction ban in the Bill. I am conscious we may not get to those amendments and I will not speak for long on this group of amendments because I want to ensure there is time for contributions on all the amendments. I support the amendments in this group. We are all conscious of the need to abide by the terms of the Constitution but nobody thinks the homelessness and housing crises will be addressed in the immediate term and, therefore, it makes sense to extend the timeframe for the application of the legislation. It would also give greater clarity to households and renters who are currently unclear about whether, and when, their notices to quit will take effect. The day after the Government made the announcement of its intention to introduce this legislation, I received correspondence, as many of us did, from renters in my constituency telling me it would give them breathing space. One renter told me that his family of three is facing a notice to quit that will take effect on 1 February. That notice to quit has been issued. He is hopeful that this legislation will provide him and his family with breathing space. Even with income available to them to pay up to €3,000 rent per month in the Dublin area, they simply cannot find any accommodation to rent. I know the Simon Community and others have pointed out the lack of any accommodation available in the Dublin area. There were 700 applications for one property my constituent sought to rent.As he said, it is Lotto odds to try to get accommodation to rent now in Dublin. The Labour Party put forward the Residential Tenancies (Tenants Rights) Bill which would have addressed some of the issues here on a more long-term basis, in seeking to ensure greater security of tenure, that enhanced supports are available for those renting, and to limit the scope of exemptions to ensure that tenants cannot be evicted for spurious reasons. The Minister did not oppose the Bill at that point and indicated that he would support some of the provisions in it. I appeal to him again to ensure more protections for renters and ask that he would support us in moving this Bill forward further. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.	spk_264

            (a) in the Table to section 34—(i) by deleting paragraph 3, and(ii) in paragraph 5, by substituting “, no reasonable measures can be taken to maintain the dwelling fit for human habitation during the refurbishment or renovation” for “in a way which requires the dwelling to be vacated for that purpose”,and(b) in section 35 by the substitution of the following for subsection (4):“(4) In paragraph 4 of the Table the reference to a member of the landlord’s family is a reference to—(a) a spouse or civil partner of the landlord, or(b) a child (including a stepchild, foster child or adopted child) of the landlord.”.”.The revised grouping seems to contain a huge number of amendments. I wish to speak in particular in support of the three amendments the Labour Party is putting forward, namely, amendments Nos. 3, 7 and 20. We are also supporting the amendments from other colleagues. The effect of our amendments would be to restrict the scope for no-fault evictions further. Amendment No. 3 would place a higher burden on the landlord to prove that there is no other way to renovate the property. We are conscious that the aim of this Bill is to ensure the scope of no-fault evictions will be limited beyond the temporary eviction ban. There should also be further restrictions on no-fault evictions. This is something we believe is essential in order to make the legislation more effective beyond the term in which the deferment is to take effect. I listened carefully to what the Minister said. I welcomed his comments about the tenant The amendments we are putting forward, Nos. 3, 7 and 20, as well as the other amendments, seek to strengthen the protections for renters and restrict the scope for no-fault evictions and to ensure no-fault evictions will not be able to take place even beyond the duration of the eviction ban that this legislation is going to put in place. Amendment No. 7, for example, would give effect to enhanced support for those in rent arrears, as recommended by Threshold, and would also limit evictions on the grounds of overcrowding. As my colleague, Deputy Ged Nash, said on Second Stage, it is clearly not ideal for people to live in overcrowded accommodation but we have to recognise the context of the housing crisis, or the housing disaster as our President has described it, and ensure we limit as far as possible any of the grounds for eviction. Beyond the temporary ban eviction, which is very welcome, and we welcome this Bill, we also want to strengthen protections for renters. We want to ensure we will not see no-fault evictions taking place. In other European countries, such evictions are heavily circumscribed. We want similar protections for renters built into our legislation to ensure more long-term protections."	spk_279

Clearly the central thrust of the Bill itself is to disapply the Planning and Development Acts and to substitute a ministerial approval process for the development on a temporary and emergency basis of electricity generation projects. We understand that a roughly similar approach was adopted on a non-temporary basis under Part 4 of the Prisons Act 2007 in relation to the construction of new prisons. The key difference in that scheme was the requirement that resolutions would be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas as a final step in the approval process. We have used that model and mechanism in proposing to insert a similar provision in section 7 of the Bill through our amendment No. 5, which provides:If the Minister proposes to approve a designated development, whether subject to conditions or otherwise, he or she shall before doing so move a draft resolution in both Houses of the Oireachtas ...This simply seeks to ensure more transparency is provided for in the process and there is democratic oversight of the ministerial approval process. In no way does it seek to undermine the Minister’s power to make an approval of this nature. It simply seeks to ensure there is adequate scrutiny. When we are debating Bills in such a truncated timeframe and on such an emergency basis, and given that this is the second emergency energy Bill we are being asked to debate and rush through this year, I think it is reasonable to require that there would be that level of democratic oversight within the provisions of this Bill."	spk_297

He referred us to section 7(1), but our concern in this regard is that a Minister is not required to take into account the assessments and conditions. Rather, it states ""The Minister may"". That is the basis for amendment No. 4, which would insert ""Subject to subsection (2), the Minister may"". We felt the legislation could be strengthened to give another layer of scrutiny in the decision-making process. We just want to ensure transparency within the process given that it is overriding normal processes in the interest of urgency and because there is an emergency. We accept all that. I take the Minister's point on public consultation and the sunset clause that we discussed on Second Stage but section 7(1) is somewhat weak and does not quite live up to the Minister's indication that the legislation ensures another layer of accountability within the process."	spk_300

It is fair to say that across Ireland, communities have been dismayed to see people fleeing the brutal war in Ukraine having to sleep on the floor in Dublin Airport. That is a matter of grave concern, dismay and distress to communities across Ireland that have been so generous in offering refuge to the thousands of people who have had to come here because of the brutal invasion of their democratic, sovereign homeland by Russia; by Putin and his brutal army. It is disappointing that there was not engagement back in the spring or earlier in the summer by the Government to ensure that we would have short-term, medium-term and long-term planning in place in order that this would not happen. Back in July, I hosted a briefing here in the Oireachtas with members of the Ukraine Civil Society Forum at which they called for that level of planning to be put in place, and at which they and members of the Ukrainian community here called for a co-ordinated whole-of-government response led by the Taoiseach. That is what is needed now.For too long, it seems, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has been left to bear almost full responsibility for the housing of and provision of support to those who come here fleeing war and to the communities here who are supporting them so generously and ably. That has not been good enough and that is why we are in the position we are in now. We in the Labour Party want to offer constructive support and engagement with the Taoiseach and the Government and that is why I wrote to him yesterday seeking that he would provide all Opposition leaders and spokespersons with a briefing on the current status of accommodation for those fleeing war in Ukraine and, indeed, those seeking international protection. I sought that briefing on the current situation but also sought a briefing on future planning. In the spring, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage wrote to us in the Opposition and asked us to supply him with details on vacant properties in our areas, and we sent details to his office. Through our party’s housing spokesperson, Senator Moynihan, we put forward a range of properties in our constituencies, including Baggot Street hospital in my area and other properties too. I have been engaging with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman's, Department, as have other colleagues. We have not heard back with updates on the properties we have proposed. We want to see local communities and local authorities be far more strongly engaged in this process. We want to see a whole-of-government approach and a ramping-up of efforts to unlock the capacity we know is here in this country. We have been very generous in our approach but across Europe we have seen generosity. The Czech Republic has taken in four times as many refugees from Ukraine per head of population as we have. We are seeing enormous efforts across Europe because European democracy is under threat. The Taoiseach is absolutely correct; Putin is weaponising refugee flows and we cannot let him win. That is why we need to ensure the Opposition and the Government are engaged together in this collective effort.	spk_34

I welcome that. It is very important that we ensure the strong political support is there across the spectrum and across Opposition and the Government. We have seen divisions being sown in other countries over this issue and it is really important we do not allow that to happen here. That is really commendable. I also thank the Taoiseach for engaging with me on the Baggot Street hospital site. I have also put forward other properties, however, as have my Labour Party colleagues. We await a Government response on that. It would be very welcome to have a process where we can feed in constructive proposals to address this, including the ramping up of modular housing. As the Taoiseach said, that does offer a way forward. It is good to hear about vacant State-owned properties that are being repurposed, which is very welcome. The Ukraine Civil Society Forum asked for better management and co-ordination, however, including communication with local authorities and communities and a proper structure to manage the response, monitor standards in welfare and facilitate all the offers of pledged accommodation. This should offer clear communication from the centre of Government and as the Taoiseach said, a clear sense that this issue is being addressed across all Departments to the same degree. That does not appear to be the case in the public perception. It is very important that we see leadership from the centre of Government.	spk_36

We know the meeting this week of European leaders, on 20 and 21 October, comes at a pivotal moment in the plans for tackling the energy emergency and cost-of-living crisis, as well as the ongoing response of Europe to Russia's brutal war against the people of Ukraine. What matters most to people, however, is the tangible proposals that emerge from the Council meeting and whether they will be implemented before winter. Last weekend, I had the opportunity to attend the annual congress of the Party of European Socialists in Berlin on behalf of the Labour Party. Among the addresses at the conference was that of German Chancellor Mr. Olaf Scholz, leader of the Social Democratic Party in Germany. He spoke in support of the accession of western Balkan states. I am glad the Taoiseach also spoke in support of the accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania. At the congress in Berlin, socialists and social democrats from across Europe gathered to discuss policies on energy, inflation, climate change and social challenges. I was privileged to meet with socialist prime ministers from the many countries across the EU who have already acted on energy prices. I was privileged and proud to address members on the need for stronger collective bargaining rights and on the issue of a pay rise for workers, as well as the need for collective action on energy prices. What I heard from leaders across Europe was about bold national actions being taken to reduce costs and tackle the energy crisis. Unfortunately, here in Ireland, we have seen much slower progress by the Government on policies in this area. For many months, we in the Labour Party have been arguing for a comprehensive response to energy crisis in Ireland, including the introduction of a windfall tax on energy profits, a cap on the price of energy modelled on the Iberian approach, and the temporary nationalisation of the Corrib gas field. Weeks on from the budget, despite the Tánaiste confirming to me in this House last week that a windfall tax would be introduced, we still have no sense of when that will happen or, indeed, what type of tax it will be. Will we have to rely on EU legislation for this tax or will provision be made for this in the Finance Bill? We have seen other member states take initiatives at national level and, therefore, we do not need to wait for an EU-wide initiative. As I mentioned, Spain and Portugal have already intervened. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez of Spain and Prime Minister Antonio Costa of Portugal, with whom I engaged at the weekend, are both socialist prime ministers who have intervened to ensure there is state regulation of dysfunctional gas and electricity markets. As socialists, they recognise that governments must act and intervene in the market to protect their people and they have saved billions of euro for their citizens by doing so. Their Iberian model of an energy cap has been the subject of intensive debate and interest in Europe over the past month, but it is still not clear if the EU will act or if something will come out of the European Council meeting later this week. I ask the Minister of State to speak to the Taoiseach and to confirm if Ireland will support the Spanish and Portuguese Iberian model introduced by our sister socialist parties. The actions of Spain and Portugal have shown the sort of proactive measures that socialists in government can and have taken to protect their citizens from the fallout of Putin's brutal war in Ukraine. We acknowledge that designing and costing an energy price cap is complex and that there are different ways to go about doing so, but we know that across this country households and businesses are suffering now and are fearful about the impact of the next energy bill upon their homes and businesses. Once-off payments and energy credits of the sort the Government has introduced will simply not be enough because businesses are closing and people are struggling to heat their homes and we have not even entered the real winter months yet. People cannot wait any longer for the EU to act and we are calling on the Government to intervene now in the gas and electricity market in Ireland. On the Council's deliberations on the war in Ukraine, it is good to hear the Taoiseach confirming strong solidarity across EU states in their opposition to Russia's brutal war and in their determination to give greater aid to Ukraine. I ask that Ireland commits to giving more financial aid to support civilian social programmes, including funds to support education, health and social welfare, and to support local communities in welcoming Ukrainian visitors to Ireland, alongside investment for Ukraine in rebuilding and recovering from the despicable attacks we have seen on ordinary people. I ask that the Council consider the escalatory attacks of Russia over the past week, assisted by Iranian-made drones. We have seen the targeting of energy infrastructure and civilian apartment complexes by Russia, which are blatant war crimes. In response to a question from Deputy Howlin in the Dáil last week, the Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed there are 26 officers at the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Ireland, 11 diplomats and 15 administrative and technical staff. What reason is there for 26 staff to be retained at the Russian Embassy here?We need to act and break off diplomatic relations with Russia. We are seeing horrific war crimes being committed and escalating reactions in the past week alone. Why can we not move to expel embassy staff? I welcomed the expulsion of some embassy staff earlier in the conflict, but let us move further to expel the other staff. At this point, we should flag the removal of our embassy from Russia. It should and must become an international pariah. I ask that stronger action be taken at EU level and here to express our outright condemnation of Russia's brutality and war crimes against Ukraine.	spk_236

It represents a real change since Thursday when I questioned the Tánaiste on it then. His response was rather lukewarm on the prospect of a temporary eviction ban. We welcome it but we have to remember that for nearly 11,000 individuals and 3,220 children who are homeless and without a secure home that ban will come too late. These figures will only continue to grow after the eviction ban has concluded unless the core problem of a lack of social and affordable homes is addressed because all of us know of so many families who are terrified of being evicted, who are in fear of being evicted or who have just been evicted. All morning we heard loud and clear the voice of property owners objecting to this ban but we have not directly heard the voices of those affected. One man from my constituency contacted me and he tells me that he is in fear of imminent eviction, he has already been given a notice to quit in the spring and even with a substantial income available to him, he cannot locate an alternative property. He said that one rental property had 700 applications and another had more than 500. He said that any type of extension to his eviction would be welcome as he needs time to locate a new place to live for his family of three. For individuals in that circumstance, including people who are working and people whose incomes may have been sufficient years ago to afford a reasonable rent, a supply of homes is no longer available. There is clearly a serious housing shortage for those on lower incomes and the winter eviction ban, while welcome, does not address that issue. As my colleague, our housing spokesperson, Senator Moynihan, said, there are three key measures we are calling on Government to implement to address the issues that will continue to arise for those families in fear of homelessness in the spring, after the ban has been lifted. First, we are asking Government to rapidly expand the tenant 	spk_11

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-10-18	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I wish to raise the plight of householders in the Carrickmines multi-unit development in south County Dublin. As we know, after the financial crash the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, took over the estate and became the developer through its appointed receiver. A range of defects became apparent in the development and while some remedial works were carried out, in 2017 the owners' management company, OMC, had a review carried out and there are still quite a number of identified issues and defects remaining. The OMC has refused to agree to a handover from the receiver of the development to its management due to these issues. We know a court case is due to take place next week with the receiver operating on behalf of NAMA taking the OMC to court. When will we see an effective scheme for redress for the many homeowners who through no fault of their own in Carrickmines and elsewhere now face massive bills for the costs associated with remedying defects that were left in developments? The finance Bill is to be published on Thursday. Will we see a redress scheme in that Bill for homeowners?	spk_93

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-10-18	dail	33	Domestic Electricity and Gas Disconnections: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_15	Labour welcomes this motion and I commend Deputy O’Rourke and his colleagues on bringing it forward. The principle is irrefutable: no one should be left unable to heat their home or run their fridge or other appliances because they cannot afford to pay. If there is consensus on that matter as we enter into this bleak winter ahead, then the Government has the task of examining every mechanism available to it to fulfil its responsibility to struggling households and families. The Government has to intervene in the market when the market is failing to ensure that people will have the security this winter that they need. The motion contains a variety of measures that may help. Many are policies that have been proposed by Labour and by many of us in opposition. The principle remains, however, that no one should go cold or hungry this winter because they are unable to pay. Yet, we know that at present the cost-of-living crisis and a real fear about rising energy bills are forcing many people to take impossible decisions between heating and eating, and putting so many individuals and households in fear. In June this year, ESRI data revealed that energy inflation had increased the number of households in energy poverty to 29%, the highest recorded rate, with a concern that this will increase further over the winter months. Within that study, there was certainly an acknowledgement that some of the measures that have been put in place, such as household electricity credits, can help to keep people out of energy poverty, but these measures are insufficient on their own and more targeted measures are also needed. As we have seen from the hike in standing charges, certain measures are needed to ensure that the credits are not absorbed by further price increases, which is the real concern. We often talk about the energy crisis and the cost-of-living crisis as short-term, immediate problems that have come upon us this year, exacerbated by Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine. Certainly, the brutal war that Russia is waging in Ukraine has exacerbated things.However, the effects of the crises are long lasting and their roots have existed for a long time, particularly the Government's failure to deliver a sufficient supply of housing. We welcome the winter eviction ban that was announced today. Indeed, the Minister of State welcomed it in advance of its announcement by the Government. Research published this week by the ESRI and Pobal showed a strong relationship between financial difficulties in childhood and adulthood. This is about the long-lasting effects of energy poverty and poverty more generally. According to the study, 39% of adults whose childhood circumstances were bad or very bad were materially deprived in 2019 compared with just 10% of those whose circumstances had been good or very good. Childhood financial circumstances influence later outcomes, suggesting that longer lasting supports are needed to mitigate the negative effects on health of poverty throughout life. School closures during the pandemic exacerbated pre-existing inequalities among children. It is imperative that we address the long-term impacts created by the cost-of-living crisis and the energy crisis. Stemming the effects of fuel poverty must be a serious imperative for the Government. Keeping families out of darkness is itself a targeted measure. I will address a number of the specific measures in the motion and elsewhere. I welcome the motion's provision on the introduction of a windfall tax. We in Labour have pushed for this for some time. I welcome the recent intervention by the Minister of State's Green Party colleague, Mr. Ciarán Cuffe, in the European Parliament when he called for the long-overdue introduction of such a measure at EU level. However, I question the Government's strategy of appearing to wait and see what happens in Europe. We could do more domestically. Labour led the way much earlier this year when calling for a windfall tax on the profits of energy companies to be introduced in this country. We could have taken action then and a measure could have been adopted that would have provided real help. Last week, I restated my frustration at the Government's insistence that it could not do anything nationally and was awaiting developments at EU level. In response to a question I tabled during Thursday's Leaders' Questions, it was welcome to hear the Tánaiste's apparent commitment to introducing a windfall tax. He certainly made reference to the Government's intention to introduce such a tax but could not give me any indication of the timeline of its introduction. That prevarication has also been applied to standing charges. It is difficult to comprehend why energy companies' profits and policies regarding standing charges are apparently untouchable by the Government. We would push for more concerted action on both by the Government domestically instead of waiting on EU developments. I will make a similar point concerning another matter that we have raised with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste a number of times, that being, the need to examine taking the Corrib gas field into State ownership as one way of bringing about reduced energy costs for households. The Taoiseach indicated to me that he did not believe it was in the Government's gift to do so. As I pointed out to him, though, existing statutory powers under the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Acts, 1971 and 1982, countenance this measure being taken. Fianna Fáil previously used these powers in government. There is no limit; the restriction is not a legal one. This is within the Government's power and it is time for radical action. The Corrib gas field is an indigenous supplier of energy, providing for approximately 25% of Ireland's gas needs. There is no reason the cost of Corrib gas increased, given that it is being produced here. Emergency times call for emergency measures. We need to take more radical and creative measures concerning what is an indigenous source of gas. The owner of Corrib, Vermilion Energy, saw revenues increase last year by 267%. It will undoubtedly make exceptional profits this year. The Government should and must consider nationalising Corrib on a temporary basis to help to give households greater certainty on heating bills for the winter ahead. We have sought the Government's introduction of a cap on energy prices. We acknowledge that designing and costing such a measure is complex and that there are a number of different ways to go about introducing it. In our alternative budget, Labour allocated €2.1 billion to support such a measure because a cap would ensure that all sectors of society benefited from lower energy prices. We have seen other member states taking national action while awaiting an EU-wide initiative, which would itself be welcome. Spain and Portugal produced a model whereby they limited the price of gas and electricity production, reducing consumer bills by between 15% and 20%. This so-called Iberian model was the subject of some debate at an emergency meeting of energy ministers from EU member states last month, but it was also the subject of debate in Berlin last weekend where I had the honour of representing Labour at the Party of European Socialists' annual congress in Berlin. I was glad to engage there with the Prime Minister of Spain, Dr. Pedro Sánchez, and the Prime Minister of Portugal, Mr. António Costa, both socialist prime ministers who have led the way on adopting what they call an Iberian model of an energy price cap. This model, which was brought forward by our sister social democratic parties in Spain and Portugal, has shown the sort of proactive measures that left-wing governments can take, and have taken, to protect their citizens from the fallout of Putin's brutal war on Ukraine. At the very least, the Government should pursue some part of this measure at domestic level. For example, domestic electricity credits could feature clawback mechanisms to enable them to be more targeted, such as the withdrawal of income tax credits from those earning more than €100,000. This is something that my colleague, Deputy Nash, has proposed. A levy equivalent to the electricity credit and modelled on the non-principal private residence charge could also be applied to holiday homes and vacant housing to avoid those with multiple properties benefiting disproportionately. We need to see more data on self-imposed cut-offs for households that use prepay meters. We are all conscious that these households and families are among the most vulnerable in the face of the cost-of-living crisis. In the brief time I have left, I wish to mention specific issues relating to those in rental accommodation. Last week, Labour attempted to amend the Government's electricity credit Bill to provide better supports for tenants in rented accommodation who paid their landlords directly for their electricity instead of paying their electricity providers. It was acknowledged by the Government that this was an issue, albeit for a relatively small number of renters. We sought to ensure that renters would be assured of having the benefit of the credit passed on by their landlords. Currently, if the landlord pays the bill, it will be up to him or her whether to pass on the benefit, as was the case with the previous electricity credit. I ask that the Government review once again how best to ensure that renters receive the full sum of the credit owed to them. I wish to discuss district heating. The issue of energy security is significant for those in apartments and complexes that are heated through a shared or district heating system. These individuals are being hit with extortionate price increases because the supplier is the purchaser of the fuel and is charging a commercial tariff. Tenants and homeowners in such complexes have no choice of supplier and I am hearing that many of them are seeing price rises of up to 600%, which is not sustainable. These people and households need targeted supports. In particular, those with district heating systems need a gas price cap now. I reiterate my call on the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications – I am asking the Minister of State to raise it with him – to raise this matter at EU level, where there are ongoing discussions about a Europe-wide cap. I am glad to have had the opportunity to propose constructive measures to tackle the energy crisis and I look forward to the Minister of State's response.	spk_333
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-10-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_29	"The key message for today is we need a winter eviction ban. We have seen it in the report from Threshold launched today, which was unequivocal. It outlined that the most pressing issue facing those renting in the private sector in Ireland is the termination of their tenancy. The fear of termination of tenancy, of eviction, is the biggest fear confronting renters. With over 10,000 people on the homeless list we know just how serious that fear is. Of course, the second fear of renters is of rent increases. Rents have increased by almost 80% in the past decade and risen by 90% in Dublin. Renters are worried they will lose their home through eviction. We need to see urgent action from the Government on this. Threshold has recommended the removal of no-fault eviction from the Residential Tenancies Acts. Twelve months ago, the Labour Party put forward in this Chamber the Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill which would have created, among other things, far greater security of tenure for renters by restricting the situations in which a tenant can be evicted, along with providing for better quality-of-life measures for tenants. Had the Government taken on our Bill this time last year, families who rent would have been guaranteed a safe home this winter but so many renters now do not have that security. I am conscious that my constituency has more than double the national average of households in private rental accommodation. This is a very serious issue. President Michael D. Higgins was right to call the housing situation ""a disaster"". No single section of society is insulated from this disaster. It spans age cohorts. In my constituency I have supported pensioners facing eviction due to unaffordable spiralling rents. Losing your home late in life is unquestionably appalling for somebody facing into older age. It is a social, economic and public health issue but it is a particularly terrible situation for daoine óga na hÉireann. Our youngest generation are facing a future where they have no certainty or security about where they are going to be able to live. My own office has taken to trawling  Will the Government impose an immediate and temporary eviction ban for this winter? It can be done within the terms of our Constitution if it is carried out in a way that is proportionate. There are precedents for doing so. Will the Tánaiste concede this needs to be done now?"	spk_153
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-10-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_29	We have certainly been pushing for a wider response. I ask that the Government take up the renters' rights Bill we put forward this time last year because it addresses broader issues around security of tenure and the quality of living conditions for renters. We were glad the Government did not oppose the Bill at that time but we would like to see further progress made on it. It is useful and welcome to hear the Government is also considering the introduction of a winter eviction ban. It is an urgently needed measure. We see it done in other countries. The Tánaiste mentioned other countries but in France there is a winter truce that begins on 1 November and remains in place until 1 April. During that period landlords have no right to evict tenants, even with a court order, and gas and electricity supplies cannot be cut off. We can learn from other countries where we can see radical measures have been taken to give tenants security, especially through the tough winter months ahead. How bad do we need to see things getting before we see emergency measures adopted here? Again, I reference the proportionate response needed now with the housing emergency and indeed the housing disaster.	spk_155

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-10-12	dail	33	Community and Voluntary Sector Workers: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on our Labour Party motion and to second it. Our motion seeks to secure better pay and conditions for those employed in the community, voluntary and care sector, such as section 39, section 56 and section 10 workers. These are thousands of workers who work for independent, non-State agencies to provide vital support services in the community and voluntary sector. I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, our party's health spokesperson, who has proposed the motion so eloquently and put the case for it so clearly. As he said, while there is a good deal of detail in it, it is a simple ask. We are simply seeking a mechanism for pay bargaining on behalf of these workers. I thank those who work in the community care and voluntary sectors. I welcome those joining us in the Gallery: members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, SIPTU and Fórsa, many of whom work directly in the sector. I welcome Noeline Blackwell, director of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, who spoke so clearly in the media this week about the issues facing those who provide essential care services and enormous support to the health and care services of this State but who are not given adequate pay and conditions, certainly not pay and conditions commensurate with those for the work done directly by those employed by the HSE. I thank those in the Gallery and those they represent for their service to the State and to the people who live in it, and the many who require their services. They are among the heroes of Irish society, filling the gaps left where the State does not have capacity to provide. It is no exaggeration to say that without their work, many of society's most vulnerable members would be left disconnected from their communities. We know that many organisations, including those Deputy Duncan Smith named, organisations such as Enable Ireland, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Rehab Group and many more are lauded and rightly praised as bedrocks of the care and voluntary sector. Their staff provide vital services in communities across the State in supporting those with disabilities, lending their ears to those suffering mental health crises, extending help to people who have lost their homes and giving stability and support to those victimised by sexual or domestic violence. The question, however, is who is caring for those who care for us, who is providing the necessary value and who is valuing the care workers in our society. Despite being effectively paid from the public purse to deliver a public service, the fact that these workers are in indirect employment arrangements means they are in many cases not given decent pay or the same pay and conditions as other workers. As Deputy Duncan Smith said, this motion and the campaign do not seek to bring such workers directly into the public service; rather, they seek just to recognise adequately the work they do, commensurate with the work done by those directly employed within the public service. We know that, for example, section 39 bodies were required to reduce pay during the economic crisis, but the process of pay restoration has been much slower and patchy. I hasten to add that part of the reason there are such issues today stems from the effort made by voluntary sector organisations to lessen cuts imposed previously. All voluntary organisations reduced salaries previously, but many used mechanisms more appropriate to them than the methods applied in the public sector. Workers across the sector are now at least 9.5% behind public sector comparators on ratification of the review terms of the public sector agreement. This is not just about direct pay; clearly, it is also about pension coverage, sick pay coverage and contract terms, with fixed-term contracts being more prevalent. We know that significant numbers of individuals are affected by this. We know that the HSE funds an estimated 1,700 agencies through service level arrangements under section 39 of the Health Act 2004. We know that there are other service level arrangements under other sections of that Act, with, again, many more affected there. As a lifelong trade unionist, I have always maintained that the best way to improve pay and conditions and quality of life for employees is through collective bargaining and the trade union movement. That is our belief as a labour party. I welcome the trade union officials and activists who have joined us in the Gallery. We know that pay claims have been submitted for workers in the care and voluntary sector as part of the ICTU-led Valuing Care, Valuing Community campaign, which my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, mentioned. That campaign is supported by SIPTU, Fórsa and the INMO in particular to ensure that staff working through these voluntary bodies will have equivalent pay and conditions to their counterparts employed directly through not just the HSE but also Tusla. Trade union officials have communicated to me and my colleagues their frustration with the challenges which arise for section 10, section 39 and section 56 workers who attempt to organise through trade unions. When it comes to collective bargaining, the sponsoring Department will usually reiterate that it is not the direct employer. Typically, employers may have an inability to pay. The EU directive on collective bargaining and minimum wages will oblige member states to increase collective bargaining thresholds. That may well lead to a significant increase in Ireland's very low collective bargaining percentage threshold. My colleagues and I have welcomed the report in the past week by the high-level group on collective bargaining. We want to see the implementation of its recommendations. The need to ensure proper valuing of care provided through the care and voluntary sectors has been brought into sharper focus by not just the Covid-19 pandemic but also the acute cost-of-living crisis we now face. So many of the workers who help struggling people are themselves struggling to pay their bills. A constituent of mine who works for an organisation funded under section 39 has told me of their experience, explaining that care workers, who are expected to have a degree in social care or an equivalent qualification, and team leaders, who are required to have a management qualification, are simply very difficult to recruit. Where they are recruited, it is nearly impossible for them to secure 39-hour contracts to sustain themselves. This is therefore not just about hourly pay rates but also about hours of work and treatment at work, treatment which is challenging to contest on behalf of workers because they do not have the same access to the industrial relations mechanisms of the State. As Deputy Duncan Smith said, the hidden victims of the piecemeal arrangements in place throughout the community and voluntary sector are those who rely on the services provided, that is, service users themselves.They are really affected by turnover among section 39 workers, which we know from the Harvey report is as much as one third. Churn is high and this denies stability and consistency of service provision to many service users. I will read a few lines sent to me by someone whose support worker is employed by the Irish Wheelchair Association. He calls her Mary. He said:Mary helps me to live a normal life. [...] Because of Mary and her colleagues, people life me can get that bit of help to stay at home, and we can have a bit of company too. That made all the difference during the pandemic. [...] As far as I’m concerned, she should be paid the highest salary possible. Certainly not less than people who do the same job, but working for the HSE.That testimony goes to show the difference section 39 workers make in supporting the lives of those who need their services and their care. It is not just assisted living support workers either. As I said, we heard recently on RTÉ radio from Noeline Blackwell of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre. She spoke about the difficulty affecting services such as hers that provide vital public services to support victims and survivors of rape and other sexual offences, but do so in the absence of sustainable multi-annual funding frameworks and assurances as to adequacy of pay for staff. I was in Cork last Monday and heard from parents of children with autism and other disabilities. Parents organising through Families Unite for Services and Support, FUSS, Cork, told me the difficulties in securing services for their children are often due to the fact that organisations like Enable Ireland simply cannot recruit and retain staff. Among other things, the parents told me the HSE and even the NHS have been approaching staff members of voluntary sector organisations, seeking - understandably - to entice them to work directly for the public sector in this country, and others where workers will have much better pay and clearly much better conditions and security of employment. Of course, the knock-on effect is felt by the parents I met in Cork, whose autistic children are thereby being denied timely and effective access to services. They are faced with long waiting lists because staff are not available to the organisations providing the support on behalf of the State, and of us all. In the interests of those children and of the many individuals and communities who really need the services provided through voluntary organisations we need to see support from the Government. It must support workers to remain in their jobs and support them to have access to decent pay and conditions. That is what our motion seeks to do and it is a simple and straightforward ask. My colleagues will speak more about the individual provisions contained within our motion and the specific points in it. I hope the Minister will hear our call, and the calls of the trade unions, individual workers, service users and the organisations upon whose help they are reliant. That call is for the Minister and for all the Government because this is a whole-of-government issue. The call is for it to take meaningful steps towards pay restoration, pay increases, and better conditions for workers in the community and voluntary sector. The sector needs sustainable to funding to ensure our communities are truly valued. That is what the Valuing Care, Valuing Community campaign, which we are proud to support, is about and that is what our motion is about. We are glad the Government is not opposing the motion but we hope, as Deputy Duncan Smith said, for a meaningful response that will have a positive impact on the workers, and indeed the service users, we are speaking about today.	spk_29

We need to ensure credits will not be implemented in such a way as to create an inflationary effect and they should be targeted at those who most need them; that is, the most vulnerable and those who are most likely to fall into fuel poverty. We made that point on a number of occasions in the course of the debates on the budget and we again make it here in support of the amendment.	spk_226

            (2) In a case where the persons referred to in On Second Stage of the Bill, I raised the issue that this amendment concerned those who are, for example, tenants in rented accommodation who pay the landlord directly for their electricity rather than paying the electricity provider. The amendment seeks to ensure such renters would have the benefit of the credit passed on by the landlord. Currently, if the landlord pays the bill, it will be up to him or her whether he or she passes on the benefit. That was the case for the previous electricity credit earlier this year. Therefore, on Second Stage, I asked whether the Department had gathered any data on the number of cases adjudicated by the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB where a dispute arose as to who should receive the energy credit in a rental household. Again, subsection (2) of the amendment seeks to address that point concerning disputes around the benefit of the credit and that those can be referred to the RTB for resolution. This is a particular issue in my constituency in Dublin Bay South where we have double the proportion of households in private rental accommodation to the national average. It is, therefore, a real issue for many of the people I represent. The key issue for us is this point about when the final customer is not the occupier, which is the issue the amendment seeks to address. We are asking the Government to examine how best to ensure renters receive the full sum of the credit owed to them. This amendment seeks to address that."	spk_234

It may be that this will only apply to a small proportion of those for whom the credit is not being passed on to the person who is effectively paying the bill. The amendment is designed to address that scenario, even if it only applies to a relatively small number. We are concerned to ensure the credit is passed on in all cases and that is a valid concern. Anecdotally, we are hearing that there are real fears and issues for tenants to whom it was not passed on previously. We put forward the amendment for that reason and we will press it.	spk_238

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-10-11	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_3	I want to acknowledge, first, that the tragedy in Creeslough overshadows all other issues and matters that we are going to deal with in this House today. However, I would like to raise the plight of many thousands of people across this country, who work for independent non-State agencies in the care, community and voluntary sectors. I refer to section 39, section 10 and section 56 workers and all of those in the community sector who need a pay rise. They are among the heroes of Irish society, filling the gaps left where the State has been incapable of providing. It is no exaggeration to say that without their work, many of society's most vulnerable members would be left disconnected from communities. We know they provide vital services across the State, supporting those suffering from mental health crises and extending a helping hand to people who have lost their homes. Without a winter eviction ban, there may well be more of those people needing their help. Such workers give support and advice to those victimised by sexual and domestic violence. Yet, despite their immense value to society, care workers are not valued as they should be. Many have not seen a pay rise since 2008, nearly 15 years ago, and too often lip service is paid to them with no material improvement to their pay and conditions. Many of us stood in the streets and applauded vital health and care workers during the darkest days of the Covid pandemic, but we know that applause will not pay their bills. Indeed, they are among the 100,000 non-HSE staff who still have not been paid the Covid bonus promised to them in January, in recognition of their work on the front lines of Ireland's pandemic response. Nursing Homes Ireland, NHI, handed in letters to the Department of Health at 12 noon today, looking for their payments. It is just not fair that they have still not received those payments. Their work is comparable to that of workers who are directly employed by the State, but unlike trade union members in the public or private sector, care workers in the voluntary sector have no way to negotiate a pay increase at present. Up and down the country, in recent months, they have taken to picket lines to highlight this inequality and disparity in treatment. Because their contracts are not made directly with the State, Government Ministers have been able to claim, repeatedly, that the dispute and the issue around pay and conditions has nothing to do with them. We, in Labour, want to address that inequality to ensure that there is redress for those workers who are providing such vital care and community services. Tomorrow, we will bring forward a motion proposed by my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, to reverse the policy which excludes these care workers from mechanisms like the public sector pay agreements. We are calling on the Taoiseach and his Government to support our initiative. We are asking for Government Deputies to back this important motion to see equality for those providing vital care and community services. Indeed, I raised the issue with the Tánaiste last Thursday and he said then that €100 million in once-off funding for section 39 organisations would cover the cost of pay rises. I ask the Taoiseach to confirm that workers will get pay rises in accordance with that, and in line with their colleagues who are working directly for the State.	spk_19

As the Taoiseach has said, a large number of people are involved, including a large number of service users, people who are relying on the vital services provided by these care workers and community workers. The service users need to know that the services which enable them to live their lives will continue in the future. We need a Government commitment to multi-annual funding. We need to know what the €100 million is to be targeted at. Is it to be targeted at pay rises or the cost of living? Fundamentally, we need to know that the services provided will be capable of being continued because they are vital to our communities across the country. I am glad to hear the Taoiseach say the Government will be entering a process. Will the Government support our motion tomorrow? Will it engage with the unions, those representing workers in the sector, to ensure these vital services are continued? SIPTU is holding a press conference as we speak in Buswells Hotel, calling for justice for those in the care and community sectors who are providing the same services as those provided directly by individuals employed by the HSE. They are providing the same services, albeit through contracts with different organisations.	spk_21

I have been approached by constituents who rent their homes by way of licence agreements rather than as tenants under leaseholds. We sought clarity from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, who has appeared to dispel concerns by stating licensees would be entitled to claim a tax credit but who only referenced only those in the rent-a-room scheme or in student accommodation. Will the credit apply to people in standard licence agreements? We have been critical of the credit because it is simply not enough to protect people and keep them in their homes without the introduction of a temporary eviction ban this winter. We believe that the latter should and could be introduced. As long as the renter's credit is in place, every renter should be entitled to it. Could the Taoiseach clarify if those renting under licence agreements- licensees rather than tenants under leaseholds - will all be entitled to the credit?	spk_40

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-10-11	dail	33	Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_11	"We are in the midst of an unprecedented trilemma comprising three crises. There is the housing crisis that our President has rightly described as a housing disaster and which is hitting many families and households very hard. There is a cost-of-living, energy bills and energy security crisis that is affecting millions of people across the country, exacerbated by Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine and his escalation of the war in that country. Of course, there is also the climate crisis, the existential threat that destroyed towns and communities across Europe this summer and which threatens all of our existence. These emergencies demand bold leadership. I will start by discussing the matter at hand, the energy and cost-of-living crises of which people are so fearful as we face into the winter ahead with rising energy bills. We cannot divorce the crisis in people's ability to pay for energy from the wider economic model we have because the cost-of-living and energy bill crises expose the deep insecurity baked into our economy. Well before the onset of the awful war in Ukraine this spring, there was already a serious issue with our economy, a low-pay, high-cost economy in which many people were living from pay cheque to pay cheque without any savings or security with which to face any sort of crisis. I am not just talking about those on the lowest incomes. Many middle-income earners are seeing their economic security undercut by rising prices. Of course, that has increasingly been the case this year. I have spoken before about meeting couples and families in my own constituency who have told me that, a year ago, their incomes were perfectly adequate to meet the costs of childcare, rent or a mortgage, food and energy but that they are no longer enough as the inflation rate rises and energy and food bills spiral. Fixing the broken economic model of low wages is the fundamental challenge if we are to change our country for the better. An increase in take-home pay is the best way to help working people and families to keep up with rising costs. We need to see the power of employees to negotiate pay rates and salaries with their employers strengthened. As a lifelong trade unionist, I want to see stronger rights for unions to bargain collectively on behalf of their members in respect of employees' pay and conditions.  Along with ensuring that Ireland gets a pay rise and that we see pay rises for employees, we should also look at solutions being pursued by our European partners and must review policies that have already been implemented in this country with a view to supporting individuals through the crisis. That is why measures in the budget were disappointing to us in the Labour Party.Increasing numbers of households are now facing stark choices between heating and eating, and up to half of all households may be in energy poverty in the months ahead. Ireland is just not working for far too many people, including individuals, families, households and businesses. Sadly, rather than providing a more sustainable pathway forward in the budget, it might have been better described as a treadmill budget, or a budget for standing still, without the sort of long-term sustainable measures we needed. Lots of money was put forward by the Government for once-off measures but ultimately there was no sense of forward momentum or progressive movement and no sense that the budget will do anything other than provide a short-term quick fix, which is likely to wear off very quickly, before the new year. The signs are grim that we may need another budget in the new year once the benefit of the short-term measures has faded away. In respect of the specific measure contained in this Bill, it will be welcome in easing the burden for many households and families. We in the Labour Party will certainly support this initiative but it bears repeating that it may not be in any way sufficient to meet the real hardship due to rising energy costs. Over the last 18 months, average household annual electricity bills have doubled to more than €2,000, with an additional €1,200 expected to be added on to the average Irish household bill. Coupled with wholesale natural gas price increases, we are looking at average bills of up to €4,000 per year. Businesses are facing astronomical increases in bills. I met today with business owners who told me about the sort of bills across hotels and the hospitality sector. In retail, small food businesses are facing massive hikes in their energy bills.  For households looking at the increases that are already in place and envisaged in the months ahead, a €600 energy credit, while welcome, will cover only a small portion of the higher cost of electricity. While any assistance is better than none, we would have preferred to see measures such as those included in our proposed alternative budget instead. For starters, we would have implemented a cap on energy prices. We want to see what the Government is going to do about this at a European level. It appears that there will be some sort of EU-wide cap, and that will be very welcome, but we could have done that at a national level. We would have provided a €60 per pupil energy capitation grant winter payment for schools. We would have provided a once-off €400 refundable carbon tax credit for 500,000 of the hardest-pressed families. We would also have invested more in the fuel allowance in order to increase eligibility and provide lengthier payments. The Labour Party led the way in back in January in calling for a windfall tax on the profits of energy companies, when the Government wanted to adopt a wait-and-see policy within Europe. Action could have been taken then and a measure could have been adopted that would have provided real help through a tax on the windfall profits of energy companies. We need that to be done now. I listened with interest to the contribution of Pat Fenlon of the ESB to the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action. He said that increased profits in the power generation wing of the ESB could not be used to offset prices by Electric Ireland as the two sections must operate independently. I do not intend to use the ESB as a pariah but its profits soared in the first six months of this year. It is hard to accept that it is not within the Government’s gift to pass the benefit of those profits on to ordinary households and small businesses. We would also have liked to see a cap on energy prices. Such a measure is undoubtedly complex to design and cost and we acknowledge that. In our alternative budget, we allocated €2.1 billion to support such a measure for households and business, not just through this winter but into next year as well. A cap would have ensured that all sectors of society could benefit from lower energy prices. Many EU countries have already taken this approach at a national level while awaiting EU-wide initiatives. Indeed, Spain and Portugal have provided a model where they limited the price of gas in electricity production, effectively subsidising gas generators since June and reducing consumers’ bills by between 15% and 20%. This so-called Iberian model was the subject of some debate at an emergency meeting of energy ministers from EU member states last month. Fundamentally, energy should be viewed as a common good, especially at this time. The central point to any political debate on energy price caps is that there is more the Government could be doing but there is an unwillingness to address the issue in a meaningful way. The Iberian model brought forward by our sister social democratic parties in Spain and Portugal has shown the type of proactive measures social democratic and left-wing governments can take to protect their citizens from the fallout of Putin’s brutal war on Ukraine. At the very least, domestic electricity credits should feature clawback mechanisms such as the withdrawal of income tax credits from those earning over €100,000. A levy equivalent to the electricity credit could be applied to holiday homes and vacant housing, modelled on the previous non-principal private residence charge, to avoid those with multiple properties benefiting to a disproportionate degree.  I also want to relay the concerns of constituents of mine who are tenants in the private rental sector. I represent a constituency in Dublin Bay South with more than double the national average of households in private rental accommodation. This is a serious issue for so many of the people I represent. A tenant in rented accommodation who pays the landlord directly for their electricity rather than paying the electricity provider should have the benefit of the credit passed on by the landlord. If the landlord pays the electricity bill, it will likely be up to them whether or not they pass on any of the money. This was the case for the previous electricity credit earlier this year. Has the Department gathered any data on the number of cases adjudicated by the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, where a dispute arose as to who should receive the energy credit in a rental household, in respect of the earlier credit granted? This was a serious issue. It is merely anecdotal at this point but I have heard of cases where tenants have been threatened when they raised the matter of receiving the credit with the landlord. In recognition of the power imbalance that exists between tenants and their landlords, which is very marked during the housing crisis with so little supply of private rental accommodation available, I am asking the Government to examine how to ensure renters receive the full sum of the credit where it is owed to them. We have also been pressing for an eviction ban to be introduced by the Government over the winter. I believe it can be done in a constitutional way that is short term and limited, with necessary provisos. Without the introduction of such a ban, the reality is that many of the measures the Government is proposing in order to ease the burden on renters will fail to address their core concerns. For example, I raised earlier with the Taoiseach the issue of the €500 tax credit for renters. There is a serious concern that it will not apply to all renters. It will not apply to those renting under a licence, for example, or renting a room in a landlord’s home that does not fall within the rent-a-room scheme. I sought clarity on that from the Taoiseach and he was unable to give me that clarity. It is a minuscule amount compared to the levels of rent people are paying. Some are paying €2,000 per month in my constituency so a €500 annual credit is very little but it is essential that it be applicable to all renters, at the very least. I also wish to highlight the call of the Irish Traveller Movement for the Government to ensure equitable treatment for Travellers under the credit scheme, just as I am looking for equitable treatment for renters. The Irish Traveller Movement has heard from a number of Travellers who did not receive the first €200 credit earlier this year. The group pointed out that on a site where 22 families share six meter point reference numbers, each family was credited with just €22. While the credits are not adequate to address the real hardship of rising energy bills, it is nonetheless important that they be applicable equitably to all people, particularly those in vulnerable communities such as those who are renting and those in the Traveller community. I would like to acknowledge, as I am sure we all would, that yesterday marked the seventh anniversary of the Carrickmines fire disaster. That anniversary reminds us all of the need for the State to address the systemic inequalities faced by our Traveller community. On the matter of energy bills, there is a strong correlation between those who live in well-insulated homes and those who do not have the same struggles with energy costs. Clearly, the way of the future is to have a high BER-rated home, one that is powered in a sustainable way by renewables and where the issue of rising energy costs and reliance on fossil fuels no longer arises. Let us acknowledge that there is a small number of households across the country, in new homes built to appropriate standards with reliance on renewables, where energy bills do not induce the same fear as they do for so many households that are utterly reliant on fossil fuels. I would use this opportunity to reiterate the need to ramp up retrofitting supports and remove the red tape in the so-called one-stop shop initiatives to ensure retrofitting is made available and accessible to all households, rather than how it is at present.Again, I hear from so many constituents who tell me about the difficulties, obstacles and bureaucracy involved in trying to access supports for retrofitting. Retrofitting is a fantastic initiative but it may be better described not as a one-stop-shop but as the several-steps and an upfront lump sum shop and a long delay shop when it comes to trying to access the grant subsequent to installing solar panels. It becomes unaffordable and inaccessible for many households and businesses. A number of issues regarding the accessing of retrofitting have been brought to my attention in recent times and I can engage separately with the Minister in written correspondence. I would like to seek the Minister's views on something I have raised with the Taoiseach on a number of occasions in Leaders’ Questions. It relates to the management of household energy costs and those suffered by small businesses in Ireland. That is the prospect of nationalising - if even on a temporary basis - the Corrib gas field. Those who are reliant on fossil fuels are facing massive costs exacerbated by international factors, notably the war in Ukraine. High gas prices and indeed electricity prices have been driven by the spiralling cost of natural gas. In Ireland, we have significant levels of gas consumption coming from our own Corrib gas field on this island. We know that Vermilion's revenues last year increased by a massive 267%. The cost of production for that gas has not increased. It should not be subject directly to international price increases yet the price of gas supplies is now costing multiples of what it did one year ago. What is the Minister's view on nationalising the Corrib gas field and bringing it under State ownership - even on a temporary basis - to ensure that we can bring greater certainty to those struggling with fuel bills? The State has the power to do so under the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Acts 1971 and 1982. Powers under this legislation were invoked during the oil shortages that followed the Middle East conflict of the 1970s so these powers exist, are available to Government and were used previously. However, the Taoiseach has dismissed that proposal. I ask the Minister and Department officials to undertake a cost-benefit analysis of this initiative to see if it can be carried out. It may sound a radical measure and it is a radical measure but it is also a sensible one. We are facing into this crisis exacerbated by international factors yet we have a domestic supply available.  Let us not lose sight of the real reason families are so vulnerable to the fluctuations of the free market. The energy bills crisis is caused by the fact we are exposed to the roller-coaster of fossil fuel prices. We must not allow the immediate need to reduce hardship while people struggle to pay their bills to serve as a distraction from the urgent need for action to tackle the climate emergency. We all know that it is only by addressing the climate crisis that we can give people that guarantee that their homes will be warm, the air they breathe will be clean, their roads will be safe, and they and their families will not suffer a massive increase in bills because of the State’s addiction to fossil fuels and an international addiction to fossil fuels that is not unique to Ireland. The Paris Agreement signed in 2015 at COP21 has been called the last beacon of hope for renewed multilateral co-operation and international convergence on the global climate emergency. Since then, we have seen a rapidly closing window of opportunity to avoid climate chaos. In its recent assessment report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, warned that global warming is happening sooner and more quickly than earlier projections and that its effects are more profound. The World Meteorological Organization recently predicted that the 1.5°C target set by the Paris Agreement for the end of the century could soon be breached. Evidence of global warming multiplies in every part of the world on a daily basis. The exception has suddenly become the new normal. This must come as no surprise when we see that global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions rose by 6% in 2021. The Environmental Protection Agency stated that Ireland’s emissions increased by nearly 5% last year and rose above pre-Covid levels.  It was noted that the rise was largely due to the energy industries sector, which tripled its oil and gas use in electricity generation last year. While measures to support families, households and businesses through the winter are necessary, we also need to be mindful of learning the long-term lessons. We know that in the short and medium term, we must shift fundamentally how we consume and produce energy in this country. I welcome the long-anticipated announcement this week of the waiving of planning permission requirements for the installation of solar energy and recent indications from the Minister that our modes of transport will be changed drastically but we need more of that. Words must turn to action and we must address in the short as well as long term that elephant in the room of systemic change. It is time to reject the neoliberal doctrine of the free market when it comes to something as important as energy. It is time to take drastic action to combat the climate crisis and alongside that, the cost-of-living crisis. We must see no more missed targets, no more moving the goal posts and no more ""whataboutery"". The hour is too late and the moment is too serious. It is cheaper to save the planet than destroy it. In all our interests and those of future generations, we must be mindful of that as we debate these measures - urgent though they are - to address the real hardship being faced by so many through the cost-of-living crisis into this winter.

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-10-06	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_25	I want to raise the issue of how we can ensure the continuation of vital community services across all our communities and pay and conditions for those workers who have been outsourced from the State and who provide vital care services through section 39 organisations or section 56 organisations. We all know how many community-based services in all our constituencies are utterly reliant on workers who are paid in this way - not directly by the State but indirectly by the State to provide vital public services. Labour will bring forward a motion in the House next week seeking to ensure better pay and conditions and, crucially, a framework for the sustainable delivery of public services across our communities through adequate resourcing and adequate recognition of a need for better pay and conditions for such workers. We are conscious that until 2008, those employed in the community, voluntary and care sectors, such as section 39 workers, received pay increases under national wage agreements but they have not received pay increases since and they have no formal mechanism for collective pay bargaining. While public sector workers received a very welcome pay rise under Building Momentum, no pay rise or improvement in conditions was provided to the community and voluntary sector. We all know in our constituencies the vital public services provided by workers through these organisations, which include HSE-funded section 39 organisations, Tusla-funded section 56 organisations,section 10 homeless services funded indirectly through the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and a broad range of community services such as those managed by community employment supervisors, whose salaries are indirectly funded by the State.  This was raised yesterday on RTÉ Radio by Noeline Blackwell of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, who spoke about the difficulty affecting services such as hers, which provide vital public services to support victims and survivors of rape and other sexual offences and sexual abuse but are doing so without adequate sustainable funding frameworks and assurances as to adequacy of pay and pay increases for staff employed through the mechanisms I have described - Tusla-funded section 56 organisations in that case. I was in Cork on Monday and heard from parents of children with autism and other disabilities about the difficulty accessing services through organisations that are finding it difficult to retain and recruit qualified staff. Children with disabilities and their parents are losing out as a result. Indeed, the Harvey report on the delivery of health services by section 39 organisations funded by the HSE found high annual staff exit rates of up to one third annually with further reports since then of workers leaving to take up direct employment in the public service, such as directly through the HSE, due to the pay gap and the gulf in terms and conditions. I heard in Cork about how the NHS is coming over to recruit directly from section 39 and section 56 organisations. Clearly, the pay and conditions the NHS can offer as a direct public service are far better.  We call on the Government to establish a renewed relationship between not-for-profit organisations and the State based on a shared long-term vision and plan and to ensure a multi-annual funding framework to provide certainty for providers, their staff and, crucially, for people like the parents I met in Cork with FUSS Ireland who are dependent on the vital services being provided to their children by workers who are simply not getting adequate pay and conditions compared with workers employed directly through the HSE. Will the Tánaiste undertake to look favourably on the terms of our motion and engage directly with the not-for-profit sector?	spk_211
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-10-06	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_25	I thank the Tánaiste for his constructive words. I do think it is fair to describe services as having been outsourced. Indeed, as the Tánaiste acknowledged, the State has a long history of outsourcing vital public services such as health and education to voluntary bodies, notably the Catholic Church and religious orders resulting in a shadow welfare state. Now in 2022, we need to ensure that we move to a different mode of delivery of services and that the State is stepping in to ensure those who are providing the same services as HSE staff but are doing so through being employed by voluntary bodies get the same pay and conditions, otherwise it is inevitable that the HSE, the NHS and others will seek to recruit them. The Tánaiste will be aware that pay claims have been submitted as part of the ICTU-led Valuing Care, Valuing Community campaign supported by SIPTU, Fórsa and the INMO in particular to ensure that staff working through these voluntary bodies, including section 39 and section 56 organisations, will have equivalent pay and conditions to their counterparts employed directly through the HSE and Tusla. Otherwise we will simply see a real diminution of services throughout the country.	spk_213
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-10-06	dail	33	Ceisteanna ar Pholasaí nó ar Reachtaíocht - Questions on Policy or Legislation	dbsect_26	What specific action does the Government propose to take to address the key points made in yesterday's OECD and Climate Change Advisory Council report on the Irish transport system? The report showed the need for the Government to prioritise policies to reallocate road space from private cars to ensure that walking and cycling are better accommodated. I ask this knowing that although the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, outlined that he would be launching certain pathfinder projects over the coming weeks, we saw no new initiatives for cycling in particular in the budget. That was really disappointing. The Labour Party has proposed a cycle-to-school scheme, which we have proposed for some years now, where the Government would subsidise the cost of bikes for children in the same way that we have seen the very successful bike-to-work scheme operate. We also called for an old car scrappage scheme where cars over ten years old could be exchanged, essentially subsidised for exchange, for e-bikes or cargo bikes instead to try to encourage to a far greater extent the reallocation of road space for cyclists. We saw no new initiatives for cycling from the Government in the budget. That was really disappointing, particularly in light of yesterday's report.	spk_234

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-10-06	dail	33	Communications Regulation Bill 2022: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_28	"I note the welcome aspects of this Bill. Despite the delay, this legislation will see the enforcement provisions in the EECC being transposed into Irish law. This is very welcome, especially the provision for ComReg to have additional powers and a wider remit. We are all conscious in our constituencies of issues around consumer protection and lack of due regard for online security. This Bill is a welcome initiative to redress some of those issues. I am not going to take my full time because I welcome the Bill. I will, however, highlight several issues concerning consumer protection in the online sphere. It is hoped that the legislation might play a role in addressing this aspect. I want to speak about the impact that cybersecurity breaches can have on individuals and also groups of persons, particularly those who are less adept at using new technology. We saw news in the last year, such as the awful real-world harms of the cyberattack on the HSE, that has highlighted the risks associated with new technologies and, indeed, failure to update old technologies. That is why the implementation of this Bill is so important. The huge cost implications around the breach of online security of the HSE was accompanied by horrendous impacts on the health and lives, in some cases, of individual patients. That should never be forgotten. It was absolutely horrendous to see the effects of the cyberattack on the ability of our health system to care adequately for patients undergoing necessary treatments. That is the starkest illustration of the real harm caused by breaches of online security in the recent past in Ireland. Year on year, however, we hear from individual constituents and through the media of people who have been abused or scammed through electronic communications at a more individual level. The advent of online technologies has undoubtedly made people vulnerable in many ways. One area in which I have been campaigning is to try to address the closure of in-person services that have been offering supports to people in accessing or making contact with public services like the Revenue Commissioners, health services and the Department of Social Protection. Citizens Information Board services and the centres it runs have been really powerful mechanisms to provide people who are not technologically literate with the ability to make contact with and make applications to bodies such as Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and other Government Departments. In my area in Rathmines in Dublin, we had a really serious issue when the citizens information centre closed during Covid-19 and all the services moved online. It has not reopened, however, and there are no plans to reopen the building. Indeed, the premises is being closed. Clearly, it could move to another premises and we are seeking to ensure that is done. My great colleague, Councillor Mary Freehill, is working with me on a campaign to try to do this. The issue of the Rathmines closure touched a nerve with so many people. We ran a public meeting in June. Large numbers of people from the local community came along and spoke about how the closure of a face-to-face service and contact point with Government services had really affected and adversely impacted them, and how it made it really difficult for them, for example, to access benefits to which they were entitled or find information they needed. There are, therefore, a variety of ways in which the closure of these services specifically disadvantage not just older people but the many people who have difficulty with accessing technology. The reality is also that it makes individuals who do not have the necessary digital technology skills or who are trying to work through electronic service provision inherently more vulnerable to scammers and cyberattackers. That has a direct knock-on effect. ""Liveline"" also ran a series of programmes over the summer about the closure of citizens information services. This is an issue nationwide. It also reflects the more deep-rooted closures of in-person and face-to-face services and a move online for so many different services generally. It is not just public services. I am also thinking, obviously, of banking services about which we saw controversy. Large numbers of people still want to be able to deal face-to-face with bank personnel and that was really revealed this summer. The reality, which the Government must acknowledge, is that shifting all services, public or private, online to electronic access-only opens up our most vulnerable citizens to cyberattack and cybersecurity breaches. In addition to the new enforcement mechanisms that are set out in the Bill, I ask that the Government might review digital strategies, for which the Minister of State is responsible. It is very welcome to see us moving to digital strategies. The legal profession, in which I was once a practitioner, was far too slow, for example, in moving to use technology for conveyancing. The Law Society of Ireland did eventually move to an e-conveyancing strategy. That is all very welcome. So much of the movement online has been hugely positive. I do not want to sound like I am being negative about this. However, we need to see retention of in-person supports to support those who may have difficulty accessing all services online. We need to see steps being taken to protect vulnerable members of the public from scam telephone calls, email phishing and any attempts to gain access to a personal computer or hijack or hack bank transactions or other sensitive information. ComReg and the Government need to take a more proactive role in protecting the public from this sort of fraud. Some very useful advertising is going on at the moment, which I think is very helpful in that regard. I will speak about the cost of communications, for example, telephone and broadband bills. As we experience a cost-of-living crisis, we currently have a really serious consumer protection issue with increased costs for consumers on telephone and broadband bills. Organisations like ComReg and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, should take up a stronger role in protecting the interests of consumers in that regard. With the indulgence of the Chair, I will mention legislation relating to this issue that was brought forward in 2020 by my colleagues, Deputies Nash, Duncan Smith and Ó Ríordáin, namely, the Consumer Protection (Loyalty Penalty and Customer Complaints) Bill 2021. This would greatly improve consumer protection against price-gouging practices by outlawing what we call the ""loyalty penalty"", in other words, outlawing enhanced costs for retained or existing subscribers of services such as insurance, utilities and telecommunications while also imposing an obligation on service providers to establish a system to handle customer complaints to a regulated standard. I am conscious that other contributors have spoken about customer complaints around the service people get from Eir. The Labour Bill would outlaw loyalty penalties for services provided to consumers on subscription or roll-over contracts. We think it is fair to say that in most consumer relationships, loyalty is rewarded and not punished. The loyalty penalty has been really problematic. It has caused a great deal of angst and concern among customers, many of whom do not have the time or energy to devote to shopping around. I know the advice from consumer bodies is always about shopping around, but that can create its own difficulties. Really, the loyalty penalty has been most pernicious in punishing people who just do not have the wherewithal to engage in shopping around. I should say that we also want to tackle the problems of poor customer service in the telecommunications industry. We want to see and ensure that mobile and broadband providers are required to set up a complaints handling scheme that satisfies minimum criteria. We would impose a general obligation on service providers to set up a system for handling customer complaints to a certain regulated standard. We believe the debacle we have seen with Eir must be addressed and tackled. Again, the issue has been raised extensively by Councillor Mary Freehill. Consumer protection has not been sufficiently strengthened in Ireland in the past. This Bill is a welcome part of change in our attitude towards consumer protection. Unduly regulated markets in any sphere allow the exploitation of consumers who are unable to shop around regularly. Requirements that people do shop around tend to put the onus on the individual consumer or customer to change. We believe there should be more emphasis on placing responsibility on the company or provider of the service and not on the consumer of the service. We want to restore trust to ensure people do not feel ripped off when they access services and ensure that companies are not allowed to discriminate against existing customers by offering cheaper rates that are only available to new customers, nor should poor customer service and handling of complaints be allowed. We know the market alone cannot be trusted to deliver good customer service and fair pricing. By legislating, we can ensure there is adequate regulation of the market in the communication sector, but also beyond that in public and private services generally. I ask the Minister of State perhaps to consider adopting even some provisions on the loyalty penalty in our Bill in amending this Bill to strengthen the mandate of ComReg and further enhance the protections for consumer rights that are really at the core of this welcome Bill."	spk_290

She is a constituent of mine and somebody the Taoiseach has also met. I pay tribute to Finola for her campaigning and advocacy work over many years. She was, as the Taoiseach knows, a central contributor to last night's powerful ""Scannal"" documentary which aired on RTÉ 1 about the thalidomide scandal. The airing of that documentary came at a timely moment because next month marks the 61st anniversary of the international withdrawal of the drug thalidomide. It was removed from the market internationally in 1961 due to the number of babies who were being born with catastrophic or very serious disabilities to women who had been prescribed the drug while pregnant to treat symptoms. In this State, even after international withdrawal, the drug continued to be prescribed for some time, causing severe harm to many children who are now adults. Even children whose mothers only took the drug for one or two days suffered severe harm as a consequence. We know from the powerful documentary and other sources that Government documents at the time show that authorities had considered making a public announcement earlier on the risks associated with the drug and did not do so. It remained in circulation for far too long in Ireland after international withdrawal. The reason can only be assumed or surmised. Clearly, the State bears responsibility for what happened to those children at the time and their mothers and families. The mothers and children, in particular, who were harmed by a negligent Government are still waiting for an acknowledgement of the wrong done to them and a formal State apology. They were offered compensation by a Fianna Fáil Government in 2009 and I know there have been meetings since then. The Taoiseach has met survivors, and the Minister, Deputy McEntee, met Finola Cassidy this morning. However, there has been no official attempt to address the stalemate in the situation. Over decades, the money and packages offered by Governments have not come near enough to meet the real cost of the harm caused and the life-changing disabilities experienced by so many survivors. I pay tribute to those survivors who continue to campaign on this. Last year, the Minister for Health told the Dáil that work was under way to bring forward a Bill to provide health and personal supports to thalidomide survivors, but we have heard nothing since then. We know the State has been dragging out a defence in High Court proceedings ongoing on this issue. Earlier this year, I sought the support of Government parties for a cross-party motion on support for thalidomide survivors. I renew my appeal because I did not get support from Government parties. I ask the Taoiseach to take the lead, in the last few months of his role at Taoiseach, fix the stalemate, ensure the State acknowledges the wrong done to thalidomide survivors and parents, issue an apology and ensure that an adequate compensation and healthcare package is offered to those survivors who are now at an age where they desperately need supports."	spk_67

It has been waiting for a long time. It is very anxious, in particular, about the few mothers who are still left alive. They are owed an apology by the State and an acknowledgement of the wrong done to them because many mothers and women who had babies who were born with disabilities as a result of thalidomide are themselves feeling guilty. That is utterly unacceptable. It is very clear, from the programme last night and what we know, that the State bears responsibility. The State bore a particular responsibility after the international withdrawal of the drug. That has never been formally acknowledged. We need to see an acknowledgement and apology and a decent, suitable and specific healthcare package and compensation offered. That has never been forthcoming from the Government. I ask that the Taoiseach, in the last few months in his role, seek to resolve this damage. Only a small number of survivors are involved in this. Finola Cassidy is such a powerful spokesperson for those individuals who have been done such wrong by the State and others. They were undoubtedly done wrong by the German manufacturer as well, but let us do what we can to put things right. I will renew my appeal for cross-party support for a motion and for the Government to step up and offer a decent package to thalidomide survivors.	spk_69

It appears the EU energy ministers have now asked the Commission to examine how the Spanish and Portuguese model of a price cap on gas can be extended to the rest of the EU. Can the Taoiseach confirm if Ireland is in support of a price cap on gas at an EU level? Can he confirm whether the Government has considered any mechanism to cap the price paid for gas at the Corrib field?

A number of relevant questions arise. First, when will we see a date for junior certificate results? I note a events company in Cork is suggesting it will be around 12 October. Approximately 130,000 students and their parents are waiting the results but no date has been set. I would welcome a response on that issue. We in the Labour Party welcomed the announcement by the Government in respect of free school books at primary level. It is a matter on which we have been campaigning for many years. My colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, has led on that. Will the scheme be extended to secondary schools in the budget next year, recognising the immense cost faced by so many families in the purchase of books for secondary school students? Finally, I ask the Taoiseach to clarify whether the schools energy retrofit pathfinder programme is going to be expanded to support a sufficient number of schools to make it worthwhile. It looks as though the retrofitting programme will only work for about ten schools a year at current rates. It is simply not enough.	spk_131

We saw a report on Euractiv at the weekend. I see the Taoiseach is shaking his head so he might clarify this. It appears the EU energy ministers have now asked the Commission to examine how the Spanish and Portuguese model of a price cap on gas can be extended to the rest of the EU. Can the Taoiseach confirm if Ireland is in support of a price cap on gas at an EU level? Can he confirm whether the Government has considered any mechanism to cap the price paid for gas at the Corrib field? In our Labour Party budget proposals, we called for the temporary nationalisation of the gas field to help us to control the input price of the 30% of our gas needs that we produce here on this island alongside the implementation of the Spanish and Portuguese model, given they have limited the price of gas for electricity production.

In my constituency, renters pay an average of €2,000 per month, which amounts to €24,000 per year. For them, the €500 tax credit proposed by the Government, while welcome, is merely a drop in the ocean. Will the Tánaiste agree to bring forward more meaningful and effective measures to help renters, such as a ban on evictions just for this winter alone and a three-year rent freeze? Will he agree to expedite the Labour Party’s renters’ rights Bill, which would give real and meaningful protection to renters currently facing such insecurity and unaffordability?

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-09-28	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_14	Yesterday, budget 2023 was published after what seemed like the longest lead-in ever. With so many leaks, over so many weeks, we were led to believe that this would be a substantial package of measures designed to get struggling communities through this bleak winter and beyond. Unfortunately, that was not what we saw yesterday. What we saw was money spread so thinly that it will go unnoticed by many, and many of those who will benefit will be struggling already by the time the winter is out. There is little there to address the structural problems that make people so vulnerable to market failure and a real and biting cost-of-living crisis. We should have seen a very substantial budget. Instead, what we got was a treadmill budget, with the Government spending money in order to stand still. The Government has not provided people with any real pathway forward to get us through the bleak winter ahead and beyond. When we strip away the €4.1 billion worth in short-term measures between now and New Year's Eve, the budget package for next year will, in truth, do little or nothing to transform this country or the lives of those who are struggling. I refer, for example, to the young people trapped in spiralling rent prices who feel forced to emigrate because they see no future here since they cannot aspire to ever owning their own homes. Once January arrives, it now looks like a mini-budget may well be necessary to address the real supports that are necessary for households through this winter and beyond. Yesterday, the Minister for Finance revealed that his Department had revised its inflation forecast to 8.5% for 2022 and more than 7% for next year. With that in mind, and bearing in mind what I have said, does the Taoiseach agree with my colleague, Deputy Nash, who said yesterday that it looked like we would need a mini-budget in January? Does he agree that such a drastic measure may well be necessary to address the real inequalities that were entrenched in some of the measures in yesterday's budget? I refer, for example, to the tax measures. The reality is that next year, somebody earning €100,000 will be €831 better off. By contrast, somebody who earns between €25,000 and €35,000 will only take home an extra €191. The renter's tax credit will at best pay for just one week's rent for an average person renting in my constituency in Dublin. The €600 energy credit will not even cover one third of the increasing bills people are going to face this winter. What we saw were thinly spread, short-term payouts yesterday. What we need are structural changes in housing, care, climate, and in work. We saw no ambition or vision from the Government in yesterday's budget. It is not a budget that works for all. It is time for the Government to get off the treadmill and to move us forward with proper, substantial and targeted measures that will chart a pathway forward towards an Ireland that works for all of us. Does the Taoiseach agree that the budget has patently failed to do that?	spk_206
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-09-28	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_14	We in the Labour Party welcome any measures that will alleviate hardship for families and households over this winter. We agree that a combination of measures is necessary, but we have proposed three immediate actions the Government could have taken in this budget to alleviate hardship. I refer to a €9 per month public transport ticket to heavily subsidise public transport for all, a €200 per month cap on childcare fees and access to free GP care for all children under 18. Those are the sorts of measure that could have been adopted by the Government in the budget, but that were not. We believe they are the kinds of measure that are necessary. In a rich country, no one should be left hungry, cold or homeless facing into winter. This Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael budget has failed that test. We need an Ireland that works for all. We in the Labour Party have put forward serious, substantial and radical proposals that would have achieved that. It is an unfortunate missed opportunity that the Government did not take up that challenge and introduce a combination of measures needed to address the hardships and fear so many people are facing this winter.	spk_210
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-09-28	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 6: General (Resumed)	dbsect_16	"We knew facing into this budget that we face an unprecedented series of crises – in the cost of living, in energy security and in housing, described as a disaster by our President. We knew that increasing numbers of households are facing stark choices between heating and eating and that up to half of all households are likely to be in energy poverty during the bleak winter ahead. Right now, we know Ireland is just not working for far too many people - individuals, families, households and businesses. Of course, we acknowledge the crises we face have been exacerbated deeply by Russian’s brutal invasion of Ukraine and international factors. However, many of the measures urgently needed to address the crises and to support communities are within the power of the Government at national level. This week we needed Government to step forward with a radical budget of the scale and level of ambition to address the severe levels of hardship faced by communities throughout the country. Just as we saw urgent, ambitious and radical State-led measures rolled out to get us all through the Covid pandemic, so we needed to see the Government adopt similarly urgent, ambitious and radical measures in the budget. The Labour Party's alternative budget, published last week, put forward a clear and costed set of measures to support the building of an Ireland that would work for us all. Our budget proposals represent a creative and radical plan - a genuine pathway to ensure a more equal Ireland. Yesterday presented the Government with an opportunity to move towards that vision of Ireland, a more equal Ireland, an Ireland that works. It was an opportunity to provide a lifeline to the tens of thousands of people for whom this country is currently not working. Unfortunately, it was an opportunity missed. This was not a budget to provide the necessary pathway or track forward to ensure households and communities would be adequately supported through this winter and beyond. Instead of providing that positive pathway forward, this might better be described as a treadmill budget, in which the Government is spending money to stand still, not to ensure any future progress or prosperity. A considerable amount of money has been put forward for once-off and short-term measures, but ultimately there is no sense of forward momentum or progressive movement. There is no sense this budget will do anything other than provide a short-term quick fix, a sugar hit, which will wear off very quickly and likely before the new year. As my colleague Deputy Nash has said, the signs are that we may need to have another budget in the new year once the short-term measures have faded away. When speaking to the media this morning, the Tánaiste effectively acknowledged that. With the cost-of-living crisis biting deeply, many people already feel they are on that treadmill and are running simply to stand still. They cannot see a future of prosperity for them or their children. This budget will not change that. It was simply not good enough to throw money in a short-term way at the crises like snuff at a wake, as Deputy Nash said yesterday. This was a short-term ""Bertienomics"" approach, as Deputy Duncan Smith pointed out, an approach that will do little for the have-nots while boosting the position of those who already have lots. We needed a clear plan to take us through the winter and beyond, a plan with ambition and vision. That was sadly lacking in the package of measures announced yesterday. This has been recognised by many. One response I got from a constituent today accurately reflects public reaction. She said, ""This winter, I will have to choose between eating properly or taking the edge off the cold in my home. I will stay in bed to stay warm. I am a worker, a grafter. I have not been helped in any way by this budget."" Her reaction reflects the reality for many. A different approach was possible. As I said, the Government could instead have adopted the approach we took in our Labour Party budget last week. We proposed a costed programme with a set of immediate cost-of-living measures and a series of longer term plans to improve public services and protect communities from market insecurities. We know households and communities are suffering currently and need to be protected and sheltered from harm. We had clear plans to protect and support communities in housing, care, climate and work. On housing, we called for an eviction ban and rent freeze. These should have been key features of any housing measures announced by the Government. In an Ireland that works for all, massive investment would have been put in place to ramp up provision of affordable and secure homes. Instead, the tax credit for renters that was announced shows just how divorced Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are from the lived reality of renters. Rents are out of control in this country. Renters are paying an average of €24,000 annually in rent payments. In my constituency of Dublin Bay South, which is also the constituency of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, this is a particularly serious problem. We have more than double the national average of people who are renting, with 44% of households reliant on private rental accommodation. Average rents in our area are more than €2,000 per month. For my constituents who are renting, a €500 tax credit is drop in the ocean. As Threshold put it, it amounts to just seven days' rent for anyone renting. The speculative housing market has a hidden human and social cost of insecurity that we cannot afford. Renters cannot continue to pay the price for the wasted years of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil governments.The State needs to step in, freeze rents, ban evictions and commit to building more affordable homes. It is particularly disappointing to see the failure of this budget to provide any real increase for the building of social housing. Social Justice Ireland said another €1.4 billion was needed. That is what we allocated in our budget, but with construction inflation at 14%, the extra capital allocated by the Government fell far short of that, which means there will be fewer social and affordable homes built next year than last year. We called for 20,000 social and affordable homes to be built next year - homes that desperately need to be built. Another disappointment in regard to housing in this budget is the lack of provision for households affected by construction defects. This summer in the Dáil, I raised with the Tánaiste the shocking bills facing people who are living in defective Celtic tiger-era apartments. There are many such apartments in my area and elsewhere across Dublin and beyond. I was heartened then to hear the Tánaiste say the Government would plan to provide redress for households. I welcomed that announcement but there is little substance in the proposals brought forward this week. We await to hear further about what is going to be done for those facing massive bills to address the fire safety and other defects in apartments through no fault of their owners. What the Government has proposed in a housing crisis is a levy on concrete products to raise €80 million a year, which is likely to increase the cost of homes for buyers. Our alternative proposal was for a levy on construction profits that would not have had that effect and could have ensured adequate redress for so many apartment owners. The Government's proposal symptomises its inability to deal effectively with the housing crisis that has paralysed the lives of so many people and in particular destroyed the hopes and aspirations of younger generations. On care, we in the Labour Party brought forward two proposals to give immediate relief to hard-pressed families. Free GP care would be immediately extended to every child and young person under 18 at a cost of €100 million was one such proposal. We believe that no parent should have to worry about the cost when their child is sick. We know that Ireland is the only country in western Europe without universal access to GPs. In spite of that, for four wasted years, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have failed to use Ireland's hard-won prosperity to introduce free-at-the-point-of-access primary healthcare. Last year's budget did commit to a welcome extension of the current scheme. It is also welcome to see that this has now, finally, been done for six- and seven-year-old children in a recycled announcement made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath yesterday. Free GP care should have been extended to all children but that did not happen yesterday, which is a real shame. The measures introduced on childcare were equally underwhelming. The Government states it will fund a reduction up to 25% in weekly fees for those availing of the national childcare scheme, but the proposed reduction will not amount to that level of reduction for most families. Even with the new announcement, a parent in my constituency will still have to pay approximately €250 per week per child. In contrast, under our Labour Party proposal, childcare fees would be capped at €200 per month. That is a cost of only €50 per week, which is in line with childcare fees in other European countries. Such a radical and ambitious move would have cost the Exchequer €275 million over 12 months, which is value for money and an investment in our children's future. In our equal early years campaign, the Labour Party and Labour Women have consistently called for us to opt in the longer term for a guaranteed publicly funded preschool place for every child because parents need affordable, accessible childcare. Early years educators deserve decent pay and conditions, and providers deserve support. Most of all, our children deserve an equal start. To realise that bigger vision for childcare, we would invest €60 million next year to provide a clear pathway toward a universal publicly funded childcare system on a par with other European countries. We saw nothing resembling that level of ambition or vision from the Government in this year's budget. On climate, again, we saw a lack of vision and ambition or any new initiative. Our fiscal budgets must always be seen through the lens of the climate emergency. We know that urgent action is needed to ensure a just transition to a clean, green net-zero economy. To do that, we needed real and radical action in the budget, and it did not happen. In contrast, we in the Labour Party had made a flagship proposal for a €9 monthly climate ticket for unlimited journeys countrywide on public transport, at a cost of €300 million for a six-month period. It is similar to the scheme that was trialled in Germany this year, which saved 1.8 million tonnes of CO2 emissions in three months. That scheme is now being adapted across the various German regional authorities. The Labour Party also proposed a range of innovative measures to protect families and workers from rising energy prices and to move us towards a greener future. We proposed a doubling of the grant available to fit solar panels in houses from €2,400 to €5,000. We proposed an ambitious cycle-to-school scheme to enable parents to buy bikes for children, and a creative scheme to incentivise the scrapping of old cars in exchange for e-bikes. We would have imposed a 30% windfall tax on energy companies, many of which we know are raking in record profits. Instead, the Government appears to have rejected that and proposed a very disappointing wait-and-see approach. It does not appear to have taken on board the very sensible proposal to nationalise the Corrib field to ensure greater security and certainty on energy prices. It is a very disappointing budget on climate. It is not good enough for the young people who demonstrate every week with Fridays for Future, who want system change not climate change. They certainly will not be getting it this year. Finally, on work, again this is a deeply disappointing budget, which has failed to address the real concerns of so many in our low-pay, high-cost economy. Stagnating wages, the rising cost of living, and an energy crisis leading to job insecurity means that many young people are now fearful about staying in this country. They are emigrating elsewhere, bringing their skills and talents abroad and depriving communities here of their contribution because they cannot see a future in which they can aspire to own their own home. That is just not good enough. Ours should be a society where low pay is addressed and where a future is provided for young people, but that is not the case right now, nor judging the contents of budget 2023. We had a unique opportunity in this budget to build better jobs and to build a programme of jobs for good, and develop a just transition to a fairer, greener future. Instead, what we see is a derisory increase in the minimum wage, a programme of tax cuts that patently offers disproportionate benefits to those on higher incomes and an inadequate increase of only €12 per week for those on pensions and social welfare, which is well below the increase of €20 that we in the Labour Party had proposed. The Government had a clear set of questions to answer in yesterday's budget. Will it work to keep people warm in their homes? Will it stop low and middle-income households from going under? Will it support people and businesses struggling to pay energy bills? Will it support those who cannot afford their rent or mortgage payments? Will it keep the lights on this winter? I am sad to say that looking at what is provided in the budget, it appears as though Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have failed those tests. A budget should draw a big picture for Ireland, in particular at this time of crisis. It should be ambitious and show vision. Yesterday, we saw no ambition and no vision. Instead, we saw a conservatism that sees every aspect of public spending as a cost, rather than an investment. Yes, there were welcome measures to reduce costs for households and businesses in yesterday's budget, and there was an important acknowledgement that supports are needed, but at its heart this is not a budget that provides equality. It is not a budget to ensure the building of an Ireland that works for all. In contrast, a Labour Party budget would have sought to achieve real equality: to provide safe and secure homes for everyone; to create quality well-paid jobs that move us towards a green economy and a cleaner environment; to reform taxation to prioritise fairness and redistribution, and to fund a health and care system for children, older people and everyone in between. That is the Ireland that the Labour Party wants to see and that we are building. That is an Ireland that would work for us all."	spk_244

Any reduction in fees of this sort is welcome but it is clearly just a tokenistic measure. Anyone working in the night-time economy who is looking to develop arts and cultural spaces, creativity and trying to ensure a really vibrant future for live entertainment for music and nightlife will see this as far too little and will be aware that we need to do a great deal more to support our arts and cultural communities. The Labour Party's budget noted that the promised reform of licensing laws has to be accompanied by investment in arts and cultural spaces across cities and towns. It is the chronic shortage of such space, and not the relatively small fee for getting special exemption licences, that is really holding back the development of the nightlife industry. I think the Minister said it will be accompanied by a reduction in court fees as well. Clearly that is welcome, but it is investment in the sector that is so essential. I speak as a representative of Dublin Bay South. The south inner city and the entire city centre is a vibrant area in which we are seeing the closure of creative spaces, the pricing out of smaller providers including dynamic young nightclub owners and live music operators, and the domination by a small number of big providers. That is really unfortunate. The real concern is younger people feeling priced out of the city centre with rising rents pricing them out of living there and rising rents for businesses pricing them out of having the sort of creative nightlife we all would like to foster in the city centre. On Culture Night, just last week, we saw a brilliant outpouring of the arts and creative sectors here in Dublin. More could be done than this token gesture of halving the fee. Why was this fee not simply waived altogether? Why are we not seeing the sort of investment in creative sectors that we have called for, including extended opening hours for national cultural institutions and serious increases in funding to help local authorities and others to fund purchases and to support artists and creatives in developing a vibrant nightlife?	spk_174

We welcome a provision enabling an employer to provide an extra €500 in tax-free vouchers to staff. It is one way of ensuring that workers will get a pay rise. However, not enough has been done in this budget otherwise to ensure that workers get the pay rise they need, in particular, low- and middle-income workers. We have put forward a much more significant measure to increase the minimum wage by €1.50 per hour to €12 per hour to reflect the real and growing impact of inflation rather than the rather derisory increase the Government has proposed that amounts effectively to a pay cut because it comes nowhere near meeting the rising inflation for those on minimum wages. My colleague, Deputy Nash, also referred earlier to the inequitable effect of the taxation changes and the fact that lower-paid workers will simply not benefit to the same extent as higher-paid workers. While we welcome this provision, it is only one measure in a budget that otherwise does not go anywhere near to delivering for those on low and middle incomes.	spk_185

As Deputy Cullinane stated, all of us in the Opposition expressed our concern. This is a motion that deals with a substantial proposed payment this year of €5 billion into the rainy day fund, but it was made without notice. It was originally proposed that it would be voted upon without debate. Now we have this very minimal debate and yet this motion is not a financial resolution and there is no need for it to be bundled together with the financial resolutions, nor indeed is there any need for it to be taken today at all. Budget day financial resolutions relate to changes in tax law that need immediate implementation, whereas the National Surplus (Reserve Fund) Act 2019 is entirely separate from this special process, which relates only to increase, reduction and variation or abolition of taxes. There is no reason this proposal should be bundled together with the financial resolutions and dealt with this evening. The effect of it being bundled together is to remove the obligation to have notice, and the normal notice rules under Standing Order 40. It has meant, therefore, that we are faced with voting on a motion on which we have had insufficient notice that deals with very substantial amounts of money. The sums proposed are of a magnitude that would have an impact on budget day arithmetic but which could be debated at a different time.Indeed, they could be debated, as Deputy Howlin suggested, tomorrow or later in the week; they do not need to be debated tonight. More time could be allocated were they given another day. We have put forward our amendment to express our objection to the process by which this motion was put before the House. It provides that if and when adequate notice is given of a proposal and provided adequate time is allocated to debate the matter, the Dáil would then consider this same resolution. There is certainly a strong case to be made for putting money into a rainy day fund, but we have not had the opportunity to debate the case and to hear sufficient argument from the Minister, and this is not the correct procedure for this motion to be put before the House."	spk_198

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-09-22	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_29	Later today, along with our finance spokesperson, Deputy Nash, I and my Labour colleagues will be introducing our alternative Labour budget and our proposals for budget 2023. We are doing so at a time when we are facing unprecedented crises. There is a crisis in the cost of living, and there are exorbitant price increases in food and fuel and in basic household necessities. We are also facing an energy security crisis and a chronic housing crisis, where are seeing so many people being priced out of homes, either to rent or buy. In the face of these crises, and while we are seeing healthy Exchequer figures at macro level, we in Labour are calling for Government to adopt a really serious and substantial cost-of-living package not only to invest massively in the building of new homes and in support for public services, but also to adopt a €4 billion emergency package of measures to help alleviate the real hardship that so many families and households are facing into over this bleak winter ahead, which will undoubtedly be exacerbated by the brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war there. There are measures that we in this country and this Government can take that are in our power to do, even in the face of massive international challenges. We, in Labour, have called for three key measures to be adopted as part of an emergency package of measures to help struggling households and families. Those three measures include, first, to cap childcare costs for families. Every week I hear from constituents who cannot afford the sort of increases in fees for crèches that they are being charged, and from parents who simply cannot access crèche places at all. We are calling for a massive investment by Government in the national childcare scheme to ensure that childcare costs for parents will be no more than €200 per child, bringing us into line with European average costs per month. That is a measure that could be adopted in this budget and could really help alleviate hardship for parents who are struggling. Second, we have called for the introduction of a €9 monthly climate ticket to enable individuals to have unlimited public transport journeys across Ireland. For the price of €9, this climate ticket measure would not only help alleviate pressure on families faced with rising transport costs, but would also ensure that we are going some way to meeting our climate emissions targets in terms of reduction in the transport sector. A similar measure was introduced in Germany. We have called for that to be introduced, even for a six-month period, in this budget. Finally, we are calling for the immediate extension of free GP care to all children and young people under the age of 18. It has been a long-standing ambition of my party. We saw the measure being introduced on an incremental basis previously. However, this Government and the previous government have not done anything to further that ambition and to ensure that parents no longer have to think twice because of cost if they are faced with having a sick child to the doctor. We want to see free GP care extended to all children under 18, and we want to see it done in this budget.	spk_199

However, what we need to see is also an ambition of scale and a real ambition to address these crises that are confronting so many households and a real ambition to take the necessary radical measures that will be required to sustain families, households and businesses through a bleak winter. They are the sort of measures that we saw turned around swiftly by Government in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. They are the sort of measures we are going to be calling for in our budget proposals this afternoon in order to build an Ireland that works for all. Currently, there is a sense of a two-tier Ireland. There is a sense that while some people are doing well, for many and increasing numbers of households there is simply this paradox of plenty, where Exchequer figures are positive but they are not feeling it in their own pockets. What they are feeling is deeply pinched and squeezed by rising costs. That is why we are focusing on social wage elements and the need to ensure that we are bringing down costs for families and households. We are really hopeful that radical measures will be taken in this budget by the Government."	spk_201

A constituent has contacted me because, despite staff seeing a very welcome pay increase at the crèche her children attend, a sizable fee increase has been imposed upon parents. The concern she and many constituents, and others throughout the country, have is that crèches and childcare facilities may have signed up to the new core funding model without passing on any benefit to parents. Indeed, parents are now seeing prices and fees rise in childcare facilities. Is the Government planning to make accessible to parents any list of those facilities that sign up to core funding? How is it proposed to link the core funding allocation with the reduction of costs to parents? Parents are hearing, even from the Tánaiste just now, about reductions in cost that will come about but we need to know when and how that will happen. When will parents actually feel the benefit? When will their children be able to access affordable childcare?	spk_219
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-09-21	dail	33	Energy Security: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I speak for the Labour Party as we face a triple crisis with the cost-of-living crisis, an energy security crisis and a housing crisis. Undoubtedly, the cost-of-living and energy crises have been exacerbated by Russia's brutal war on Ukraine, and we see just this week even more evidence of the brutality and horror of Russia's aggression against Ukraine. There is also no doubt, however, but that the Government has been failing to build up the necessary infrastructure to ensure the supports to get us through a cost-of-living and energy crisis as we face into a bleak winter. There is also no doubt but that the Government has been insufficiently cognisant of the existential climate emergency we also face as we seek to deal with and to address the hardship so many families and households face through rising costs, spiralling food and energy prices and unaffordable rents and mortgages. I hear every day in my constituency from families and individuals who are struggling to make ends meet and whose incomes, until even six to eight months or a year ago, were enough to meet the costs they were facing but are no longer enough to meet those spiralling costs. In Ireland we have a surplus budget figure of €6.3 billion for the eight months of this year and nearly full employment, a paradox of plenty because we see the social contract broken. We see delivery riders unable to afford to eat and having to rely on charitable institutions to get hot meals. That is really unacceptable in Ireland in 2022. The hardship is intolerable. It is in that context we debate this motion on energy security. It is true that the Government is failing citizens who are looking for certainty and who want to know what their bills will be like in one month, two months and three months as we face into the winter. That is what is currently lacking. The situation is at breaking point for so many households, who are now told that their energy bills may reach an average of up to €6,000 next year, a threefold increase on heating and electricity, unsustainable for so many. With this terrible cost-of-living crisis, households and communities undoubtedly need urgent measures in next week's budget to give immediate relief. I think some of that is acknowledged in the motion. However, my common ground with the drafters of the motion ends there, unfortunately, because the motion as proposed by the Rural Independent Group fails to engage sufficiently with the climate emergency. It fails to acknowledge the existential crisis we face. We should not approach any measure seeking to tackle cost-of-living and energy crises without having serious regard to how best we can meet our vital climate emissions reduction targets. It can be a win-win. We can seek to reduce emissions through clever and radical government policy while giving relief to hard-pressed households, but that is absent from the original motion. The global climate and biodiversity crises are existential, so the notion of abandoning carbon budgets is ludicrous. To quote Extinction Rebellion, we must tell the truth about climate and climate change. We are seeing its impacts everywhere - in Pakistan with floods and in Europe with droughts. We have delayed for far too long, and the really bleak prospect of blackouts and freezing homes in Ireland this winter should refocus our minds and strengthen our commitment to insulate communities from the worst effects of climate change. Many of the technologies and solutions we need exist. From agriculture to transport, we know it can be done. Yesterday, I was delighted to visit the ploughing championships in County Laois and to meet there with members of the farming and food production communities, who tell me they want support to give effect to ambitious climate targets. They want to see farming and food production in Ireland rendered sustainable not only for them and their children but for all our communities as we face into a climate emergency. It was wonderful to see the engagement with our Labour Party stall at the ploughing championships and to hear from so many people involved in agritech about exciting new initiatives and entrepreneurship. From my constituency, in Ranelagh, Concept Dairy has developed a new app for dairy farmers. There are really ambitious and exciting innovations there, supported by Enterprise Ireland and others. It was very exciting to see this sort of work being done. We know we can do this. We can meet our climate targets and make Ireland the renewable superpower we can be, but for that we need a new economic model which generates wealth and prosperity for all but which also supports emissions reductions and breaks the hold of the fossil fuel oligarchs and magnates, and indeed the polluting dictators mentioned in the motion. There is a better way possible than that envisaged in the motion, and we need to be clear about that. We in the Labour Party do not believe, for example, that Ireland needs floating LNG terminals. We are open to the development of storage facilities, of course, but only on condition that such facilities can be repurposed for renewables - in other words, they can be future-proofed. To be fair, the Government acknowledges that too, but as a cost control measure and a way of addressing the energy and security crisis, the Labour Party has also called on the Government to take temporary ownership of the Corrib gas field, our indigenous gas supply, which could be provided to the market at cost plus a reasonable margin for the production facility rather than the Government and indeed households having to pay exorbitant costs for gas that is produced here, the price of which should not be set by international conditions. I have called for that already in this House, and I would be glad if the Minister of State would take that call back to his colleagues in the Government. What Ireland really needs for energy security in the longer term, and medium term, is rapid deployment of offshore wind. That should have been also a short-term approach. Floating LNG is not a sound long-term strategy for Ireland because we all know the future is renewable energy. If as much political energy were to go into resolving why offshore wind development has been so delayed as goes into when we need LNG terminals, we would be in a much more secure position. As a starting point, we need to ensure that emergency measures are introduced to alleviate pressure on households while we develop urgently our infrastructure for deriving more energy through renewable sources, in particular, offshore wind. We have called for the immediate introduction of a windfall tax on excessive profits for energy companies, an immediate price cap on energy bills and the extension of eligibility for the fuel allowance to ensure that more low- and middle-income households can be brought into the allowance to alleviate hardship in the short term this coming winter. These represent significant measures to get our communities through this winter.We also need to see vastly enhanced environmental initiatives to incentivise a rapid nationwide switch to renewables to help to meet our climate targets and greatly reduce household bills. We have called for a climate ticket, unlimited public transport journeys anywhere in Ireland, for €9 a month. Even introducing this on a trial basis would have the added value of helping out hard-pressed households but also helping us all to begin making a real impact on vital climate targets. The Government countermotion is unambitious because it does not seek to do anything as radical as a climate ticket. It does not seek, for example, to double the grant which we should be giving households to invest in solar capacity. That would be a win-win for all. The Government should be incentivising households hugely through much more ambitious measures to ensure they switch to renewables and to solar. Many households are already seeking to do this but are hampered, as we know from recent reports, by the excessive red tape and bureaucracy, the low levels of grants available, and indeed the long delays. There are significant delays on the warmer home scheme with delays in getting repayment of grant aid that is available. Therefore, the Labour Party believes we need to see an Ireland that works for everyone and an Ireland that works for all, brought about through ambitious and more radical measures from the Government in next week's budget.	spk_69

We are seeing with alarming frequency distressing stories of families literally left out in the cold. We have seen just this week reports of a family sleeping in a tent in Herbert Park in our own constituency. We in the Labour Party have called on the Government to grasp the nettle on housing. We simply have not seen sufficiently urgent action. We did welcome the endowing of local authorities with powers to allow them to buy rental properties and to keep renters in a home when the landlord chooses to sell, but whenever families contact me who are facing eviction, I have yet to see that policy having positive effect for them. We need to see more radical and urgent action taken by the Government, and we need to see a temporary but immediate ban on evictions to protect renters and protect families facing eviction this winter.	spk_163

That is an extraordinary and alarming figure. We know that already the cost-of-living crisis is biting hard on so many households, families, and individuals across the country. In the face of this, the Government has only committed to an increase in the minimum wage to bring it to €11.30 per hour, amounting to an inadequate response. There has been a real cut in wages for the lowest paid in our society and, furthermore, people will have to wait six months before they see any increase in the money in their pockets. My colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, raised this issue with the Tánaiste this morning. The Labour Party wants to see a meaningful increase in the minimum wage. We want it brought to the living wage of €12.90 per hour. We want that ambitious and radical measure taken by the Government, because we believe Ireland needs a pay rise. We want to see people having more money in their pockets to enable them to meet the scary increase in the cost of living that is frightening so many families and individuals as we face into this bleak winter. Will the Tánaiste commit to a meaningful increase in the minimum wage?	spk_219

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-09-15	dail	33	Security of Electricity Supply: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_32	I thank the proposers in the Regional Group for putting forward this motion on security of energy supply. Clearly, this is a hugely pressing issue and very topical as we face into what can only be described as a bleak winter ahead, a winter which we know many households and many struggling families and individuals, are already in fear of. All of us are meeting people around the country, in our constituencies, who are really fearful about the winter ahead, the cost of energy and the consistency of energy supply. We therefore face a twofold energy crisis this winter. It is about not only security and consistency of supply but also the cost and the affordability of energy. That is very clear. In the Minister of State's opening remarks he pointed out that, even separate from the war in Ukraine, there were challenges to the security of electricity supplies in Ireland already. That is absolutely true. My colleagues in Labour and I have previously been highly critical of the failure of this Government to ensure delivery of previously contracted capacity. I recently sat in on a climate committee meeting at which we heard representatives of EirGrid and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities speak about that unfortunate failure to deliver previously contracted capacity and the effect it has had in creating a greater risk to the security of our energy supply. I therefore agree absolutely with the Minister of State that there are challenges to the security of energy and, in particular, of electricity supplies in Ireland this winter. Some of those challenges, however, were already clearly evident in the failure to deliver the contracted capacity. I think we all acknowledge that those challenges have been massively exacerbated, the concerns have been exacerbated and the costs have increased hugely due to Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine and Vladimir Putin's weaponising of gas supplies across Europe. There is no doubt about that, and we are feeling the impact here. Having said that, we are all also very much aware that it is clear we are not as exposed to Russian weaponising of gas supplies as other European countries are. The Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, have previously pointed out that 75% of our gas is imported through the UK. Of course, we also have our own indigenous supply of gas in the Corrib gas field. I will speak about that in a moment. I will speak first about a position that has been put forward by some. I know that the Minister of State did not refer to it in his opening remarks, but I am talking about the issue of storage and, in particular, suggestions in some quarters that we need floating LNG storage. I will say this on behalf of Labour. While we await the energy review report, to which the Minister of State has referred, we do not believe we need to see floating LNG terminals. I think any storage facilities could be contemplated only on the basis that they would be future-proofed. I think the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has made that same point. In other words, such storage facilities would have to be capable of being repurposed for green hydrogen or renewables. Otherwise, the introduction of such facilities would be a highly regressive measure. I think we are also conscious that the countries that need floating LNG most are those, such as Finland and Germany, that were heavily reliant on Russian gas and that have had to diversify rapidly and that we are not quite in that position. Clearly, however, what we really need for energy security is a rapid and urgent deployment of increased renewable capacity, in particular offshore wind. We have supported the Government's attempts and Government measures to introduce the necessary planning framework to ensure we can develop offshore wind rapidly, but we need to see a much speedier roll-out. I am conscious there will be a conference next week, I think, or in the coming weeks for those involved in offshore wind. What I hear from stakeholders and wind energy companies is a real readiness to get these offshore wind terminals built and a frustration at the slow pace of roll-out. That is a key issue with energy security. The other energy security issue I wish to raise - I raised it yesterday in the Dáil also - is the Corrib gas field. I ask both Ministers present to consider seriously how we can address questions and concerns about security of supply through taking a new approach to Corrib and Corrib gas. It makes no sense that Corrib gas should be priced as if it were internationally traded. It is produced here, off this island, and nothing has happened to increase the cost of production or supply of Corrib gas. I have called on the Government to use existing powers under the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Acts 1971 and 1982. Those powers were first invoked during the oil shortages in the 1970s. The legislation was amended in the 1970s by Fine Gael, in fact, to extend its coverage so as to include natural gas.The Acts give the Government the power that if the exigencies of the common good necessitate the regulation or control by the State of the acquisition, supply, distribution or marketing of fuels, the Minister may then make all the necessary orders. The test is the exigencies of the common good. What we hear from people around the country is that the common good now demands the sort of emergency measures that would, for example, involve the taking over by the State, temporarily, of Corrib gas output so that it could be sold to the State on a cost-plus basis. This would reduce the cost to consumers and would in no small way go towards addressing the hardship and fear of so many families and businesses as they face into a winter with uncertainty around supply and cost. In the House yesterday we spoke on the cost issue but it is worth repeating. Small business owners whom I have met say that the cost of their energy bills is now equating to or greater than the cost of their rent. As we all know, rent is a significant cost for any small business owner. It is usually the greatest cost that has to be factored in, but now energy bills are reaching that level. We heard about the shocking figure of €21,000 for an energy bill for a business in Roscommon. Households face projected costs of energy bills of up to €6,000 per year, three times what was the expected average energy bill for households. This is at a time when other costs are also increasing. The cost-of-living crisis is biting so many households and family in terms of food prices, childcare, and rents. Here in Dublin Bay South, in this constituency, people contact me because they have been told their rents are going up, or they have been given a notice to quit. They simply cannot find affordable accommodation. People have told me that they have made and sent literally hundreds of phone calls and emails to landlords advertising properties. People who are renting apartments have told me that they are inundated and flooded with requests to rent, if they put a property up for rent just because there is such a shortage and costs are so high. This is the cost-of-living crisis that is really hurting and affecting so many people, families, households, and businesses. Energy costs and uncertainty around energy costs are a huge part of that. The Labour Party has called on the Government to introduce a windfall tax in order to curb excessive profits of energy companies. We have called for a cap on energy prices as well as an expansion of the eligibility criteria for the fuel allowance. Some €15 million would mean 16,000 more families would be within the fuel allowance criteria. That would be one way of addressing hardship for those most affected and most in fear as we face into this bleak winter.	spk_355

I also note the very positive contribution their queen made to relations between Britain and Ireland on her visit here, not just to Cork but also to Dublin and other parts of the country in 2011. We all remember that visit with great affection. I pay tribute again to the contribution that state visit alone made to improving relations between our islands. As the Dáil and Seanad resume today, we face into a bleak winter with dark clouds gathering on the horizon, and I think all of us are very conscious of that, as we see energy bills increasing dramatically for so many struggling households and families. Households are facing the dreadful prospect of energy bills that could reach €6,000 per annum next year.Small businesses are telling us that their energy bills are now as much as their rent and it is like paying a second rent for many SMEs. People and small business owners are really scared. They are facing into this very frightening period ahead, and they want to see some certainty, security and reassurance and also a sense of urgency from this Government. There is one way in which we believe the Government can and should act with greater urgency. We want to see a really clear signal that the exorbitant profits being made by energy companies will be targeted, and that we are not going to see those take precedence over the real prospect of energy poverty for so many households, families and businesses. We know that many of our EU partners have already taken action on energy bills. We know that in the budget to be published in the coming weeks, it will mean the difference for so many families between being able to get by or having to choose between heating and eating as they see bills for food as well as fuel skyrocketing. We know also there are jobs at risk here. Can the Taoiseach's Government act swiftly on this issue to introduce a range of measures, but in particular, a windfall tax to target profits and to fund the other measures that will be needed to alleviate hardship for families? In January of this year, we in the Labour Party first called for a tax on the profits of energy companies. The best time for Government to have introduced that measure would have been then, but clearly now it is still extremely important that it be done. Indeed, the British Government did it in July, the Italian Government did something similar, and we are seeing moves at EU level. We need that immediate introduction of a windfall tax alongside an immediate maximum price cap on energy bills and the third prong for which we have called, namely, the extension of eligibility for the fuel allowance to more households, including low- and middle-income households. We have the costings. We know it would cost €15 million to raise the threshold to €250 per week. That would bring quite a number of households back into the eligibility criteria and alleviate significant hardship. We need to bring in these measures to ensure that the excessive profits of energy companies are harnessed by this State.	spk_27
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-09-14	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_4	I thank the Taoiseach. That is important and we welcome the moves made at EU level on a windfall tax but there are things the Government could do here too that should be done. Let us look at it in the following way. We have significant levels of gas consumption coming from our own Corrib gas field on this island and we know that Vermilion's revenues last year increased by 267%. The cost of production for that gas has not increased but the price of gas supplies is now costing multiples of what it did one year ago. Will the Taoiseach examine the idea of nationalising the Corrib gas field and bringing it under State ownership, even on a temporary basis, to ensure that we can bring greater certainty to families, households and businesses struggling with fuel bills? The State has the power to do so under legislation introduced by Fianna Fáil, namely, the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Acts 1971 and 1982. These were powers invoked during the oil shortages which followed the Middle East conflict of the 1970s. We know these powers exist and we have used them before. In parallel with the welcome measures at EU level, we need to see this Government doing more in Ireland to ensure that excessive profits are harnessed from the energy companies to alleviate the real hardship faced by so many struggling individuals, families and businesses as they see their energy bills skyrocketing.	spk_29

We in the Labour Party have proposed a measure that would have the dual effect of helping households struggling with bills and helping us to reach our very much-needed climate targets, and that is Labour's climate ticket. Our proposal is that the Government would introduce in the forthcoming budget a ticket for unlimited public transport journeys around Ireland for everyone for €9 per month. If the Government were to do this, even on a three-month trial basis to the end of the year, it would cost about €150 million. We believe it would have a really positive impact on so many households. We have seen it done in Germany. It was introduced there by the centre-left government to great effect in terms of addressing household bills and reducing climate emissions, encouraging more people onto public transport and out of cars. Will the Government help people in Ireland get out of their cars and get their bills out of the red by introducing a climate ticket?	spk_116

I look forward to engaging with the Taoiseach on that. In terms of strategic priorities for our economic development and social progress, one glaring issue which requires prioritisation by the Taoiseach and Government is childcare and early years education. The State is currently investing millions into a mostly privately run, for-profit sector, but we are still no closer to the sort of public, universal childcare service for which the Labour Party has long advocated.

I want to raise with the Taoiseach a particular issue pertaining to a service which has been providing a similar service to the public, namely, the Citizens Information service, which over some decades now has been providing a very important face-to-face service across our communities but about which we are hearing increasing concerns. We have seen changes to the service, the closure of face-to-face offices, a failure to reopen offices after Covid and a whole-scale movement online of these vital information services. Indeed, over the summer, this issue was raised extensively on ""Liveline"", as people around the country spoke of their concern about hearing their local services were being closed.In my constituency, Dublin Bay South, we held a public meeting in Rathmines about the failure to reopen the local office there. Our local Labour Party councillor, Mary Freehill, and I both had extensive engagement with members of the public about their concerns on this issue. We had a big turnout at a town hall meeting we held in Rathmines and we heard from those who had been volunteers with the service and, more importantly, from those who had been using the service, including clients of the service and those who had benefited from the face-to-face access to information that it had provided to them. A whole-scale movement online goes against the ethos of the Citizens Information centres and service. Labour's Frank Cluskey had originally insisted on the establishment of Citizens Information services in order that people would not effectively be dependent on Dáil Deputies' clinics to find out their rights and to be able to engage with Departments and local authorities. Now we have a situation where we are seeing face-to-face and community services being stripped down and closed down. I appeal to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, to ensure there is sufficient resourcing to enable the maintenance and retention of face-to-face community services, such as Citizens Information services of this kind, which have provided such an important bridge to many local communities and individuals in accessing information about their rights and the sort of entitlements they have from the State.

We have to recall those who come here fleeing other wars. In recent days, I have heard real concerns around a resettlement programme for Syrian refugees fleeing war and Afghan refugees who are here and in many cases seeking family reunification, and the need to speed up the processing of their applications. That is important, alongside the welcome we need to continue to extend to those fleeing the war in Ukraine. I return to energy and the EU policy thereon. We welcome moves at EU level to introduce a windfall tax on the excessive profits of energy companies. I referred earlier to the Corrib gas field and there is something the Government should do now to address the profits being made there. The revenues from Corrib increased almost fourfold last year, though nothing has happened to increase the cost of production or supply, nor is there any international competition that would boost the price of Corrib-generated gas. That price has increased dramatically solely as a result of factors which should have no direct impact on the Irish market. It makes no sense that Corrib gas should be priced as if it were internationally traded and could power German factories in the Rhineland when it is being used here. I propose the Government invoke existing legislative powers for the duration of the emergency on a temporary basis, to ensure Irish-produced gas is sold to the State on a cost-plus basis, bringing down costs for consumers.	spk_264

I am glad to say that we, in the Oireachtas special Joint Committee on Gender Equality, are on track to complete our work in December and to produce a report on the implementation of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality. I look forward to engaging with the Taoiseach on that. In terms of strategic priorities for our economic development and social progress, one glaring issue which requires prioritisation by the Taoiseach and Government is childcare and early years education. The State is currently investing millions into a mostly privately run, for-profit sector, but we are still no closer to the sort of public, universal childcare service for which the Labour Party has long advocated. Our current system is failing parents, professionals, providers and, most importantly, children. Every day, I hear from constituents who cannot access any place in childcare and this is particularly the case for babies who are under 12 months old. One woman who was very distressed contacted me. Her baby is yet to be born, but she anticipates that she will have immense difficulty in finding any crèche place, let alone one that is affordable, particularly until her child reaches 12 months old.

I want to raise with the Taoiseach a particular issue pertaining to a service which has been providing a similar service to the public, namely, the Citizens Information service, which over some decades now has been providing a very important face-to-face service across our communities but about which we are hearing increasing concerns. We have seen changes to the service, the closure of face-to-face offices, a failure to reopen offices after Covid and a whole-scale movement online of these vital information services. Indeed, over the summer, this issue was raised extensively on ""Liveline"", as people around the country spoke of their concern about hearing their local services were being closed.In my constituency, Dublin Bay South, we held a public meeting in Rathmines about the failure to reopen the local office there. Our local Labour Party councillor, Mary Freehill, and I both had extensive engagement with members of the public about their concerns on this issue. We had a big turnout at a town hall meeting we held in Rathmines and we heard from those who had been volunteers with the service and, more importantly, from those who had been using the service, including clients of the service and those who had benefited from the face-to-face access to information that it had provided to them. A whole-scale movement online goes against the ethos of the Citizens Information centres and service. Labour's Frank Cluskey had originally insisted on the establishment of Citizens Information services in order that people would not effectively be dependent on Dáil Deputies' clinics to find out their rights and to be able to engage with Departments and local authorities. Now we have a situation where we are seeing face-to-face and community services being stripped down and closed down. I appeal to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, to ensure there is sufficient resourcing to enable the maintenance and retention of face-to-face community services, such as Citizens Information services of this kind, which have provided such an important bridge to many local communities and individuals in accessing information about their rights and the sort of entitlements they have from the State. Without this sort of face-to-face service, many disadvantaged individuals and households are really affected and feel they have nowhere to turn."	spk_219

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-09-14	dail	33	Measures to Assist with Household Bills: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_21	All of us speak on the motion this evening in the context of what the Minister has rightly described as unprecedented times. In effect, we have a three-pronged crisis - a cost-of-living crisis, an energy crisis and a chronic housing and homelessness crisis. This is framed by the overarching spectre of the climate emergency. It is indeed an unprecedented time. On this side of the House, as well as on the Government benches, we are all conscious that if these crises are not urgently addressed by the Government we are going to see severe hardship visited upon families, households and businesses over the coming bleak winter. We are going to see the poorest households forced to take impossible decisions between heating or eating. We are going to see thousands of working families driven into poverty and debt and we are going to see yet another generation of young adults unable to find or fund secure accommodation and be forced into emigration. Already, many of us are hearing harrowing stories from people. In my constituency, Dublin Bay South, which is also that of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, I hear of people faced with eviction and notices to quit, who are devastated at the prospect of trying to find suitable or affordable accommodation anywhere local. We are told by charities about couriers, people who are working and who deliver food to others, but who cannot afford to buy food for themselves. They are turning up for free dinners handed out by the charities. That is simply not acceptable. We hear from small business owners, who are faced with soaring energy bills that are now reaching the level of an additional rent or leasehold. These are extortionate costs that households and businesses are facing, and we need to see concerted and urgent action from the Government on it. That is why we in the Labour Party very much welcome the opportunity tonight to debate the upcoming budget and the package of measures necessary to address this hardship. I mentioned that yet another generation of young adults is forced to emigrate. I am from a generation that grew up in the 1980s when emigration and unemployment were high. We were facing a 20% unemployment rate and, like now, we were seeing families at their wits' end with unaffordable prices for food and fuel. Some things are very different from the 1980s. Now we have what could be described as a paradox of plenty where we have got a successful macro economy.We have Exchequer figures showing a surplus of €6.3 billion for the first eight months of this year alone. We do not have the sort of unemployment figures that we had in the 1980s and that is obviously extremely positive. All the more reason, then, to address the spiralling cost of living because the resources are there. We in the Labour Party have called on the Government to take ambitious, radical and creative measures, to adopt State-led measures of the sort and scale that we saw during the Covid pandemic in order to tackle the hardship that will be faced by so many families, households and businesses but what we are hearing from Government is a lack of urgency. It appears that there is no reassurance forthcoming from Government. We are told to wait and see what the forthcoming budget will contain. People are really fearful now about what is coming down the tracks and yet it appears that in Government Buildings the blinds are down, the shutters are up and obviously the heating is off as we all seek to cut costs on energy.  I am meeting people who tell me that six months or a year ago the incomes they had were sufficient to meet their costs. I am talking about two-income households, about people in what would be considered good jobs who are no longer able to meet costs like the €1,200 monthly that people are having to pay for childcare and early years education. That is what parents are paying in Dublin Bay South now. People are having to think twice about bringing a child over six years of age to the doctor because each doctor's visit is costly. We know that households are now facing the prospect of energy bills of up to €6,000 per annum next year. These are the sorts of burdens and hardships that have to be addressed. We really need to see very strong and urgent action from the Government.  On the energy crisis, we in the Labour Party have called for a three-pronged approach. We want to see the immediate introduction of a windfall tax on excessive profits in energy companies. I raised this earlier today with the Taoiseach. I very much welcome, as do my Labour Party colleagues, the moves at EU level that the Minister spoke about to devise such a tax. We have also called for a maximum price cap on energy bills and the extension of eligibility for the fuel allowance for low- and middle-income households. It would cost €15 million to bring 16,000 new households within the eligibility criteria for fuel allowance. That in itself would be a significant way of alleviating hardship for those families. On the windfall tax issue, the Minister mentioned very briefly in his opening remarks the Corrib gas field, which I raised earlier today. The Taoiseach mentioned that we import 75% of our gas but there is a glaring elephant in the room here. The Corrib gas field supplies about one quarter of our gas needs. It is local supply, on this island. Revenues from Corrib increased almost fourfold last year and the company is enjoying another year of bumper profits yet nothing has happened to increase the cost of production or supply of Corrib gas. There is no international competition to boost the price of Corrib gas yet the price has increased dramatically. That is why I raised with the Taoiseach earlier and raise again now with the Minister the proposal that we look at what powers are available to Government to ensure that the cost of indigenously produced gas can be reduced in order to go some way to meeting the cost of this energy crisis. Clearly, this is not a panacea but is just one measure that could be considered. We are proposing that Government would look at existing legislation, including the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Acts 1971 and 1982, which were introduced by previous Fianna Fáil Governments to equip the State with the power to regulate and control the supply and distribution of fuel including gas and invoked previously during the oil shortages in the 1970s. When one looks at that legislation, one sees that there are clear powers there that could be invoked on a temporary basis for the duration of this emergency to ensure that all Irish-produced gas could be sold to the State on a cost-plus basis, in substitution for the current distorted international prices which are not relevant to the market for Corrib gas. We all acknowledge that the market at EU level needs radical change in any case. Indeed, the EU and Ms Ursula von der Leyen have acknowledged that. Just looking at our own supply, though, there is a measure available to Government now because the State could then sell Corrib gas into the Irish market at a reasonable cost-plus price. We have done some creative thinking on this and I urge the Minister to consider this measure. Clearly there are also many other measures that need to be introduced to alleviate the pressure on households and to ensure that families and individuals can get through the winter ahead. We need to see vastly enhanced environmental initiatives incentivising a rapid switch, nationwide, to renewables. I know the Minister has already brought forward some measures on that but there are some things that could be real win-wins like increasing the grant for solar panels, for example. We should be really encouraging more and more households to invest in and switch to solar power because that will have a double-positive effect of both reducing emissions and tackling household energy bills.  We have also argued in the face of this chronic cost-of-living crisis that Ireland needs a pay rise and that as a minimum we should see an increase in the minimum wage so it becomes a living wage. That is something that the trade unions have called for and that is clearly necessary. We also need to support small businesses facing the massive hikes we have all heard about in energy bills and basic costs. My colleague Deputy Nash has proposed the introduction of a temporary wage support scheme modelled on the pandemic-era schemes to provide much-needed relief to small and medium enterprises that are struggling with vastly increased bills. Of course, in the face of a chronic lack of housing, we need to see massive State investment in a building programme providing public homes on public land and affordable homes for all. We are also asking the Government again to adopt the Labour Party's legislation providing greater protections to renters around security of tenure and against rent hikes, including a freeze on rents for three years. We have also called for a number of emergency measures to address the unprecedented cost-of-living crisis, including a cap on childcare costs to €200 per month because that would bring us into line with the sorts of costs faced by parents in other countries for childcare and early years education. That is the sort of immediate measure that could be brought in and we received some interesting costings from the Exchequer on that. At €270 million a year, it is not an excessive cost when one looks at the difference that investment would make to so many households. We have called for the introduction of a climate ticket, giving people unlimited access to public transport around Ireland for €9 per month. This is the sort of innovative measure we saw introduced in Germany on a pilot basis this year which proved to be so successful. Our costing on that is around €150 million to bring that in for the three months to the end of this year. It would make a dramatic difference to households who are currently facing huge transport costs, would really incentivise a switch to public transport and help us to tackle our climate emissions. We have also called, as we have done for many years, for the immediate extension of free GP care to all children under 18, which can be done for a reasonable sum. I am conscious that we will have other opportunities to debate the budget. We in the Labour Party will be putting forward a fully costed, alternative budget but the real message tonight is that we must see urgent measures from Government. We are in a situation where we have an Exchequer surplus and we need to see that money invested to help alleviate the hardship that so many families and households face and to address the real and chronic fears that we are hearing about all across the country.	spk_319
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-07-14	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_32	In this unprecedented cost-of-living crisis, we all know there are certain individuals and families who are living in particular fear - fear about safety in their homes and fear about the cost of remedying defects in the construction of their homes. Last month, for example, I heard from a mother who informed me that the possibility of her daughter progressing to third level education had been cast into doubt because of the cost to the family of having to fix the defects in their defectively built apartment to ensure it is made compliant with fire safety regulations. We understand the working group on defective homes will be completing its report next week, but we also understand it will have found that up to 100,000 apartments have been affected by fire safety and other defects, with up to 44,000 apartments in the process of being remediated right now. We understand properties in every county in Ireland are affected by construction defects, with a particularly acute problem in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Dublin South-Central, Dublin Bay North and Dublin Fingal. Indeed, in my constituency of Dublin Bay South I have heard from some people who are affected too and I have met members of the Construction Defects Alliance. I have heard great fears expressed by individuals and families. There is the fear of debt due to the cost of fixing the defects, but also a fundamental fear about safety in their homes, primarily due to fear of fire because these homes were defectively built. I understand the working group is concerned that vital safety works on the apartments, which is ongoing, might stall or be deferred pending any new developments, causing unnecessary risk to the health and safety of the tens of thousands of families and individuals living in those apartments. We know that vital safety works must continue and that people must be supported to ensure they do continue. Will budget 2023 include measures to support people living in homes where there are these construction defects? For example, will the budget include 100% refundable tax credits for owner-occupiers who have paid already or who are paying ongoing levies for the remediation of defects in their apartments? Some building management companies will allow for the cost of compliance works to be paid in instalments, but that is not the case for everyone. Many of those who have already been charged with the cost of remediating their apartments say they are unable to pay and have been dealt intimidating legal notices and even threats to put attachment orders on their property. It amounts to a life of fear for the many people affected. It is hard to exaggerate the scale of this pending crisis, which has been somewhat under the radar until now but which I believe will be highlighted by the forthcoming report. It has certainly been highlighted to me by the people I have met. They are in fear. They are in fear of increased insurance costs. Those who wish to sell their homes, perhaps because their families have grown and the apartments are no longer big enough, are forced to stay in unsuitable spaces that are far too small. They simply cannot move on from an apartment that was built defectively and for which an outstanding cost for remediation still exists. Lenders will not allow the taking out of mortgages on defective properties, so the prospect of selling is a real challenge. What will the Tánaiste and the Government do? Will the Tánaiste give a commitment to ensure the budget will address this and guarantee support for those who are so adversely affected?	spk_174
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-07-14	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_32	I thank the Tánaiste for that positive response and his acknowledgement that the Government will have to provide a response for those who, through no fault of their own, are living in this twofold fear in these apartments, the fear of debt and the fear about fire safety, in particular. Following the horrific Grenfell fire in London, that is uppermost in all our minds. The scale of this problem is immense. It is thought that up to 80% of apartments built between 1991 and 2013 may be affected by these construction defects. Many of the people who are living in these apartments are living a life of fear and a life in debt because of the costs already incurred for remediating the defects. I believe a full remediation scheme will have to be developed, and we will work constructively with the Government to ensure that is done. However, we are conscious this will take time and it is vital that remediation work would continue in the meantime. We are asking the Government to ensure people who are paying remediation levies or have paid them will not be at a disadvantage. In the short term, we believe that will mean providing refundable tax credits to owner-occupiers and grants to social landlords in budget 2023 to ensure the fear that so many individuals and families are experiencing may be alleviated.	spk_176

I support it on behalf of the Labour Party and I am glad we are having such a constructive and collaborative debate on it. The Government's proposal to adjourn the Second Reading of the Bill for six months has been accepted by the proposers. This is sensible given that a public consultation is under way and it is such an important issue on which a good deal of preparatory work needs to be done. I very much welcome the concept behind the Bill, which is the introduction of a statutory basis for a green hydrogen strategy. It is an issue I have raised on a number of occasions since I was elected to the House. I recently tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, on the topic. We are all conscious that green hydrogen has always been the energy future, but there is a good deal of work still to be done to ensure it can become a viable source at scale. As we know, most hydrogen is produced by fossil fuels and is, therefore, known as grey hydrogen, but it can also be produced using renewable sources such as wind and solar power. That is the basis for the green hydrogen that is the subject of this Bill. The World Energy Council recently highlighted the challenges to scaling up hydrogen in an energy system, the main one being the chicken-and-egg problem of supply and demand and another being the problem of cost. Green hydrogen costs more than $5 per kg in the West but just as solar energy has become affordable to produce over time, the same can be said of green hydrogen. It is vital this energy source is made economically viable. We need a green hydrogen strategy. As the Minister said, it is both an industrial and an energy strategy. In Ireland, we have an opportunity to build out our renewable capacity to ensure the ability, also based on renewables, to provide much greater energy security for our country. This is a major priority as we see the brutal war on Ukraine continuing to unfold. Indeed, we can become a world leader in renewables and offshore wind production. Green hydrogen must be a part of that strategy. We welcome the idea of a statutory basis for the strategy, as well as the public consultation and the work the Government is doing in this area. If we can build out such a strategy, it will allow us to become a green hydrogen exporter in place of a fossil fuel and liquefied natural gas, LNG, importer. This will have substantial benefits for us and in terms of achieving climate targets internationally. According to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, electricity accounts for only 20% of our energy system, with the majority still produced by fossil fuels. We will require more than electrification to reduce the amount of carbon emitted by our energy system. Already, our 2030 targets will require a reliance on other sources for days when there is little sun or wind. We saw that last year when there was a diminished wind supply during the summer months. During this transition, energy security must be to the fore of new policies. The increasingly alarming reports of energy shortages this winter, with potential rationing of fuel and energy, are focusing all our minds on the need to ramp up our capacity to produce energy through other sources such as wind, especially offshore wind, solar and green hydrogen. We must develop the infrastructure to produce hydrogen and to be able to store it.We must produce hydrogen that is green and produced through renewable sources and that can then be used to power sectors including heavy transport, industry and indeed data centre power generation too. I listened to Deputy Cronin's remarks about cars and transport in her own area and the idea of hydrogen as the fuel to power transport. There have been low-emission bus trials here in Dublin with hydrogen-fuelled buses. There is real potential there for an absolute sea-change in how our public transport is fuelled. It is very exciting and a very positive development. While there is discussion as to the urgent need to phase out the use of energy intensive technologies we also need to build capacity while we are changing our habits. I will not take any more time and I thank An Leas-Cheann Comhairle for letting me in. I very much welcome the Bill. It is time to develop and then implement a clear strategy both to build hydrogen capacity and to ensure that our hydrogen infrastructure is completely based on green hydrogen produced from renewable sources.	spk_340

Europe’s temperatures are reaching record highs this week across the Continent. Human activity has warmed our planet at a rate not seen for 2,000 years. The consequences are unthinkable and the imperative to act is indisputable. Last week, I asked the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, if negotiations on sectoral emissions targets were being jeopardised, specifically by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I reminded him that a reduction in emissions targets for one sector would raise targets for other sectors to what Professor Hannah Daly has called implausible levels. We now know that the long-promised sectoral emission targets will not be published this week, as previously thought. Our concern is that in the last sitting week of the Dáil before the summer recess, we do not yet have clarity on when those targets will be published or whether we will have an opportunity to scrutinise them and, in particular, to see whether the targets for one sector will be set at a level so low that it will jeopardise the possibility of targets being reached in other sectors.	spk_110

The purpose of the study was to discover the experiences of women who have sought to access abortion under our abortion legislation. The words expressed by women include ""awful"", ""draining"", ""arduous"", ""harrowing"" and ""distressing"". This really shows just how inadequate our current legislative structure is to meet the real needs of women in crisis pregnancy and unplanned pregnancy. These are the women we voted to support in 2018 in the repeal referendum when the people voted with a 66.4% majority to ensure women would have access to abortion services in Ireland. Yet what we see from the study published today is that the paternalistic shadow cast by the eighth amendment is still over our system of abortion care provision. The National Women's Council points out that it is clear from the experiences of the women expressed through the study that significant systemic improvements are required. Women share the anguish and distress of being deemed ineligible for care on the grounds of fatal foetal anomalies, the disempowering impact of the three-day wait and the shock many women have had at the lack of GPs providing care in rural communities. We know that 13 counties in Ireland have fewer than ten GPs willing to provide abortion services. Many counties have no provision at all for women. Therefore they must travel outside the county to avail of services, twice in many cases because of the three-day wait period prescribed in the legislation which is not based on any medical necessity. We know that the three-day wait period in particular causes real hardship for those women who struggle to get off work, those on low incomes and those at the end of the first trimester. We know that last year more than 200 women had to travel to Britain to obtain abortions because the law here does not meet their needs. The old Irish solution to an Irish problem phenomenon has not gone away. Every woman who takes that lonely journey represents a failure by the Government and the State to deliver on the mandate the people gave us in 2018. Will the Taoiseach confirm when the review of the abortion legislation will be published? Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and the Government will ensure the review will address the inadequacies in the legislation, as illustrated by the evidence gathered by the team at Trinity College and the experiences so graphically expressed in the report by women describing how they had fared in seeking to access abortion care here?We heard about awful scenarios relating to women who were awaiting diagnosis as to whether an anomaly was ""fatal enough"" to enable a termination after 12 weeks. Some of the definitions in the legislation are deeply problematic not only for women and their families, but also for doctors and medics who face criminalisation under this legislation if they do not get it right."	spk_23

He said the end of the year is when the review will be complete and that is useful to hear. I acknowledge that the legislation that we passed was, indeed, done on a cross-party basis and many of us banded together to facilitate the passing of that very important change in the law. However, as the Taoiseach acknowledged, there are still certain inadequacies, which could be addressed even pending the publication of the review. Geographic coverage and availability of services throughout the State, both through GPs and, indeed, hospitals, should be improved upon, even without awaiting the outcome of the review. I welcome the announcement the Taoiseach has made today on safe access zones, but it is somewhat overdue, given that we had sought those back in 2018. They were promised in late 2018 by the then Minister and we have been awaiting them since because women are still being intimidated in seeking to access services. While inadequacies remain and women cannot access services, locally, in their own area, we know that the legislation is still inadequate to meet the real needs of women.

Last week, I criticised the Government for having shoehorned five Bills into five hours on Wednesday afternoon. It is now proposing that six Bills be shoehorned into six hours tomorrow. Even worse, there are significant numbers of amendments to some of those Bills, including significant numbers of Government amendments. There are 73 amendments to the Electoral Reform Bill alone, yet only 45 minutes of debate planned.Most seriously, six major new sections have been added to the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, which will more than double the length of the Bill, from 18 pages to nearly 50, with 48 pages of amendments from the Minister. The Department of Housing under Fine Gael, supported by Fianna Fáil, created this crisis in An Bord Pleanála and the avalanche of judicial reviews when the strategic housing development process was brought in. Now, without pre-legislative scrutiny or the opportunity for Second Stage debate on these significant amendments to the judicial review process, we see all of these amendments coming into tomorrow's schedule when we have not had a chance for any scrutiny of these amendments in advance. We have serious questions about the process by which this Bill and these amendments in particular are being pushed through in tomorrow's schedule. We cannot support the Order of Business-----	spk_72

Media reports last weekend showed that a legislative loophole in rent pressure zone laws has enabled cuckoo funds to contribute to this problem, charging exorbitant rents, for example, €2,140 per month for a one-bed apartment and up to €5,220 per month for a three-bed.Until the Government reins these funds in, it is difficult to see the situation resolving itself.

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-07-12	dail	33	Confidence in Government: Motion	dbsect_19	This afternoon, the Government is asking us to vote confidence in it. We in Labour cannot do that. We have never had confidence in the Government to address the housing disaster, the childcare crisis, the spiralling cost of living or the climate catastrophe. In 2020, we did not support the election of the Taoiseach and we now believe in the need for a change of Government. We believe the project of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party has been unsuccessful. Despite their stated aims, they are simply not delivering the desired and necessary outcomes or results. Fianna Fáil has long professed itself the party of home ownership and of house building. Yet, since the Government took office, the housing crisis has deteriorated, rents have increased by 15%, house prices by 22% and homelessness by 19%, with more than 3,000 children and 1,300 families now homeless. That is without mentioning those who have homes but fear they will collapse due to mica, pyrite or construction defects. As the Fianna Fáil Minister for Health grapples with the two-tier health system his party ushered in alongside the Progressive Democrats, the promise of Sláintecare remains distant and, indeed, waiting lists remain unforgivably long for many basic services for many adults and children. Fine Gael finds itself similarly unequipped to deal with the challenges of its own portfolios. In the midst of an enormous cost-of-living crisis, the best the party can promise is a five-year wait for a living wage. After the trauma of the pandemic, it has produced a sick pay scheme that will cost lower-income workers money, and so-called flexible working legislation that empowers employers to say “No” - a right to refuse, not a right to remote work. The Green Party, a party that shares many policies and aspirations of my own, has managed to pass some climate legislation, which we have supported, but it appears it is incapable of pushing its Government colleagues to meet those legally-binding targets. We, therefore, see a stand-off on agriculture emissions and on peat and, all the while, the countdown to climate catastrophe keeps ticking. On childcare, the Government is bound to examine the introduction of a universal public scheme by the First 5 funding model, which is welcome, but that does not appear to be on the horizon, despite ongoing poverty wages for those working in the sector and exorbitant costs for parents. Inequality in Ireland starts the day a baby is born and that should not be how it is in a republic. This country deserves a Government with the imagination to do better; a Government that can be relied on to act in the common good for all its people, that will build affordable homes on public land, lead the charge on climate justice and a just transition, and bring about a new Donogh O’Malley moment to ensure universal public childcare and early years education for our youngest citizens and people; a Government that will ensure that nobody languishes on waiting lists for CAMHS, medical intervention, special classes or autism assessments; and a Government that treats care work with the respect it deserves and that will work for the unity of the island in the spirit of John and Pat Hume. Unfortunately, I remain unconvinced that the Government can deliver on any of that. We acknowledge the many challenges that the Government has and that we all have - the brutal war in Ukraine, the ongoing effects of the Covid pandemic and, of course, the spiralling cost of living. As inflation has skyrocketed, we know that individuals and families are struggling to put food in their mouths and roofs over their heads, but we also know that there are solutions to these complex problems and there is a way to address these challenges. We believe in a Labour vision, a constructive and alternative vision for change based on a centre-left, social democratic philosophy and set of principles, based on the introduction of key measures, such as genuinely free education, genuinely free childcare and early years education, windfall profit taxes on energy companies, immediate increases in the minimum wage and social welfare rates, a rent freeze and new measures to drastically reduce rents, and ensuring the building of more homes as a matter of urgency. We offer that alternative vision and we also offer a vision on climate justice and on just transition. Something that is notably absent from the no-confidence motion tabled by Sinn Féin is a mention of climate, and it is a strange omission. As climate spokesperson, I have certainly given the Green Party its due for the measures it has sought to introduce in government but we know its coalition partners are simply not willing to do what is necessary to ensure we address the real, existential climate crisis in climate and in biodiversity.	spk_297
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-07-12	dail	33	Confidence in Government: Motion	dbsect_19	We need a Government that will integrate economic planning with a stronger climate response to take us to net zero as quickly as possible, to make Ireland the renewables superpower that it can be and to support the creation of decent jobs through a just transition. There is a pressing case for change. The reality is that younger generations in Ireland are now growing up worse off than their parents who came before them. Young people are locked out, with no prospect of secure, affordable homes. Workers on low pay and in precarious conditions are struggling to get by, rather than getting on. We know Ireland needs a pay rise and we know the State can and must deliver a new social contract, with real change offered on housing, care, climate and more. We need to build an equal, sustainable island, contributing proudly to our European and international future, but we can only do this if those holding the levers of power understand that change cannot wait and if they are an ambitious enough to do more and do better in delivering tangible results. The tone of too much of this debate has been one of mock outrage and mock anger, which is not helpful. We in the Labour Party have sought to bring a constructive approach to Opposition and to put forward genuine alternatives to try to address the real challenges that all of us hear every day from our own constituents and from people across this island. We meet people struggling to make ends meet.We meet parents forced to become full-time campaigners for the basic rights of their children, particularly autistic children and those with a disability. Week in and week out, the sand is running out as we fail to tackle the climate disaster. My conviction is that the government we need is a government of the left - a government that understands the purpose of the State is to deliver for the common good of all and to harness State action to deliver on housing, childcare, early years education, healthcare and climate. That is not this Government.	spk_299
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-07-07	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_31	I want to raise again the issue of the housing crisis, the crisis that our President has described as a disaster. Yesterday's Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report has confirmed yet again the scale of failure over successive years to ensure that people have adequate homes and the right to a home. Since this Government assumed office, rents have increased by 15%, house prices have risen by 22% and homelessness has increased by 19%. There are outrageous numbers of individuals and families on the homeless list. There are over 3,000 children, 1,366 families and over 5,000 single people on the list. There is an unacceptable level of homelessness and poverty in Ireland, a relatively wealthy country in the EU, in 2022. The ESRI has confirmed to us that an impending crisis for older people renting is also facing us. Renters can barely cover the cost of rent, let alone save up to buy a home or save up for retirement. While the Government's current strategy is predicated on an assumption that rental is short-term and that people will somehow morph into homeowners by the time they retire, we know that can no longer be assumed. We know that failures to deliver on housing and housing supply now means that many people will be renting into older age and will be continuing to pay unaffordable rents. Indeed, in my own constituency and that of the Minister, Dublin Bay South, there is a much higher level of households in the private rental sector than in other constituencies across the country. It is a particular issue there, with over 40% of households in the Dublin Bay South constituency renting. I am receiving, as I am sure the Minister is, more and more communications from older people who can no longer afford their rents, who are facing eviction, or who simply cannot find a place, let alone an affordable place to rent. We have called for a radical shift in housing policy, for budget 2023 to deliver a drastic ramping-up of the building of social, affordable and cost-rental homes. We, and my colleague, Senator Moynihan, our housing spokesperson, have called for the Government to bring vacant homes back into use with a vacant property tax. Such a tax rate must also be accompanied by resources and proper enforcement measures. We need to see an increase in the percentage of Part V units for social and affordable housing. We have consistently called for a three-year rent freeze in order to see a reduction in evictions. That must be introduced. Targeted supports must also be provided for communities particularly at risk of homelessness. There must be an end to speculation and land hoarding. We need to see a referendum on the right to housing, something we have called for consistently. I ask the Minister to push, at Government level, to ensure that there is a radical shift in housing policy towards seeing a home as a right and towards delivering on a policy of reducing and eliminating homelessness in Ireland. Will the Minister push for that in budget 2023? It is an urgent issue for many households and families.	spk_198

In fact, in this case it is about the lack of delivery. What I am hearing from renters or those aspiring to own a home but who cannot do so, and indeed from people who are seeking to build homes to deliver on housing, is that there is a lack of delivery and urgency in delivery by Government. Certainly, very welcome measures have been announced by Government. However, what is so frustrating for people is that we have not seen the impact of those measures. There has been no outcome in terms of the supply of homes available to people who need them now. Each number on the homeless list represents a person who is looking for a home, but who cannot currently be housed and has not yet felt the impact of housing policies that have been announced. We have not seen the urgency and delivery of policies. We in Labour have sought to put forward constructive measures, such as our renters' rights Bill and Senator Moynihan's idea of a rent-to-buy scheme to convert rent paid on a property over three years into a deposit for a property for individuals. The measures we have proposed are constructive. We brought forward a homeless families Bill to prevent the risk of child poverty and child homelessness. We need to see more concerted action.

I met early this week with Friends of the Earth, which warned that any reduction in ambition in one sector would be the increase of targets for other sectors to impossible levels. Indeed, in the words of Professor Hannah Daly, implausible levels. In particular, we know that demands are being made by farming groups that agriculture’s target be no more than 22%. However, of course, this would have knock-on effects for other sectors, such as transport, energy and so on.

We saw a credit union survey this morning showing the cost per child being between €1,100 and €1,500. I spoke with a mother this morning who is budgeting for the school term ahead. She tells me that the cost of sending her two children to school this September has risen by €1,500 compared with this time last year. This is an enormous increase for any family. Amid rising costs of food, fuel, transport, childcare and housing, this price increase will have serious implications and ramifications for her household budget and the budgets of many households across the country. The credit unions told us that about one third of families go into debt to pay the cost of being back to school. The mother I spoke with joked that between the cost of returning to school and other rising costs, her credit union's loans department will be on speed dial for the rest of this year. There were welcome concessions from the Government on back-to-school costs last night but they are simply not enough. There was no radical move to introduce the free school books scheme that my colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, proposed. It would cost €40 million but would make a significant difference to many families. There was no move to increase eligibility for the back-to-school allowance, which could be done with the stroke of a pen and would make a real difference. There was no move for real reform of the outdated school transport system either. We need a bigger vision with more substantive change. We have called for a real cost-of-living budget, not one which will introduce mere piecemeal reform. We welcome the date being brought forward, but as my colleague, Deputy Nash, said, it is really a token exercise, because it has only been brought forward by two weeks. We have called for more targeted measures to be introduced now to ensure that families and households have excellent supports as they go through that critical time when children go back to school. Instead, we see suggestions that the Government will introduce vote-winning tax cuts at the expense of real cost-of-living measures to support hard-pressed families and households. Will the Minister avoid skirting round the edges and make real, substantive changes in the budget, based on a practical way of improving conditions for many families and households? We know the cost-of-living crisis is not an abstract concept. It is felt by households across the country, including households which had incomes which, this time last year, were sufficient and adequate to meet their household expenses and bills, yet they are now facing a desperate situation where they simply cannot afford and are dreading going back to school.	spk_62

This group needs additional supports to deal with the cost-of-living crisis and they need a pay rise. Ireland needs a pay rise generally. People need more money in their pockets at the end of the week in order that they can meet rising costs for many basic commodities, including housing. Will the Minister engage with section 39 organisations to ensure that their staff get a pay rise?Many of them have been doing much front-line work through the pandemic and continue to do so now but yet, they simply are not earning enough to meet the rising costs we are seeing as we come into the back-to-school season. 	spk_64

That is because over 200 children still do not have a school place on the last day in June for the coming September term. It was a privilege yesterday to be joined by parents, advocates, SNAs, teachers and young people for the debate on the Labour Party's Autism Bill 2022, which seeks to address the serious shortfall in provision for autistic people, both adults and children, who are simply without services. We heard words such as ""hellish"" and ""a nightmare"" used by parents when describing their experiences in securing services for their children. We have asked the Government to take urgent action on this. We were glad the Bill was not opposed yesterday on Second Stage. What we want is what children and adults in other jurisdictions have as a matter of right, which is a national autism strategy to address provision in education, healthcare, employment and training. We see it in Northern Ireland under the Autism Act 2011, in England under the Autism Act 2009 and in Malta which has a national autism empowerment strategy. My colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, has been calling for this for some time. Indeed, over a year ago, Labour Party Deputies put forward a motion to introduce a national autism empowerment strategy. We were promised action on that within a year by the Government and we accepted that response. We waited for longer than a year but, regrettably, over a year on we are still hearing the same experiences and frustrations. We saw this frustration expressed in the report of the Ombudsman for Children, a damning report of Government failures in regard to children. We do not believe that anybody in the Government thinks that a 36-month waiting list for an assessment or intervention is acceptable or that it is acceptable that over 15,000 children are being bussed out of their local communities to access an appropriate or acceptable education. We do not think it is acceptable that so many schools are lacking the wraparound additional supports that are needed to ensure a proper and adequate education for children with autism. In recent weeks we see news headlines still being dominated by a lack of provision and lack of school places. Worst of all, we see children who are still without a guarantee of a place in the autumn. I know the Government's legislation is to be debated tomorrow, but it is too little, too late for those children and their families. What we heard from the groups, advocates and parents who were with us yesterday in the Visitors Gallery was an urgent desire for the Government to take steps today to ensure that we are not back in the same place next year. What timeline does the Government have to ensure we are not back in this position next year? What timeline does it have for addressing the serious shortfalls in provision for children and adults who are lacking the basic human rights they should have just because they are autistic? Why are we still failing those children and adults?"	spk_96

In some cases they have had to approach 18 or 25 schools simply to try to get a place for their child and were still unable to do so. Many parents in my constituency, Dublin Bay South, are at the end of their tether trying to secure places. There is a pinch point at every stage - transition to primary school, transition into secondary school and leaving secondary school and going to college or training. At all these points parents have to fight so hard that it becomes a consuming exercise in activism for many of them. They should not have to fight for what should be basic rights for their children and young adults who are simply not getting the recognition and support they require in the State.

We know that costs of childcare for parents are far too high, wages for early years professionals are too low and there is an abject shortage of places for children. Across my constituency, I hear all the time from parents who are worn out from trying to find a crèche or early years education place or who have been told there is no preschool facility available for their child until 2024. We need a guarantee - a Donogh O'Malley moment - to ensure that every child will have a preschool and early years place available to him or her. I know the new core funding model was published this week but we need the Government to take meaningful steps to achieve a universal public childcare system. I ask the Tánaiste and the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to indicate what steps are being taken to guarantee every child will have an early years place when he or she needs it, every early years educator will get decent pay and parents will have affordable childcare available to them.	spk_110
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-06-29	dail	33	Autism Bill 2022: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_8	It gives me great pleasure to second this Bill on behalf of the Labour Party. I commend my colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, on speaking so passionately in proposing it. He has fought so hard for so long on the rights of children with autism in education. As he said, we are very glad to be joined today in the Public Gallery by many parents who have spent so long fighting for the rights of their children. I thank them very much for engaging with us. We appreciated the opportunity to learn from and speak to them this morning, especially parents in my constituency from the Involve Autism Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W group and the neurodiversity Dublin 4 group, in addition to parents from Clondalkin Autism Parents Support Network, Families Unite for Services and Support and Dublin 12. We are also glad to be joined by members of Inclusion Ireland and AsIAm. We are conscious there are advocacy groups, parents and individuals who have had to give up much of their time and, in many cases, paid work, to campaign and fight so hard for basic services and basic provision for their children. This morning we heard some very harrowing stories and experiences of parents. We heard about the frustration, as Deputy Ó Ríordáin said, and the exhaustion parents are experiencing. We heard the real fear and concern parents have at each one of the key points in their children's lives. These include the point at which they are due to go to primary school and may not be able to access appropriate places in their area, the point at which children move to secondary school where there is again a lack of available places in so many areas, and the point at which they age into adulthood at 18, when services are again lacking and concerns arise about adequacy and appropriateness of residential care and where, in fact, parents cannot access sufficient supports to keep children at home. We heard from parents who rightly want to see, as we all do, the potential of their children fully realised in education, further education and training, and in the workplace. There are some very disturbing statistics on the high levels of unemployment and low levels of jobs being taken up and being available to those with autism. It is not just children with autism. We are talking about adults with autism and children and adults with other additional needs. For their sake, and the sake of families and households everywhere, we ask for change. We ask the Government not just to accept our Bill - we are glad it is not being opposed on Second Stage - but to enable it to pass to the next Stage and into law. We want to see the Government, this State, and all of us collectively taking action to ensure a holistic strategy based on proper data, with proper planning for education, jobs, healthcare and other basic services to be available to those with autism and other needs, as we see in other states. We know of and we heard this morning about other countries and jurisdictions where services are available, sometimes in countries less wealthy than ours. On our neighbouring island, we see a better holistic approach being adopted, a national autism strategy, for example, and proper planning based on real and up-to-date data on levels of need across communities. That is what we are seeking in putting forward this legislation. As Deputy Ó Ríordáin said, we put this matter forward as a motion a year ago. We are now bringing it back as a Bill. We emphasise this is in response to the needs, desires and wishes of all those to whom we have spoken, whom we contact and whom we hear from every day. I will share some testimonies with the Minister of State from frustrated and deeply distressed parents. They have given me permission to share their testimonies on how their children with autism and other needs are currently being let down by our State. One mother of two children, a boy and a girl, who contacted me said:I am waiting 15 months so far for speech and language therapy for my four-year-old son. My little girl has also now received a diagnosis. Services are a nightmare. I have contacted 18 schools for my son for this coming September – nothing. I now know that I need to find a place for my little girl too. I am so scared.Another mother who contacted me said her 16-year-old has been without a suitable school place since she was in primary school. Her family was initially forced to accept an inappropriate place as that was all that was available and they now feel they have fallen off the radar. Another mother of a four-year-old girl contacted me to say her child's diagnosis was deemed “not complex enough” for the local children’s disability network team but too complex for other types of support. As a result, she is receiving barely any support at all. I have been contacted by many others, not just parents of children with autism but those who have children with other needs, who again lack sufficient access to services. One distressed mother whose three-year-old was referred to children’s disability services due to developmental delays described the “hell” she went through with the services since then and how she and her family are coping with a child who sleeps less than four hours every night, who has serious self-injury and safety concerns, and who had to have her head glued after headbutting herself so hard her hair clip pierced her skin. That family has spent their savings procuring private interventions to ensure they can get supports for their child. These are the testimonies, the real stories and experiences we are all hearing across our constituencies. The figures are not clear, but we understand that more than 200 children may be without a school place this September. According to a damning report published by Ombudsman for Children, in excess of 15,000 children and young people are forced to leave their communities to access education outside of their area because there is nothing available in their catchment. In my constituency, there are serious issues in Dublin 6, Dublin 6W and Dublin 4. Parents in Dublin 12, Dublin 15 and Clondalkin have also told us of their issues with getting appropriate school places. We understand there is immense frustration and that more needs to be done to ensure school places and other supports are available. Where school places are available, they must include access to the other services often needed. Often a complex range of services is required. Other supports, such as occupational therapy and speech and language therapy, need to be provided, ideally in a local setting. I know the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, are very aware of the level of need. We are all aware of the level of need. We want to see measures taken by Government to address that. Last April, Labour Party Deputies stood in this House and debated our motion to introduce a national autism empowerment strategy. The Government committed to taking action within a year. We accepted that response. Indeed, we have left it for longer than a year. More than a year has past since April 2021 and, regrettably, we are still hearing the same experiences and frustrations being expressed to us. Our headlines, even in the past week, continue to be dominated by stories of how many children with autism are not able to access places. The Ombudsman for Children, in his damning report, has highlighted the failures in provision. We are asking the Government to state that a difference will be made and to commit to making a difference where it counts. We are asking for holistic strategies and the systems that work elsewhere in other countries to be introduced here. We also ask for responsibility to be taken. One of the big challenges many of us face in addressing constituents' concerns and those expressed to us by families is establishing who will take responsibility for different issues that arise. That may involve seeking an early assessment for a child, or providing sensory-friendly rooms for adults in public buildings and for children in schools. I can think of one school in my constituency that has been pushing for the provision of adequate bathroom facilities to accommodate children who require particular support from special needs assistants, SNAs, It may be that basic facilities are required, such as the provision of extra space in bathrooms for SNAs. I pay tribute to the wonderful SNAs. Indeed, we have heard from many of them on this issue. There is a difficulty at a practical level in getting these supports and knowing who to approach for them. Our Bill proposes the adoption of a long-term strategy. That is essential. We also highlight the need for short-term and immediate intervention and action now. We know the Government has committed to some actions, but we need to see them speeded up and improved upon. We were here a year ago, proposing a constructive means to address the real difficulties, hardship and frustrations expressed by many to us. I reiterate to our guests in the Gallery the Labour Party's commitment to staying the course in this campaign. I know they will not give up. We will not give up either. We will continue to press from opposition, but we want to work constructively with Government to see that real and effective measures and strategies are introduced that will deliver real and necessary change to ensure children and adults with autism and other needs are enabled and supported to realise their full potential in society. Otherwise, our society is not inclusive and equal. We want to change that. That is why we are here today.	spk_23

While searching for a rented home, my constituent was invited to participate in what he described as a bidding war. The landlord was asking prospective tenants to indicate how much they were willing to pay per month in rent. I am not suggesting that is representative of all landlords by any means but this shocking example is a consequence of a broken housing system, a housing disaster as our President recently described it. My offices and those of my Labour Party colleagues are inundated with people looking for help with housing who cannot afford to get a home, who are languishing on the housing list, people facing eviction and rent increases, older people who are very frustrated because their adult children in their 20s and 30s cannot afford to move out of the parental home. Yesterday during Leaders' Questions, the Taoiseach invited me to provide suggestions from the Opposition. I am happy to give some.

We heard it from the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, which told us how calls to their helplines are up and, in particular, we heard it from Barnardos, which described to us in such shocking terms how so many families cannot afford decent clothes or shoes for their children, who are forced to buy open-toed shoes, sandals or flip-flops in the hope that those will last longer, and are simply unable to afford basic food. Everywhere we go we hear it. I heard from a constituent of mine in Dublin Bay South, an assistant manager in a restaurant, who told me he has started to pick up additional shifts in another restaurant, as well as shifts with a private home care provider, just to be able to keep on top of his rent and provide for his family. Another constituent on a good salary cannot find a place to rent and has now been invited to make bids in a bidding auction. The landlord is asking potential tenants to indicate what they are willing to pay because there are plenty of people who will pay more if they do not. Yesterday, my colleague, Senator Sherlock in the Dublin Central constituency, and I visited Brother Kevin and his team in the Capuchin Day Centre in the north inner city where we heard that they are seeing a shocking increase in the numbers of families coming in for the free dinner service. These are people who are working on low incomes and bike couriers working for companies like Deliveroo who are delivering food to others but are unable to afford food for themselves. That is the shocking reality. I heard the Taoiseach’s response to the earlier question and he is right about Putin’s brutal war in Ukraine, which has had a horrific knock-on effect, not only for all of the civilians who, even yesterday, have been so tragically killed in Ukraine, but also for all of us across Europe as we see the cost-of-living crisis deepen. The point, however, is that notwithstanding who caused the crisis, the response here is up to the Government. We have control of the response in this country. We are a country that is wealthy by European standards. We saw massive State intervention to deal with Covid-19. That public sector investment saw us pivot swiftly and well to deliver the pandemic unemployment payment, the wage support schemes and all the other measures that were introduced. We need to see that level of intervention now to address the cost-of-living crisis, whatever the cause, and acknowledge the very significant international causative factors. The response is within our control. The Labour Party has called for measures to be introduced urgently and swiftly to address the real concerns so many families and households face. In just six weeks’ time, the back-to-school crunch is coming when families will have to deal with buying school books. They are paying increased fuel costs and seeing the cost of basic food items such as bread and milk rising. There is a real fear around that. Even a small set of targeted measures introduced now, before the summer recess, would make a difference to the confidence of families and households that they will be able to face into the winter, in which we all know the cost-of-living crisis is only going to deepen and the real hardship I saw yesterday in the Capuchin centre is going to get even worse for families and individuals.	spk_21

We are prepared to sit beyond and through the summer if that is what it takes to deal with the sort of targeted measures that are necessary, such as a summer social welfare bonus that could be introduced as a targeted measure to alleviate the real hardships faced by those on low incomes. We are very much prepared to do this. We very much accept that measures have been taken by the Government. We also accept, of course, that the challenges with the cost-of-living crisis are different from those of Covid. What should be the same is the political will to deliver a strong State response and the type of creativity and ingenuity we saw in delivering the State's responses to Covid. This is the type of political will we need to see now in delivering measures that will alleviate hardship for families and households throughout the country. We support vastly increased investment in childcare. We have been calling for a Donogh O'Malley moment in childcare to ensure families will see a place guaranteed for each child in the country. This is essential. We know it will take some time. There are some targeted measures that could be introduced in the coming weeks that would help to alleviate the real hardship facing so many.	spk_23

I spoke earlier about the enormous pressure on people trying to find a new home when they have been evicted. We are seeing evictions at a record high. That is a very serious concern. I would also raise another concern about the ordering of business, which is just the huge number of Bills before this House and the other House. There are nine Bills in each House this week alone. This is a year after President Michael D. Higgins reportedly wrote to you, a Cheann Comhairle, that there were too many Bills being put by Government in the last few weeks of each term. He said that having this vital work concentrated into four weeks of the year struck him as being less than ideal and unnecessary and called for a more orderly approach to the ordering of legislation. We absolutely will support the waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny on important Bills and we have worked with Government on that but it is still not a good way to conduct legislative business. We need to see an end to this practice of last-minute legislation. We need to take account of the President’s concerns about rushed legislation.	spk_36

We appreciate the Government was left in the unenviable position of having to get this legislation through as quickly as possible to ensure EirGrid can legally procure the generators and have them in place. We understand EirGrid will then sell and transfer those to an electricity generator and enter into an operating agreement. What we must ask is why this Bill is being rapidly pushed through the Oireachtas at such a late stage in this term. I urge the Minister of State to address the question of how we find ourselves so exposed to supply shortages and why this legislation is only being brought through now. I raised during the Order of Business, as did colleagues, that it is not good legislative practice to see legislation, especially when it is complex, being rushed through in the last few weeks of the summer term without pre-legislative scrutiny and without being given the time that would usually be spent on considering it. My understanding is the CRU direction was issued on 7 June, the Bill was approved, I think the Minister of State said, by the Government on 14 June and a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny was granted on 21 June. This is an important and complex piece of law, designed to comply with EU energy rules, state aid law and procurement regulations and in a context, of which we are all conscious, that we may be facing an emergency in supply. We appreciate extra generation capacity cannot just be added in overnight but we believe this legislation could have been brought forward at an earlier date. If we go back to last autumn, significant questions were even then being asked about the prospect of the lights going out. That was before the war in Ukraine began and before the brutal invasion by Russia. Even then, concerns were raised about the tendering process for generating capacity. The current crisis cannot be blamed on the war in Ukraine alone or on the rapid increase in gas prices, although the brutal war has clearly exacerbated energy security and supply issues internationally. We also appreciate that the current crisis represents a failure of long-term planning in this country on the transition to renewable energy sources. Throughout last summer and into the autumn, the pressure on electricity supply grew due to the growing demands from data centres, which the House has debated, as well as the transition from dirtier fuels like coal and the balancing needed to support the generation of wind power. This was constantly highlighted even before the war on Ukraine began. We know 1 MW is considered enough to power 1,000 homes, so the capacity we are procuring is sufficient to power nearly 500,000 new houses and apartments. Considering only 33,000 or so units are likely to be built per year, if we generously assume 150,000 new homes are built over three years, that still leaves surplus capacity. Where will that energy go? There is no real transparency on this. This is another of the issues that arise. Some proportion of the new capacity will power new developments in the economy. The CRU stated in its announcement that these emergency measures were needed due to the increased risk of older generators becoming unavailable and ageing out. The older generators are also not as efficient as newer ones and have higher carbon emissions. However, we are concerned the measures will still lock in new fossil fuel generation capacity. The Minister of State might advise in his wrap-up speech if the announcement just last week of census figures showing record population growth, and the follow-on demands on housing, social services, workplaces and so on, have been factored into the proposed energy needs and planning for future winters. Another important question that arises, even after this emergency procurement measure, is whether a similar exercise will be required next year or the year after. Again, the issue of planning for future needs arises. This legislation is possible because it deems there to be a ""temporary electricity emergency"", but how do we do we know whether an emergency is likely to take place in 18 months' time? Indeed, if that is to be the case, when does it start and end? Once we go down the route of getting the transmission system operator to source emergency extra capacity, it will become the default option if the electricity generation market is not operating properly. A central question about these generators is what fuel they will run on. Again, there is a concern about enhancing our fossil fuel dependency. Will EirGrid be told what to procure? Another question is what will be the cost to the State of developing and running such generators. Reports say it will be recouped from customers over a three-year period. Is the State putting up the capital spend in the first place? The Minister of State might clarify where the €350 million of capital funding for these generators is coming from. According to the announcement, ""the Government [had] approved the necessary capital funding – in the order of €350 million for EirGrid"". That is where we see that figure. We are told that this will support and enable implementation of the initiative for winter of next year, 2023-24. Will the Minister of State indicate whether this is direct capital aid from his Department's budget or if it represents borrowing by EirGrid? If it is from the Exchequer, will the capital allocation for the Department be increased and, if not, are there projects that may remain unfunded due to the need for this funding? We need to hear from the Minister of State what the additional cost will be and if there will be an additional cost to households. This is happening at a time when energy companies are making extraordinary and unexpected profits due to the soaring prices of fossil fuels. The Labour Party has called for a windfall tax on excessive profits as a measure that could and should be included in budget 2023. The revenue raised could be used to fund additional climate mitigation and energy efficiency measures that would reduce further our reliance on energy imports at a time when we are seeing unprecedented insecurity of supply, largely due to the brutal Russian war. While we are rushing through this law so these new gas generators can be put in place this summer, it has not been adequately explained why the ESB, a publicly-owned company, previously pulled out of a contract to build a number of gas power plants. There has been extensive reporting in the  A significant concern I and my Labour Party colleagues have about this proposal, one that I have already mentioned, is that it will lock in more fossil fuel generation. Will the emergency plants be decommissioned after the winter of 2025-26? How will that impact on our climate emissions targets and our capacity to reach those targets by 2030? We know some less efficient generation may be replaced but is this in effect a way to quickly put in place extra capacity that renewables cannot deliver in the short to medium term? Does this amount to a tacit acceptance we cannot meet our targets? If so, that is obviously of immense concern. Again, is this new extra capacity really to allow for the development and operation of data centres? So many questions have been asked about data centres and their feasibility at a time when we are under such pressure to meet crucial emissions reduction targets. Friends of the Earth has asked a number of important questions about what alternative measures have been considered, such as demand-side management. Again, we have debated that issue in this House, including the question of imposing a moratorium on new data centres. I am aware that several Committee Stage amendments have been tabled on data centres and energy security and supply. I urge the Minister of State to give them serious consideration. We also ask that the social, economic and environmental impacts of the generators be carefully monitored. Will the Minister of State clarify how the placement, approval and licensing of these emergency power plants will be assessed? Another provision in the Bill is to increase the borrowing capacity of Bord na Móna to €650 million to support its brown to green transition. That is obviously a hugely important programme, although as a previous speaker noted, the reference to turf in the Bill is unfortunate. We might all agree on that, whatever our other views, especially considering the aim of the company is to move away from peat extraction. That move is very much to be welcomed but it would be useful for the Minister of State to outline what projects or investments this borrowing will support and give a commitment that a strategy from Bord na Móna will be presented to the Oireachtas joint committee. We have an opportunity in Bord na Móna to build out a national wind company and a national retrofitting company. This would be State-led development that would secure our energy transition and underpin a just transition.Regarding the public service obligation, PSO, levy, not all members of the public may be familiar with this levy on their electricity bills. It is set annually by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU. It appears as an €8.60 charge, before VAT, at the bottom of bimonthly bills. At present, the annual charge for households adds up to just over €56 a year after VAT. This came into effect in October 2021. The core purpose of the PSO levy was to support renewable energy, peat and security of energy supply plans. Generation from turf ended some time ago, however. My understanding of the CRU decision is that the increased wholesale price of electricity due to rising fossil fuel prices and the increased demand means that further collection of levies to support renewables are no longer immediately needed. I ask the Minister of State to address that point. Questions must be asked in respect of how successful the PSO has been in delivering on its objective of security of supply, given that the Bill has been introduced and we have been told its main purpose is to allow emergency procurement by the grid operator of sufficient supplies for the winter after next, with a secondary purpose being to refund PSO levies. The question remains as to what went wrong in the long-term planning if we are now seeing a reversal of the PSO programme. It was previously announced by the Government that the PSO would be set to zero from October, providing for a saving on bills. The Minister indicated this mechanism would be used to offset the carbon tax increase. However, for the first time, the CRU earlier this month issued a draft determination that there should be a refund. As the Minister of State outlined, section 12 of the Bill will provide for a refund of approximately €75. The Government is calling it a saving but it should not be forgotten that this is a refund of money people have already paid and, although the PSO levy will not have to be paid from this winter, families and households are paying for the cost of inaction. Essentially, households are paying for our collective failure to build sufficient renewable capacity, combined with our ever-growing reliance on imported gas for energy generation. This means households are paying for a lack of energy security through increased fossil fuel prices. Will the Minister of State, when wrapping up the debate, indicate his views on the future use of the PSO and whether it will be reapplied in future? I am conscious that I have asked a significant number of questions. I see the Minister of State is nodding. I do not need the full 20 minutes allocated to the Labour Party to point out that the Bill raises several critical questions for households who are already in fear. They are facing a winter when there will be real fears in respect of insecurity of supply and lights literally going off. To be fair, that is not just the case in Ireland, as this is an international crisis. However, many of us in opposition have been calling for the Government to adopt targeted measures in the form of a mini-budget or emergency budget. What is needed is a series of targeted measures to alleviate the hardship being faced by many households. This comes in a context where we in the Labour Party are saying Ireland needs a pay rise. Households need to have increased income in their pockets to meet the significant rises in the cost of living, of which the huge increases in energy bills are just one aspect. The Labour Party is conscious the prices of food, childcare and many necessary essentials for households are also rising. It is in that context that I am raising all these questions. They are fair questions to put as we debate the Bill. I will conclude on a point that is also in the context of the cost-of-living crisis faced by many households. The Labour Party is conscious the PSO is a fixed charge on households, irrespective of energy use or household income. That means those who use the least energy and those with the lowest income pay the same amount as others. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul pointed that out previously and called for a review of the application of the PSO to low-income and struggling energy customers. The Minister of State might consider that. We know from recent ESRI publications that one third of households are already in energy poverty. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has called for the introduction of social tariffs for energy supplies, a policy we in the Labour Party support. We again call on the Minister of State, and all Ministers across Government, to examine this serious issue of energy poverty as part of a comprehensive cost-of-living package, preferably this summer but certainly in the October budget. All present anticipate that substantial measures will need to be introduced in October if the Government does not move any sooner. The fear that already exists among many households in respect of the further hardship that will be caused by rising fuel and energy prices in winter is a serious issue. I know that is appreciated by all present. It is in that context I raise these questions on the Bill, its provisions, impact and purpose and the background to its introduction. It is unfortunate it is being brought through the Houses so speedily and without the pre-legislative scrutiny that, ideally, it should have undergone."	spk_224

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-06-23	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_25	Later this afternoon, my colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, will introduce Labour's autism Bill, which would create a coherent framework for addressing the needs of children with autism. The need for this sort of legislation has become patently clear in recent weeks and months. That need has been clear for a long time for the parents of children with autism who have been waiting for so long to see proper and effective provision made for their children. Last weekend, I had the pleasure of attending a training session involving Ranelagh Rockets, the brilliant initiative of the Ranelagh Gaels GAA club in my area which works with children with autism and provides one-on-one coaching. However, I heard there, as we have all heard throughout the country, about the immense anguish and frustration that many parents are experiencing because they cannot secure appropriate school places for their children and as a result of the immense delays involved. These issues were highlighted just this week in the report of the Ombudsman for Children, which indicates that the Department of Education is failing children with special educational needs. The ombudsman estimates that as many as 15,500 children have to travel outside their local catchment areas every day because there is nowhere available for them in their communities. We all know the parents. On RTÉ just yesterday, we heard the story of Gareth, a young boy from Athlone who is finishing primary school next week but who cannot secure a secondary school place near him because he is autistic. His mother, Michelle, spoke powerfully about the toll that this has taken on her child. He has stopped attending class altogether because he feels that there is just no point. He is not alone. Some estimates indicate that nearly 270 children in Ireland are without school places for this coming September. We know many more who are waiting for diagnostic assessments to allow them to qualify for school places in the first instance. We are approaching the end of the primary school year. We are approaching the end of June, and we are only beginning to hear now about processes being invoked by the Minister and the Government. The Ombudsman for Children's report was prompted by the actions of parents. The great group, Involve Autism D6 & D6W & Surrounds, is based in my constituency. Its chairperson, Miriam Kenny, has spoken out powerfully about how the group had to lodge a complaint with the ombudsman to get things moving. That complaint was lodged because of the lack of autism classroom places in Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W despite the existence of the section 37A process. It is simply not good enough for parents and children to hear that processes are now being invoked this late in the school year and to still lack any clarity or certainty about whether they will be able to attend school anywhere near where they live this September or whether they will be able to attend school at all. The Ombudsman for Children's report is clear that the current failures in the system amount to discrimination against children with special educational needs, especially those with autism. We know that other jurisdictions do so much better than us. They have proper planning in place and they know the numbers of places required. We are failing children. Is the Tánaiste in a position to give any clarification as to school places for those awaiting them?	spk_168

Again, however, this will be an immense source of frustration for parents who in so many cases have been forced to go public and to air private issues around their children in order to secure what should be the right of each child. It is simply not good enough to hear that the Attorney General's advice is being sought and that amendments of the section 37A process are being considered. This is too little, too late for those who are currently unclear as to whether their child will have a school place or even an appropriate school place for this September. Even where we see provision made, the lack of wraparound supports and the additional measures necessary is very evident. I had the pleasure of visiting St. Francis Special School in Portlaoise earlier this week. I heard about the need, even there, for the additional supports to be present. I am also conscious that with regard to special needs assistants, SNAs, the exceptional review process is simply not working as it should. I pay tribute to Fórsa's campaign to ensure decent recognition of the immensely important work that SNAs do in providing those additional supports. We are continuing to fail children because we cannot provide them with certainty and clarity about availability of school places and because of the immense delays in diagnosis in the first place.	spk_170

She tells me she has no life but is fighting to get it back by getting treatment. A huge obstacle she is facing in getting treatment for this awful disease is that she is on the housing assistance payment, HAP, and cannot find a rented home near the hospital where she is getting treatment. Hers is just one story of the difficulties so many people are having in securing accommodation where they are on HAP. Research from our Labour Party housing spokesperson, Senator Moynihan, has shown that just 182 homes across the whole of Ireland are available for single people on HAP. Threshold revealed today that four fifths of renters are struggling to find a home at all while 44% of those in rented accommodation fear their tenancy is insecure. We need to see greater and more urgent action from Government to address this difficulty and ensure that more homes are available for those on HAP and also to ensure that we see better provision made for those who are renting and those who are desperate to buy a home but cannot afford to do so.	spk_182

This is at a time when the President has rightly described us as having a housing disaster and has referred to our housing policy as a series of failures, which is a matter of real concern. We are all conscious that the Minister ordered an inquiry by Remy Farrell SC and that the six-week period within which the report is to be provided to him concludes at the end of this week. We are all concerned that we will not have time before the summer recess to see that report and to have a debate on it in this House.

These are working people who were previously on adequate incomes and they now say the cash simply is no longer there to meet their basic needs. That is why the Labour Party has called for immediate measures to be adopted by the Government. That is why the kite flying in recent days has not been helpful.

As a politician and civil rights campaigner, he leaves a tremendous legacy and had the extraordinary achievement of serving as Minister in both jurisdictions on this island. Reviewing the remarkable journey of Austin Currie's life and his strong legacy on peace and integration, one can only imagine what it must have been like for him at such a young age - 24 - to take a seat in the then unreformed Stormont Parliament, having won the 1964 by-election in East Tyrone. I cannot imagine what that was like. It was a time when there was blatant discrimination, including structural discrimination, against Catholics in Northern Ireland, particularly in the allocation of public housing, an issue that was to have a huge influence on his politics and his campaigning work. In 1968, the well-documented sit-in at the new council estate in Caledon shone a light for Austin Currie and all on the island on what was happening across Northern Ireland and brought much-increased public attention to the discrimination faced by Catholics and the political situation there. Speaking on the issue beforehand in Stormont, Austin Currie said those famous words, that all hell would break loose. They were prescient words because the fallout from that protest and that political context led to the formation of the Northern Ireland civil rights movement. Following that, as we saw, unfortunately, the terrible violence of the Troubles erupted and Austin went on to form the SDLP along with his colleagues Seamus Mallon, Gerry Fitt and John and Pat Hume. Like them, he was a man of peace who abhorred the violence of the Troubles and remained committed to non-violence, despite the enormous toll it took on his own family, with constant threats and over 30 attacks on his family home and family members, including on his beloved wife Annita. These things led him to move his family, ultimately, and take refuge in this jurisdiction, where he served as a Teachta Dála for many years and was to serve as Minister of State with responsibility for children in the rainbow coalition between 1994 and 1997. The Tánaiste has remarked how Niamh Bhreathnach, Labour Minister for Education in that coalition, paid tribute to his work on the rights of children. Another colleague of mine, former Labour leader Joan Burton, was a constituency colleague of Austin and shared with me the anecdote that when he first came to run for Fine Gael in Dublin West, Vincent Browne asked him about his knowledge of the geography of the constituency at a time when he would not have been an expert on that, to put it politely. Once elected, as Joan acknowledges, he became an expert on the highways and byways of Dublin West and developed a detailed mastery of constituency issues, remaining a Teachta Dála until 2002. As a Fine Gael candidate in the 1990 presidential election, he was extraordinarily generous to our successful Labour candidate, Mary Robinson, recommending transfers to her unstintingly right up until polling day. We remember him for that too. I pay tribute on behalf of Labour to Austin's family, to Annita and his children, Estelle, Caitríona, Dualta, Austin Óg and Emer, our Oireachtas colleague. I think I am the only Member here who has had the pleasure of serving with Emer, which I did in the Seanad until my by-election last summer. It was a pleasure to serve with her in the Upper House and to continue to work with her on the WorkEqual campaign and other campaigns in which we share a common interest. I express my condolences and those of Labour to the extended family, Austin's grandchildren, siblings, relatives and friends. May Austin rest in peace, knowing that his efforts helped to bring peace and reconciliation across this island.	spk_143
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-06-21	dail	33	Pre-European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_14	The barbaric imperial war of conquest against Ukraine by Putin's Russia is a challenge to which the EU is responding. The Taoiseach has given us a comprehensive update on the recent meeting of the European Council on 30 and 31 May. The Taoiseach has also spoken to us about the meeting of the European Council in Brussels later this week. I believe, and we in the Labour Party believe, that we need to see more and stronger actions being taken against Russia by the EU at this point. It is clear that we must continue to work hard to achieve a stronger set of sanctions against Russia. We have seen quite a number of different sanction packages but these have clearly not been enough to see an end to this brutal war. We must see stronger support for Ukraine both politically and financially. I very much welcome the Taoiseach's comments that Ukraine is now on a firm path to EU membership and that Ireland is supporting that path. We must also see stronger supports for those countries surrounding Ukraine, which are currently carrying the burden of the crisis caused by the Russian invasion, which is the crisis of refugees fleeing war and the brutality of the Russian invasion. We need to see more done at a political and diplomatic level. In this House and in protests outside the Russian Embassy I have consistently called for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador to Ireland. Let us see why we continue to have diplomatic relations with a country like Russia at all, a country that shows no remorse for its actions. It has engaged in a series of gruesome human rights abuses and a war of blatant territorial conquest. There are many unanswered questions about the size of the Russian diplomatic presence here in Ireland and its real purpose. Last week, the Netherlands uncovered a Russian spy trying to infiltrate the International Criminal Court, which is rightly investigating war crimes in Ukraine by Russia. The undercover back story, which we have seen in the newspapers here, of the GRU agent known as Victor Ferreira, involved four years of undergraduate study at Trinity College Dublin. If Ireland is being used as a training ground for Russian GRU agents then we need fuller disclosure. We need to know more about what the Government here knows about Russian activities in Ireland. We also need to see more action taken against Russian assets. Russian assets frozen in the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, should be committed to rebuilding Ukraine after its wanton destruction by the Russian army. My colleague, Deputy Howlin, has brought forward legislation in this House, the Proceeds of Crime (Gross Human Rights Abuses) Bill 2020, or the Magnitsky Bill, which passed Second Stage last December and which today is on Committee Stage. This legislation would empower our Government to take stronger action against Russian oligarchs and against those Russians guilty of war crimes. Mr. Bill Browder, the inspiration for this legislation, asked this morning in the Irish media, where was the speed and urgency for the progress into law of the Magnitsky Bill. I urge the Minister to fast-track its passage into law. We, as members of the UN Security Council, should be showing leadership in the international community in ensuring that the assets of those responsible for this brutal war may be seized in any jurisdiction in which they are held, including in Ireland. I very much welcome that the Government is supporting so strongly the candidate status for EU membership for Ukraine, but that will not be enough. We need to see stronger pledges of humanitarian and financial support for the people of Ukraine. I was glad to bring into this House members of the Ukrainian community in recent weeks, and in the past ten days to meet the Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland to hear directly from those most severely affected as to what is needed. Last week a survey of the Ukrainian community in Ireland was published as to the supports needed here around housing, childcare and after-school care. That is here in Ireland but we also need to see greater emphasis at EU level on the tariffs on Russian oil and gas to limit the financial benefit to Russia from rising prices of fuel internationally. I welcome what the EU has already done on Russian fossil fuels, but we also need to see stronger action taken and more urgently. This would also raise revenue for the EU to use in support of Ukraine. Of course, we know that the Russian action in this brutal war has been a major factor in the rise in inflation rates. These are causing major stress, trauma and pain to households in Ireland and across the EU, as we see stark rises in the cost of living and stark rises in fuel prices and food prices. Again, we see Russia using and weaponising grain and food produced in Ukraine in an attempt to destabilise European countries and countries worldwide. We are all very conscious of the impact this is having, particularly across the developing world. What can we do? Since last November we have called on the Government to secure key derogations on VAT rules on heating to try to ameliorate the really terrible impact that rising fuel prices are having here in Ireland. We also need to see, and we need to ensure, that stronger action is taken at EU level to secure an embargo on Russian oil and gas. That is crucial in order to see an end to this brutal war.	spk_152
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-06-21	dail	33	Proposal for a Directive on Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence: Motion	dbsect_15	"I am glad to speak for Labour in the debate on this opt-in and I welcome the opportunity to do so. As we know, it has now been just over three months since the Commission published the proposal for a directive on combating violence against women and domestic violence. That was on International Women's Day and, of course, it is now midsummer. It is very welcome to see this proposal. Preparations have been extensive and have included stakeholder consultation and a detailed impact assessment report. The purpose of the initiative to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence is to combat sexual, domestic and gender-based violence, to ensure the effective prevention of such violence and to ensure that sexual harassment and cyberviolence with cross-border dimensions are addressed effectively. What is most remarkable is that, as the Minister has said herself, there is no EU legislation that comprehensively addresses gender-based violence and domestic violence and that this directive will be the first to address specifically this type of violence. It is remarkable that is still the case in 2022. I suppose it reflects the reality that, for a long time, domestic violence was not taken as seriously as other forms of violence within the criminal justice system not just in Ireland but elsewhere. Many of us who have practised criminal law over the years will recall phrases like ""It was just a domestic"" being used to belittle or diminish the significance of the harm caused. I have worked for years with Women's Aid, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, Safe Ireland and other great organisations on the front line that are providing services for survivors and victims. When speaking with survivors and victims, it is evident that, for far too long, there has been a culture in which violence against women and children in the home has been essentially tolerated and certainly not tackled with the urgency required. In recent years, with the #MeToo movement and the move against sexual harassment with the horrific murder of Ashling Murphy and the outcry around the country earlier this year, we have seen an understanding and a renewed intent to ensure that this sort of violence will be addressed effectively. Measures have been taken. I am thinking of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 and the Domestic Violence Act 2018. These were major reforming legislation. We also passed legislation to criminalise female genital mutilation on foot of a Private Member's Bill I brought forward. All of these things were done in the last few years and have greatly improved the position of survivors. I am proud to be the chairperson of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality. I am grateful to the Minister for her engagement with the committee, particularly on recommendations 37 to 41 of the citizens' assembly, which seek to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. The assembly recommended that, among other things, all Government action to prevent such violence should be co-ordinated by a Cabinet Minister with direct responsibility for a national strategy. It is therefore very welcome indeed that the Minister has taken that on and is that Cabinet Minister. Of course, we are very anxious to see the publication of the imminent third national strategy, which has been promised for some months. We had hoped it would be with our committee in March or April so that we would be able to review it. We certainly hope it will be published imminently. The Minister might be able to say precisely when because, clearly, it is crucial if we are to build on the other improvements and measures. I acknowledge the welcome that stakeholders have given to Supporting A Victim's Journey and to other initiatives like the Still Here campaign the Minister referenced. However, we need to see the publication of that strategy and the resourcing and funding of refuges. All of us are very conscious that there are nine counties in Ireland where there is no refuge. Everywhere in the country I have been in recent months, I have heard about the scarcity of places and resources for those seeking to flee violence in the home. The other question we all have to ask in a debate like this is a more fundamental question about tackling a culture in which it is still the women and children who typically have to flee the home while the perpetrators of so-called domestic violence remain there. I recall a justice committee hearing on domestic violence many years ago where a survivor disclosed the abuse he had suffered as a child and asked in anguish why it was that women and children were still forced to flee and why we could not see the perpetrator removed from the home. That would require a fundamental shift in culture but it is necessary. We met today with an Australian Labor adviser, Stephen Donnelly. He told us about the emphasis Labor in the state of Victoria puts on violence in the home. They call it family violence rather than domestic violence to emphasise the more human side of it and that this is violence of the most intimate nature perpetrated within the home and usually within the family. The key message Labor had to tackle this was that, if this sort of violence was perpetrated against women and children by strange men, there would be an urgent, immediate and effective set of measures implemented to tackle it and stop it happening. The Minister spoke about zero tolerance. I entirely agree with her. We must bring a zero-tolerance approach to bear and see this as the deeply harmful and deeply destructive behaviour that it is. We must move swiftly to see the publication of the national strategy and measures taken to address this horrific sort of violence against women and children."	spk_193
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-06-15	dail	33	Energy Security: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	"In 2019 this House declared a climate emergency. Last year we passed legislation to keep oil and gas in the ground through the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act although it did not apply to existing exploration licences. That Act commits us to a legally binding path to net zero by 2050. Later today we will debate the annual transition statements. We are waiting on the Government's sectoral target ceilings. Here in Ireland, the Government is not acting quickly enough and we know that globally swift enough action is not being taken. Four critical climate indicators broke records last year: greenhouse gas concentrations, sea level rises, ocean heat, and ocean acidification. Extreme weather events with record heatwaves and extended droughts across the world amount to dangerous warning signs that urgent action is needed. Real and urgent action is required in Ireland to reduce our emissions. We know how far offtrack Ireland is and the recent Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, report tells us this. As red greens we in Labour believe that Ireland must, as quickly as possible, develop our renewable energy resources and future-proof our society from reliance on fossil fuels and that is the appropriate path to take, not the promotion of extraction of new oil and gas. That is why the Labour Party cannot support this motion. We believe there must be a just transition to meet the necessary climate targets to which we have signed up. Rarely do we see a Private Members' motion in this House that could have been written by a private company engaged in oil exploration. The motion before us wilfully ignores the overwhelming evidence that we – all of us on this planet - must wean ourselves off fossil fuels as quickly as possible. Drilling in the Irish Sea is not a short- or even medium-term solution to the current cost of living crisis, the rising prices of fuel, or the very valid concerns about energy security. The horrific war in Ukraine, waged by Putin, is a wake-up call for Europe on our dependency on Russian fossil fuels and the urgent need to decarbonise. It is not credible to argue now is the time to restart the long-term exploration and exploitation of fossil fuels in Irish waters. Let us not forget that this motion is not about oil that is sitting there ready to be extracted as though a tap can be turned on. Were it to proceed, it would be many years, if at all, before any fuel might be extracted, even if that were desirable or appropriate. Providence Resources wants to be granted a ""lease undertaking license"" so as to drill an appraisal well in the Barryroe oil field. If it was granted, reports say it would then have to begin raising $65 million to finance that well. According to the company, even if everything worked out production would only begin from mid-2026. This optimistic scenario from the company’s point of view still offers no immediate or even medium-term benefits for our energy security. Therefore, even if we leave aside the huge climate issue, which we cannot do, if licences were granted it is really difficult to see how it would benefit energy security. The motion also neglects to mention that several attempts were made to find a commercial field at Barryroe in the 1970s. The motion makes various other statements that are simply not credible including ""that indigenous energy sources create less environmental impact."" Let us be clear: developing new offshore oil wells in Irish waters would have a massive and potentially devastating environmental impact. The solution is not to do more damage, but to mitigate, reduce and repair the environmental harm already caused to our planet through our massive over-reliance on fossil fuels. Only yesterday, the UN Secretary General, António Guterres, was crystal clear when referring to western countries, saying new funding for fossil oil exploration and production infrastructure is delusional and would worsen the global problems of pollution and climate change. That is really clear. Only May last year, the International Energy Agency, IEA, reported that we must stop all new oil and gas exploration projects if global warming was to be limited to 1.5°C above pre-industrial level target. This scenario can only be achieved with massive investment in low carbon and renewable technologies. The IEA’s road map for net zero by 2050 makes clear that we need to expand our clean energy supplies rather than doubling down on fossil fuels as this motion would have us believe. Let me quote directly from the IEA roadmap report:Beyond projects already committed as of 2021, there are no new oil and gas fields approved for development in our pathway... The unwavering policy focus on climate change in the net zero pathway results in a sharp decline in fossil fuel demand, meaning that the focus for oil and gas producers switches entirely to output – and emissions reductions – from the operation of existing assets.The report is clear that pursuing offshore oil wells now would go against all international advice and all plans needed to address climate change in any real and substantial way. It is also the case when we look at our national research. Research from University College Cork shows that as we decarbonise, it creates significant risks of stranded fossil fuel assets. Again the motion does not take cognisance of this. It is another reason why we should not be encouraging more oil development. Instead we need to support a just transition which does not lock in the wrong sort of investment but looks to invest in renewables, the generation of clean energy and in the job creation that will accompany that. What Ireland can, and we in Labour say it must do, is to ramp up our efforts to build the offshore wind infrastructure we so badly need and invest in active and sustainable travel measures including cycling infrastructure which is woefully inadequate across our cities and the country. We need to retrofit our building stock and provide better supports for those who are keen to engage in retrofitting of their own homes and we need to use new battery technologies and invest in solar energy. Ireland is now a member of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance and we need to be leaders in advancing a fossil-free future. The crisis in world energy markets as a result of the brutal war in Ukraine has told us it is important to stop using oil and our reliance on fossil fuels as quickly as possible. That is reflected in the Minister’s amendment and in many of the other amendments. Indeed, the Minister’s amendment does address key points but it does not go far enough. It does not give sufficient clarity on the timeline for getting us to the point where we can meet our targets and finally get to the enhanced production of clean, green energy and renewables. There has consistently been slippage in the meeting of our targets. The EPA has made that clear. A lack of urgency has characterised the Government response and a lack of sufficient supports to enable people to move to meeting targets. On EV charging points and retrofitting we are seeing a lack of sufficient supports and resources. This means there is a risk that we remain a climate laggard and that we will simply be unable to develop our offshore wind generation capacity and our renewable capacity at sufficient speed. Finally, I want to raise again the urgent need to speed up the adoption of measures to reduce the reliance of the EU on Russian oil and gas. We in the Labour Party have called for a full embargo on Russian fuels. I welcome the action taken at EU level on oil but we need to do more on gas. New oil and gas wells here or elsewhere are not the solution. Rather we need an urgent, just transition to renewable energy, greater investment in energy efficiency and the development of a green hydrogen strategy. We in Ireland can be world leaders in this. This motion would take us backwards."	spk_48
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-06-15	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	"Every week I hear, as I know we all do, from constituents in my constituency in Dublin Bay South about the immense difficulties they face in finding a home and getting support with housing. I hear from renters who are looking at unaffordable rents - rents are as high as €4,000 per month for a house in my area - and renters who are facing eviction and cannot find another affordable home to rent. I hear from young couples and individuals who cannot afford, or even aspire to afford, to buy their own homes. This immense cost of housing is clearly contributing vastly to the cost-of-living crisis being faced across the country. Yet, at the weekend, the Minister for Finance warned that there are limits to what the Government will do to ease the cost-of-living crisis. The pandemic has shown us that State intervention is the art of the possible and State investment and public intervention on housing and the cost-of-living crisis should now be a priority. It is very disappointing to see the lack of action in this regard from the Government. It is no wonder that President Michael D. Higgins has described the housing situation as a housing ""disaster"". It is no wonder the President is referring to failures in Government policy. It is deeply concerning in this context to see kite-flying from members of the Government about tax cuts being the priority, rather than the priority of spending on housing, childcare and public services such as schools and hospitals and on addressing what the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has rightly called the ""social wage"" measures. Yesterday in the Seanad, we saw a disappointing indication from Government Senators who qualified their ambition for affordable public services with proposals on tax cuts. That is not what is needed. What we in the Labour Party have called for is a pay rise across public and private sectors to enable working families and individuals to see actual increases in their take-home pay and to see reductions in the costs they are facing in housing, childcare and health and proper Government investment in supports for people that will address the cost-of-living crisis and deliver housing to address the housing disaster we face. Pay increases are needed for the public and private sectors. I welcome the public sector pay talks that are ongoing. Being conscious that under the current pay agreement, workers are due to receive a 1% pay increase in October, with inflation now standing at 8%, this amounts to an effective pay cut for hardworking people. I know that is understood and it is why the pay talks are under way. I urge the Minister and Government members to take a generous approach to these talks, resist the conservative instinct not to be ambitious and not to trust people to spend wisely and take up the challenge and opportunity to see real investment in social wage measures, in childcare to ensure an equal early start for every child and in education and healthcare to reduce the enormous costs that are coming out of people's pay packets every week."	spk_94
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-06-15	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	I thank the Minister. The Labour Party certainly believes in constructive and responsible opposition but we are a party of the left. We believe in the need to ensure investment in public services for all. We do not believe in tax cuts for some at the expense of public services for all. That is our concern. Our concern is that during the pandemic we saw, rightly, the State stepping up to deliver investment. We need to see that level of ambition now in addressing the housing crisis and cost-of-living crisis. We have welcomed some Government measures but we have also been critical, rightly, when they do not go far enough. For example, the Government's Sick Leave Bill 2021 will leave low-paid workers out of pocket and its flexible work legislation essentially offers employers a right to refuse flexible work options. While we welcomed the Government's proposals on the living wage, they do not go as far as the Labour Party's Bill. Our concern is that people have no more to give. I express solidarity with the striking Bausch + Lomb workers in Waterford. One striking worker there stated that this winter they will be forced to leave the heat off and put on an extra jumper. They are seeking a pay rise to tide them and their families over. The Government is simply not ambitious enough to deliver the real solutions that are needed to address the cost-of-living crisis for those workers and others.	spk_96

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-06-15	dail	33	Ceisteanna ar Pholasaí nó ar Reachtaíocht – Questions on Policy or Legislation	dbsect_10	I raise the issue of the failure to deliver progress on Ireland's climate action plan in 2021. Among the more than 100 measures on which we did not see delivery on time was the move to ensure sufficient availability of electric vehicle, EV, charging points for those who wish to switch to EVs. This is being raised with me constantly in my constituency and it is an issue for many people around the country. Many who wish to switch to an EV cannot be facilitated in doing so because of the lack of publicly accessible charging facilities. We do not see any sign of urgency in the Government's response to this in the roll-out of a national strategy, or, indeed, at local level in Dublin City Council, DCC, and other councils. We must see urgency. We need to see the Government ramping up the installation of public charging points in urban and rural areas to enable the switch to EVs. We must also see more urgency in the switch to active transport measures. I raised before - I know the Minister is personally supportive of it - my idea of a bike-to-school scheme and the incentivisation of the purchase of bicycles for schoolchildren to encourage more cycling. It would be similar to the bike-to-work scheme.	spk_156
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-06-15	dail	33	Annual Transition Statement: Statements	dbsect_13	I welcome the opportunity to debate climate action and discuss the interdepartmental negotiations on sectoral targets. We know that the deadline is drawing ever close as weeks pass coming up to the end of this term in mid-July. Our global climate and biodiversity crises are existential and fundamental to our capacity to live and to the survival of our planet, but it is not all doom and gloom and we should never feel powerless. That is always an important message. We must ensure that there is always some optimism and grounds for hope. Resisting despair does not mean ignoring the alarm bells, however. Consecutive reports of the EPA and IPCC have provided us with a chilling prognosis but also a reminder that action is still possible to avoid a climate catastrophe. We have many of the solutions before us. Every day and every year we see positive changes with growing understanding of how we can roll out renewables, develop offshore wind energy and so on. From agriculture to transport, we know what we have to do. Today we reiterate our call for urgent action to be taken to ensure that we meet our ambitious but necessary climate targets. The first Bill I published when I was first elected to the Oireachtas 15 years ago, in the Seanad which seems a long time ago in some ways, sought to impose a cap on Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions. It was the first Bill of its kind in Ireland. Although that took place relatively recently, it seems a lifetime ago in terms of understanding the urgent need for action to combat the crisis. Even 15 years ago, there was none of that sense of urgency at international level and there was a great deal more climate denial both here and elsewhere. It is good that we are today in a place where sectoral caps are being made a reality and there is far greater consensus on the science of climate change and the necessity to move swiftly to avoid catastrophe. The IPCC is clear that we are currently on a path to exceed 2°C warming worldwide, which could result in enormous loss of life, livelihoods, biodiversity and food security. We hear chilling reports of the loss of species which is a wake-up call. This debate today must serve to refocus our energy on the urgent need to ramp up drastic climate action and to call for more urgency from Government. I will not waste this opportunity to express my frustration at continued attempts by some Members of the Opposition to derail climate action in Ireland. We saw the most recent occurrence of that in the House this morning when we debated a backward-looking, regressive motion on fossil fuels which the Labour Party is opposing along with others. I am glad that this is a more constructive debate this afternoon. I am glad we will have sight of the Government’s sectoral pollution targets for electricity, transport, buildings, industry and agriculture before the Dáil breaks for its recess in July. However, I again express my frustration that, as was the situation before Christmas, we are right up against the deadline of a recess when it comes to scrutinising these important measures. We saw this before Christmas with the long delays leading eventually to publication of the annexe to the climate action plan that I and many others had been looking for to enable us to have more time prior to the break. I hope we will not see a repeat of the delays of the past and I look forward to engaging further with the Minister of State and his Department on this in the coming month. Can the Minister of State provide a commitment that we will see this announcement made in a timely fashion and not just in the last week of the term? In the spirit of constructive engagement, I ask that an open line of communication is maintained with Opposition politicians and other stakeholders in the NGO sector such as Friends of the Earth, even when the Dáil is in recess.  Since our overall limits for the decade to 2030 were passed by the Dáil in April, I am very grateful to activists, NGOs and others for commentary and support. During that debate in April, I noted the degree of back-loading of our reductions between 2025 and 2030. It underlines the need to ensure that between now and 2025, we meet those more moderate targets. The IPCC has been very clear that a small window of three years exists to meet those necessary targets and avoid disaster. During negotiations of our sectoral emissions, there must be an understanding that we are dealing not so much with targets but, more accurately, a floor beneath which we cannot fall. It would be morally unconscionable to pass the clear tipping points the IPCC has identified, which would trigger larger scale changes in Earth's systems and a loss of biodiversity. We know that only in the event that every sector meets the upper end of the ranges published last November will we meet the overall target in the climate law. The concern is that we are not currently on target to achieve this. For example, we understand from recent media commentary that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is under intense pressure not to agree to pollution cuts of more than 22%. We need to be careful about all sectors meeting the relevant targets. The just transition that we in the Labour Party, as red greens, are calling for requires that those who are being asked to make the most onerous changes are aided and supported in doing so. In advance of the final publication of overall objectives later in the year, I ask that the Minister of State consider the questions asked by Friends of the Earth: Will the sectoral ceilings add up to no more than the national carbon budget passed by this House previously? Will the sectoral ceilings align with our 51% emissions reduction target for 2030? Will every sector do its fair share to reduce emissions or are other sectors being penalised for the foot-dragging of others? Will the Government ensure that any contingency fund of unallocated emissions budget is only used for sectors that are doing everything possible to cut emissions? We seek to offer constructive Opposition. We support the ambitious but necessary climate targets and look to stand with the Government and all of those who wish to work seriously and genuinely and to engage on the necessary actions to achieve the survival of our planet. We want to stand together and work together to ensure that we do right by people in Ireland, not only of our generation but generations to come. We need to ensure that we do so by meeting our targets and working together collectively. In that spirit I thank the Minister of State and his officials for engaging with us in this debate but I hope we will see further engagement outside of this House and beyond July. I really look forward to seeing the publication of measures before the end of this term.	spk_216

I condemn yesterday's action by the British Government in moving to publish legislation to undermine the Northern Ireland protocol. The legislation clearly amounts to a breach of international law. We have all seen that the introduction of the Bill is already damaging the relationship between Britain and the EU. It is a reckless and dangerous approach to a sensitive issue and it has the potential to undermine seriously the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process. Where compromise and trust are needed, we instead see the British Government opting to ratchet up tensions by pursuing unilateral action and ignoring its international obligations. In effect, we are seeing Johnson's Government acting like a rogue state. It is as if Donald Trump had moved into No. 10 Downing Street. This is clearly a matter of immense concern to all of us and, notably, it will have the most difficult and devastating effect on the people of Northern Ireland, who, as we see, are being used, in effect, by the Tory Government as a proxy in its own internal battle. As Tony Connelly of RTÉ put it, ""Boris Johnson has courted the hard-line European Research Group (ERG) to try to cling to his position"", and we are now seeing the Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, seeking to do the same in an internal Tory battle for power. This is no way to do business. We are all agreed on that. The path the British Government is pursuing will cause economic uncertainty, hinder the potential for growth in Northern Ireland and, as I have said, risks setting back and undermining the hard-won peace process.It is not too late to call for a return to constructive talks with the EU. I met last week with the leader of the Opposition in Britain, Keir Starmer, as did the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney. I put it to him that to proceed with this reckless and dangerous legislation is unconscionable. Mr. Starmer has put that in clear terms himself. Yesterday, we also saw a cross-party grouping of MLAs in the Northern Ireland Assembly write to Prime Minister Johnson. That group of MLAs represents the majority of voters in Northern Ireland who support collaboration and continued operation of the protocol. Their message is that the Johnson Government must end the charade that its actions are somehow being undertaken to protect the Good Friday Agreement. We know that is not the case and the Taoiseach has been clear on this too. Those MLAs have called, as we do, for engagement by the British Government with the EU in further negotiation and for honesty about the inevitable consequences of this British Government's unilateral action.

One of the most alarming things about this development is the breakdown in trust between the Governments across the islands and the breakdown in trust in the relationship between the British Government and EU negotiators. As the Taoiseach said, Maroš Šefčovič and his team are seeking to negotiate in good faith. There is now a dawning realisation across the EU that the British Government is not negotiating in good faith and has broken trust. That is why I do not use the comparison with Donald Trump lightly. We saw his regime tearing up international agreements and breaking trust with those with whom international treaties had negotiated, to the detriment of the peace and prosperity of his people. Unfortunately, we are seeing the same development with the British Government's breach of trust. We in the Labour Party, as proud Europeans and members of the Party of European Socialists, look to support the Government and the efforts of the EU to engage in constructive negotiation, find the sort of constructive solutions to any issues facing communities and businesses in Northern Ireland and ensure that we do not see any support for the Tory government's breaking of trust in this international arena.	spk_10

There has been positive change in recent years, notably, among other legislation, the Domestic Violence Act 2018 and the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020.

In previous weeks, I invited members of the Ukrainian Action in Ireland group to meet with the leaders and Whips of other groupings in the Oireachtas. I commend all the voluntary actions being taken, including, for example, the opening of a new support hub for Ukrainians in Vicar Street, Dublin 8 at the weekend and the provision of free bicycles to Ukrainian refugees by Paul McQuaid of River Cycles in Usher's Island, also in Dublin 8. These and many other examples of voluntary activity around the country to support Ukrainians are hugely welcome. The ambassador conveyed to me her thanks to Ireland for the huge support we have given to Ukrainians fleeing war but expressed concern about accommodation and that the Ukrainian adults who come here wish to engage in paid employment. To facilitate them in doing so, we need to ensure there is adequate provision not only of school places but also of childcare. I undertook to raise those issues.

How can we use our position on the UN Security Council to find solutions to the Russian embargo on Ukrainian grain exports, while being conscious that Russia is clearly weaponising food production in Ukraine? I also wish to ask about our position on the TRIPS waiver, given that the WTO ministerial conference is taking place in Geneva now. I am conscious that Oxfam Ireland has urged the Tánaiste to use his position on the WTO's foreign affairs council to advocate for a full TRIPS waiver to facilitate the local production of Covid-19 vaccines, treatments and tests in lower- and middle-income countries. Will Ireland support a full TRIPS waiver to end global Covid-19 vaccine inequality? Will Ireland advocate this week at the WTO ministerial conference for the EU to support such a waiver?  In Ireland, 81% of people had two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, compared to only 14% of people in lower-income countries. Nearly 30,000 people worldwide have died every day from Covid since the TRIPS waiver was first proposed, the majority in low-income countries. I am conscious of the immense devastation Covid has caused here, with reports growing of long Covid and a lack of treatments for people suffering from it. However, I am also conscious, as all of us are, that the implications and impact have been so much worse from those who suffered from Covid in low-income countries without the same access to vaccines and treatments that we in the developed world and, in particular, in the EU have had.

I join him in expressing solidarity with the people of Ukraine and support for its speedy accession to the Union. I met last week with the Ukrainian ambassador, Ms Gerasko Larysa, in Leinster House. In previous weeks, I invited members of the Ukrainian Action in Ireland group to meet with the leaders and Whips of other groupings in the Oireachtas. I commend all the voluntary actions being taken, including, for example, the opening of a new support hub for Ukrainians in Vicar Street, Dublin 8 at the weekend and the provision of free bicycles to Ukrainian refugees by Paul McQuaid of River Cycles in Usher's Island, also in Dublin 8. These and many other examples of voluntary activity around the country to support Ukrainians are hugely welcome. The ambassador conveyed to me her thanks to Ireland for the huge support we have given to Ukrainians fleeing war but expressed concern about accommodation and that the Ukrainian adults who come here wish to engage in paid employment. To facilitate them in doing so, we need to ensure there is adequate provision not only of school places but also of childcare. I undertook to raise those issues. I once again express my condemnation of the horrific Russian war and the appalling breaches of international rules of war, including the filtration camps about which we are now hearing. We must all condemn the unspeakable horrors that are being visited on the people of Ukraine.	spk_156

What additional aid will Ireland commit to the growing food crisis in the global south? How can we use our position on the UN Security Council to find solutions to the Russian embargo on Ukrainian grain exports, while being conscious that Russia is clearly weaponising food production in Ukraine? I also wish to ask about our position on the TRIPS waiver, given that the WTO ministerial conference is taking place in Geneva now. I am conscious that Oxfam Ireland has urged the Tánaiste to use his position on the WTO's foreign affairs council to advocate for a full TRIPS waiver to facilitate the local production of Covid-19 vaccines, treatments and tests in lower- and middle-income countries. Will Ireland support a full TRIPS waiver to end global Covid-19 vaccine inequality? Will Ireland advocate this week at the WTO ministerial conference for the EU to support such a waiver?  In Ireland, 81% of people had two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, compared to only 14% of people in lower-income countries. Nearly 30,000 people worldwide have died every day from Covid since the TRIPS waiver was first proposed, the majority in low-income countries. I am conscious of the immense devastation Covid has caused here, with reports growing of long Covid and a lack of treatments for people suffering from it. However, I am also conscious, as all of us are, that the implications and impact have been so much worse from those who suffered from Covid in low-income countries without the same access to vaccines and treatments that we in the developed world and, in particular, in the EU have had. Can we support a full TRIPS waiver?	spk_173

One of the five areas on which NESC is strategically advising the Taoiseach is aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic. We are all conscious that a lack of hospital bed capacity was one of the key reasons our lockdowns had to be so extensive in order to protect bed capacity in hospitals. We see reports that the emergency department in Our Lady’s Hospital, Navan, is to be closed. Has sufficient capacity been put in place in Drogheda hospital to ensure we do not see the repeat of the overcrowding we have seen in University Hospital Limerick, which I heard about on a recent visit?  Last week in my constituency, I heard from a constituent who told me of their family member’s experience in St. Vincent’s University Hospital where the person had to sit on a chair for two days while enduring the agony of appendicitis. Another person contacted my office last month about a relative who was suffering with early symptoms of sepsis having developed blood poisoning, and who sat in a chair into the early hours of the morning semi-lucid and propped upright against a wall. It is a reasonable expectation for those people and their relatives that hospitals would be able to provide beds to every patient in need of care.

We are very disappointed that the Government did not support the proposal put forward by my colleague Deputy Ó Ríordáin to amend the Order of Business to have the debate this week. We are glad it is being scheduled for two weeks' time but the reality is that every week counts for children with autism and their parents. We are very deeply concerned that the right to an education is not being vindicated for many children, including the almost 270 with autism who are without an appropriate school place for this coming September. We are concerned that the Government is simply not according this the urgent priority it requires. The Government is not a bystander in this, yet we heard a proposal to introduce so-called special educational needs centres, which apparently has now been jettisoned. We are hearing about delays in assessments for children and in allocation of special needs assistants, so we believe the Government priorities are not sufficiently urgently targeted.

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-06-02	dail	33	Urban Regeneration Report: Motion	dbsect_42	I welcome the opportunity to respond to the report of the joint committee on urban regeneration. I commend Deputy Matthews and his colleagues on the really important work the committee has done. I offer the Labour Party's support for its recommendations, which chime very much with calls made by our spokesperson on housing, Senator Moynihan. They are sensible recommendations. Everyone across the country acknowledges the need to regenerate urban centres by bringing derelict or vacant properties back into use including, and especially, for social and affordable housing. It is such a crucial point. The stark and dramatic figures on homelessness, with more than 10,000 people in emergency accommodation last week, nearly 3,000 of whom are children, illustrate the extent to which we need to ensure effective measures are put in place to bring vacant properties back into use. That is not the only way to tackle the homelessness and housing crises but it is a big part of it.That is acknowledged in this important report. Indeed, it was acknowledged earlier this week by the Raise the Roof campaign relaunch. I was glad to attend that along with many other colleagues and to hear Peter McVerry say that supply is a considerable issue. It is the big issue to address the housing crisis but it is also about affordable supply. Looking at how we can bring vacant and derelict properties back into use is one way to tackle the supply issue. The recommendations on the vacant homes tax and on changing the derelict sites levy to a derelict sites tax are sensible and effective. Alongside that, there are crucial recommendations on improving our data. As others have said, a considerable issue and obstacle to bringing derelict properties back into usage is the fact that we lack an online, publicly accessible and up-to-date register of properties at which we can look. In my own area of Dublin Bay South, a very high proportion of our households, 44%, are private rental accommodation. There is considerable housing need and significant issues about affordability of rents in this constituency and yet, I see vacant and derelict properties on every street down which I walk or cycle. They could be brought back into use through a combination of the carrot and big stick. We have all been talking about that and it is acknowledged in this report. I will also refer to the role of local authorities. The report acknowledges that it is not just about bringing measures into place. It is also about ensuring effective enforcement. My Labour Party colleagues who work as city and county councillors regularly convey to me their frustration at the way at which they are stymied by bureaucratic obstacles that prevent quick conversion of vacant and derelict sites. Senator Moynihan made this point in committee. While local authorities are often scapegoated, we need to ensure there is adequate resourcing in place. We have called for the establishment of dedicated teams in local authorities, tasked with identifying vacant and derelict sites and bringing them back to active use. We have submitted a number of questions to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and to local authorities, which tell us that many local authorities employ, at most, one full-time vacant sites officer. I know the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, has just referred to funding being made available to ensure there is better staffing in local authorities. However, current staffing levels are clearly not adequate even to ensure enforcement of existing measures on vacant and derelict sites. In response to a freedom of information request submitted by Senator Moynihan, it was revealed that even where local authorities have, through their existing staffing resources, identified vacant or derelict sites, they are facing enormous challenges in enforcing taxes and fines against owners and do not have enough guidance in respect of how to approach this problem. The co-ordinated approach advocated by this report is very much welcome. We have also proposed that the Government would provide local authorities with emergency compulsory purchase order powers. That would be the ultimate big-stick approach. Again, however, local authorities would have to be sufficiently resourced to be able to exercise those powers effectively. Those are the stick side of the measures. However, there is also the carrot side, which is the encouragement and support of property owners who have allowed sites to fall into dereliction, to bring them back into use. In Amsterdam, there is an interesting example of a policy whereby landowners are required to register property and, if the property has fallen into vacancy, they are encouraged to bring it back into use. Authorities work with users to help them make use of spaces and ensure there is sufficient support to do so. The owners go to the local authorities to look for meanwhile use of their site and there is incentive for landowners to reduce costs. It is seen as a cost to leave a site vacant. That is where we need to get to. Through a combination of incentives and taxes, we need to get to a point where it is too costly for an owner to leave a site, home, house or apartment empty or derelict and where local authorities and the Government are incentivising bringing sites back into use. Urban regeneration is not just about social and affordable housing, although that has to be a key focus. That is acknowledged in the report. Urban regeneration policies are also about ensuring vibrant, active and positive communities for us all. This goes beyond simply bringing vacant properties back into usage. It means ensuring maintenance of face-to-face services and community centres. I will host a public meeting in Rathmines next week because we have seen the closure of the citizens information centre there. Even in busy urban centres, we are seeing a closure of face-to-face settings and community amenities such as post offices. It is even more the case in rural areas. I was in County Westmeath on Monday, in a wonderful community hall in Rochfortbridge. I heard about real concerns about rural degeneration there with the closure of post offices, banks, Garda stations and many of the other settings and community facilities where people would have had the face-to-face contact that is essential for a vibrant public realm and space. The report acknowledges that this goes beyond housing. This is about creating better and more sustainable public spaces. Very welcome is the acknowledgement of the need to combine planning and urban regeneration policies with active transport and travel policies to plan for public transport, cycling and walking infrastructure to facilitate the development of meaningful and sustainable communities. I commend Deputy Matthews and those involved in this report. I hope the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is listening to this and that we will see these important recommendations swiftly brought into effect.	spk_328

Even in the unlikely event that we meet all of our goals in the climate action plan and see those policies fully implemented on time, we know our greenhouse gas emissions would only fall by 28% by 2030, just half of what is legally required in accordance with the Government's own laws. Labour has offered constructive engagement with the Government, we support the ambitious climate targets and along with most of our colleagues in the Opposition we have worked with the Government to ensure we will meet the targets. This report is alarming and I want to hear from the Taoiseach what the Government proposes to do about it in the short term. In particular we want to see that those sectoral emissions ceilings will be brought before us in the lifetime of this term of the Oireachtas. The Taoiseach said earlier that the sectoral emissions ceilings would be brought to Cabinet and the Dáil in the short term but we only have five sitting weeks left before the summer recess. We do not want to see this done at the eleventh hour; we want to have time as an Opposition to debate these issues.	spk_130

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-05-31	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I also raise the outrageous delays in Dublin Airport over the weekend. Clearly, these have had a devastating effect for so many people. We know 1,000 people have missed their flights and that people missed out on job opportunities, work-related travel, funerals, weddings, holidays and so much more. Clearly, this is a huge issue of consumer rights and a huge issue for those passengers who were so seriously inconvenienced over the weekend. However, it is not just a matter of poor planning by the DAA, although that is clearly a serious issue in itself, but also points to two broader issues for which the Government must take responsibility. The first is a failure of our national aviation policy, specifically, a failure to ensure effective distribution of flights among our airports, because it is not just about Dublin Airport and we are conscious many people are now looking to other airports like those in Cork or Farranfore. They are looking at airports where there is capacity and seeing the contrast between them and the chaos we saw at the weekend at Dublin Airport. It is, therefore, about a national aviation policy that must take into account distribution of workload among our regional airports. It is also, at a broader level, about workers' rights. That is something our transport spokesperson, Deputy Duncan Smith, has been raising consistently for some time now. We saw the DAA lay off staff during Covid in significant numbers and we saw the Government failing to put in a no-redundancy clause as a condition of the State supports that were being granted. We know the DAA took advantage of those supports, such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, that comes to an end today, yet there was no conditionality around workers' rights in that. We heard this morning from an anonymous worker at Dublin Airport about the serious issues around workplace conditions and pay that pertain for the many staff at Dublin Airport. Many of them took the brunt of understandable passenger frustration at the weekend and so many of them are in such a low-paid sector. The real concern we have is we have seen Dublin Airport become a low-cost airport, as the preponderance of low-cost airlines has dominated and we have seen a race to the bottom as a result. I am asking the Minister first to reassure passengers that we will not see the same chaotic scenes at the airport this weekend. Will he also assure the House there will be a proper and effective national aviation strategy put in place to ensure this imbalance between one airport and our other airports does not occur again? Will the Government also take steps to ensure the serious staffing issues and the low-pay conditions for so many staff at Dublin Airport are addressed and that we see better conditions for staff and a genuine commitment to move to a living wage, as we saw in our Labour Party Bill on a living wage?Last week, we welcomed the Tánaiste's announcement that the Government will introduce legislation on a living wage. We are conscious that Ireland has a serious problem with low pay, with one in five of the workforce low paid. It is not just about Dublin Airport, but clearly that was a major factor in the staffing shortfall that led to such chaotic scenes for so many at the weekend.	spk_5
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-05-31	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I thank the Minister for his response on the aviation strategy as it relates to airports such as Shannon, Cork and Farranfore. I also heard what he said about the recovery of aviation. However, this was not unpredictable. Airlines sold flights, so the number of people who would be flying out of Dublin Airport last weekend was utterly predictable. Clearly, there was a serious problem, a serious failure of workforce planning. In terms of the issue of staff conditions and pay, the trade unions at Dublin Airport have been raising this for some time. There is a serious issue again with retention of staff and that is related to the pay levels and the conditions that apply to staff at the airport. That has to be addressed to ensure we do not see these shortfalls on an ongoing basis. I repeat our concern about Dublin Airport effectively becoming a low-cost airport at a time when inflation is rising above 8% today and there is a cost-of-living crisis that is really biting into so many people's pockets and incomes. That is why the Labour Party has been saying that Ireland needs a pay rise and why we have been pushing for enactment of a Bill that would transform the minimum wage into a living wage. We call on the Government to adopt the principle in our Bill. That would bring about a much quicker transformation, a much speedier increase in the incomes people earn and would address some of the issues with low pay that are affecting staff numbers in Dublin Airport and in so many other places around the country.	spk_7

I was glad to join members of the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association in hospitals in my constituency. We are all conscious that there are long-running issues that had driven the medical laboratory scientists to take this action. In some cases, these issues have been ongoing for 20 years or more. I refer, for example, to long-standing pay and career development issues. There is massive frustration and burnout among medical scientists over the problems with recruitment, retention and pay and conditions. I appeal to the Tánaiste to ensure that there is serious engagement by Government with the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association in order to ensure that this matter is resolved, that the issues which gave rise to the industrial action are addressed and that we do not see any escalation.

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-05-18	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	"It has become clear, in particular in recent days, that the optimal solution to the issue of the national maternity hospital for both the Opposition and the Government is that of full public ownership - freehold ownership, not the conditional ownership represented by leasehold, however long it may be. I ask the Taoiseach again to take into account the clear and overwhelming majority of those of us in the Opposition who wish to see the hospital built on publicly owned land, who are concerned to see €1 billion of State money going into the building of a hospital on what will not ultimately be State-owned land, on land that is going to be held on a conditional ownership basis for the duration of that leasehold. That is the issue on which we have been focusing in the Labour Party, but also all of us across so many Opposition parties. I again ask that that might be taken into account, in particular if the Government is not proposing to contest the motion tonight. I refer again to the context for the maternity hospital, and to the point so many of us have made in the debates in recent days and weeks, that for far too long the State has invested so much public money into the building of schools and hospitals on land and sites not owned by the State, but rather that are owned in many cases by religious orders or by their proxies or successor companies. That lack of State investment over many years has failed so many people, in particular women and children. I wish to raise in particular an issue that was brought to light last night on RTÉ's ""Prime Time"" about the failure of the State to provide adequate services and supports for children with autism. We heard last night about the challenges facing Gillian and Darren Milne, who have fought year after year for their twin sons, Ryan and Kyle, to get access to appropriate places in a special school. Last night was the second time in a number of years that their battle has been covered on ""Prime Time"". The Taoiseach raised the case on Leaders' Questions nearly three years ago, in September 2019 and the then Taoiseach said the case of the Milne children was under consideration by the Minister for Education. The boys were then eight and now they are 11 and still awaiting an appropriate place. The parents are really struggling, as so many parents are. This is a huge issue across my constituency in Dublin Bay South. Miriam Kenny from Involve Autism was on ""Morning Ireland"" this morning speaking about the struggles so many parents in Dublin face. This is a countrywide issue and everywhere we go, we hear about the difficulties with accessing places for children with autism. I am conscious that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, did speak on the radio this morning about her new forecasting model, which will enable better long-term planning to ensure there will be adequate places available for children with autism. However, we have not seen any real indication of movement on that, nor did we hear any indication of the extent of the need, the number of children waiting on places. It is very welcome that the Minister of State has said she has had no option but to issue section 37A notices to schools and that she intends to follow up on that, but there is no indication as to when that will be done or how many places it will generate. I ask the Taoiseach for more clarity on what will be done for children in this position."	spk_117

I am sure the apology will be very much welcomed by those who have been so badly failed. The Taoiseach speaks of an absence of proactivity and the need for stronger legislation. Yet clearly, there is a responsibility on the Government to take those proactive steps and to deliver the amendments to legislation that are needed. This is not just about the provision of special schools. It is also about providing adequate supports for children in mainstream schools. The issue of SNA allocation in particular has been difficult and problematic for many schools. My colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, raised this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, last Thursday. He was seeking clarity on when the allocation of special needs assistants will be made. Just as with the section 37A notices, it is simply not good enough for schools, and especially for parents and children, to have to wait until the eleventh hour to hear whether an SNA allocation has been made or if a section 37A notice has been issued. There is a lack of forward planning and a lack of availability, particularly for secondary school places. We are seeing a pinch there for so many parents and children.  The absence of proactivity is the responsibility of the Government. I agree with the Taoiseach that there has been an absence of proactivity, but we need to see proactivity from the Government on this, in the interests of children. 	spk_119

Its cynical attempt to describe it as a measure to protect the Good Friday Agreement will, in our view, damage the institutions.We are very concerned, as I know all Deputies are, that if the British Foreign Secretary moves ahead with this naked political posturing, then it would be a breach of international law and has the potential to seriously undermine efforts to normalise the post-Brexit trade landscape on our islands. A unilateral action will not help resolve this. I should say that I spoke with the British ambassador this morning and put that view to him. I am glad to hear that formally, the British Government is saying it wants and would prefer a negotiated solution. It wants to see the Executive up and running again. Has the Taoiseach had direct engagement to ensure we reach that negotiation point and condemn utterly the unilateral action?	spk_227

Ireland has some of the most expensive childcare costs in Europe and we need clarity on how it is proposed to reduce fees for parents, to improve pay and conditions for staff and to improve the availability of places for children. In Limerick on Monday, I visited two brilliant childcare and early years education services, namely, Northside Family Resource Centre and Our Lady of Lourdes Childworld in Rosbrien. I was asked whether the Government's new funding model will build in recognition of places offering early childhood care and education in disadvantaged settings and whether there will be a delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, style mechanism for childcare settings where there are added needs and where additional resources may be required. In principle, we need to see rapid action on this from the Government because there is so little availability of childcare places and so many parents are struggling with the fees.	spk_245

We have engaged with the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly. I, along with many of my party colleagues, attended the rally on Saturday and saw the immense concern, distress and worry that many people feel about the fact the hospital is to be built on land that is not ultimately going to be in public ownership. We in the Labour Party first raised the question of compulsory purchase five years ago, in 2017. Just today, I received clear figures from An Bord Pleanála as to the period for determining compulsory purchase orders, CPOs. In 2021, the average number of weeks to dispose all CPO cases was 24.72. From the beginning of January to the end of April this year, the average time to dispose all CPO cases was 20 weeks, which is just under five months.	spk_135

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-05-17	dail	33	National Maternity Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_14	"Earlier today, on behalf of the Labour Party, I expressed our strong disappointment to the Taoiseach at the decision that has been taken by Cabinet. As I have said and as my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, has said, in Labour we continue to stand firm in expressing our strong concerns about ongoing issues with the control, ownership and governance of the new national maternity hospital. We thank the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, for the engagement we have had in the last two weeks and we acknowledge the need for a new national maternity hospital to be built to provide women with the healthcare we so badly need. We are disappointed that the engagement and two-week delay did not lead to any change or substantive improvement in the deal that was on offer and we should have learned by now that there is a need to get this right because we have such a long legacy in Ireland of church and State interference in the exercise of women's right to reproductive healthcare. Many of us fought for decades to see the eighth amendment repealed and when we finally achieved that in 2018, only four years ago, we were able to introduce legal abortion in Ireland.We know from experience, our own bitter experience and experience elsewhere, that these hard-won gains for women's rights and women's reproductive rights can be reversed or undermined all too easily. Indeed, we have seen that clearly in recent weeks with the awful prospect that the pro-choice landmark Roe  Apart from that real and valid fear that we have about the reversal of rights won, we also have the principle of putting €1 billion of State money into a facility that will not be constructed on State-owned land. Ireland has a long legacy of investing public money into building up the infrastructure of voluntary hospitals and schools on sites that are owned by religious orders or their proxies or successor companies. I have spoken before in this House about the well-established practice where religious orders divest their assets from their own ownership and into the ownership of lay-run trusts, which can often have a more hard-line approach to negotiation with the State than the religious orders which preceded them. That is the context in which we distrust this deal. That is the context for ongoing concerns. That is the context for our real and pressing need to see this national maternity hospital built on publicly owned land. The two-week delay has not resolved our concerns. Indeed, our engagement has strengthened our resolve that the Government should have retained the leverage power of the compulsory purchase order, CPO. I spoke today with the Taoiseach about figures I just got from An Bord Pleanála about the length of time it takes to resolve a CPO. The average number of weeks this year to dispose CPO cases is 20.4 weeks, less than five months. In a context where we have now waited nine years and we have undoubtedly seen incremental improvements in the deal on offer, the State has removed from itself the option of a CPO and therefore has removed that bargaining power. The Government has now taken this less-than-optimal deal, the imperfect deal, as Deputy Duncan Smith said. We know it is less than optimal and less than perfect because we know from what the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and others have said that the Government wanted the site to be in public ownership. At least one Minister for Health sought the Attorney General's advice on the merits of a CPO. However, that was not pursued and instead the Government settled for this less-than-optimal deal. As a result, we are letting down women in Ireland and we are letting down the principle of church-State separation. We have got conditional ownership. It is ownership of a sort but it is not outright ownership, not freehold ownership. It is leasehold interest and however long a leasehold is, it remains conditional ownership. The conditions are clearly set out in the legal documents: the conditionality of appointment of three directors; the right to appoint three directors from St. Vincent's Healthcare Group; the right to have a rotating chair every three years; the right to have a penalty rent; and the phrase that so many of us have picked up on and are concerned about of ""clinically appropriate"" which clearly qualifies the availability of all legally permissible services. These are the conditions consequent on the leasehold arrangement and these are the reasons why we continue to have such valid, solid and substantial concerns about the deal that has been done. That is why at this very late stage we are still calling on the Government to go back and seek a better deal, as has been done before. This is a better deal than was previously on the table from St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, so it can be improved upon. If the Government were to go back to the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group there would be a united Opposition who all want to see this hospital built on publicly owned land in the interests of women's reproductive healthcare."	spk_324
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-05-12	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_27	I return to the question of the national maternity hospital. First, I thank the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, for his engagement with the Labour Party Parliamentary Party yesterday evening. We were very appreciative of the opportunity to engage with the Minister, clinicians and legal advisers to hear more about the Government's proposals, to dig into the legal documents somewhat and to hear more about the choice of the St. Vincent's site. While we did receive clarity, our concerns remain. We received much greater clarity as to why the St. Vincent's site is optimal in the view of clinicians. It is clear from the view of senior clinicians that this is almost the only site on which they might envisage that the new maternity hospital would be built. However, this clarity just crystallised the position for us which is that if that is indeed the optimal site, the optimal approach to acquiring that site for the building of the hospital is to acquire it freehold, to ensure it is either gifted or sold at a nominal fee to the State. That is why we renew our calls today, as we renewed them last night with the Minister, for the State to consider the compulsory purchase order, CPO, option. If this is the optimal site, we need to look at the best approach on which the site is to be held. That is clearly a freehold ownership by the State. That is clear from the evidence given by the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to the health committee yesterday where he stressed that successive Ministers for Health including the Minister, Deputy Harris, repeatedly asked the Religious Sisters of Charity and the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group to gift the land to the State but that this had been refused. We say that the Minister should now have the courage to take on the successor company that holds the land and to seek that the land be gifted, to renew calls that the land be gifted or sold at a nominal fee to the State or indeed to take up the CPO option. The State has real history of taking up the CPO option. It is not some kind of far-fetched notion. Our colleague Deputy Howlin, who has extensive experience, has advised that this is a realistic option. It is time that we stood up to the religious orders and their successor companies. For far too long, the State has been submissive in enabling ownership of land to continue in the hands of religious organisations, and the lay-run trusts that have succeeded them in property ownership, in our school system and in our hospital system. If we know that the optimal way to have this hospital built is on land that is owned freehold, then let us go back and ensure that that is done, that the land is gifted or sold to the State for a nominal fee. I know the health committee has sought a further short delay on the making of the Cabinet decision in the interests of further engagement to allow us to hear from further stakeholders. I ask the Tánaiste to consider that request and to consider the Government's policy by looking now at taking on the power of the religious orders and successor entities.	spk_218

All of us want the same outcome, which is a state-of-the-art, fit-for-purpose new national maternity hospital for women's healthcare in Ireland. We have heard why that should be at the St. Vincent's site. However, it is time to call the bluff of the owners of that site. It is time to call them out. While a 299-year lease is certainly better than the previous alternative that was offered of a 99-year lease, it still remains different from freehold. It still remains conditional ownership and not outright ownership in perpetuity. That is the difficulty we have. We believe it is time to call the bluff of the owners of the site and to say that we, as a State, wish to take ownership in perpetuity of the land on which the new national maternity hospital is to be built, to put beyond doubt the future ownership and future availability right into the next century of all necessary maternity and reproductive healthcare services for women. For too long women in this country have been failed by the State and by the church authorities, often working in tandem. We need to call them out on it now.	spk_220
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-05-11	dail	33	Living Wage Bill 2022: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_8	"I move: ""That the Bill be now read a Second Time."" I am delighted to introduce the Labour Party Living Wage Bill 2022. I propose to share time with my colleague, Deputy Nash. For many years, the Labour Party has campaigned for the introduction of a living wage in Ireland. To do so effectively requires a legislative framework and for that reason we have introduced this Bill. It could not be more timely as the cost-of-living crisis squeezes every household, individual and family throughout the country. We are conscious that inflation is at a 22 year high. We know that a radical package of measures is needed now to tackle that cost-of-living crisis and to ensure that households will be supported in attempting to meet rising costs. We in the Labour Party believe that Ireland needs a pay rise. It is as part of that campaign we are introducing this Bill. We know that later this week the consumer price index rate will be published by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, but it will not tell us anything we do not already know. We are hearing it daily from our constituents. I am hearing it from my constituents in Dublin Bay South. We know that inflation is at a record 22 year high and that the essentials on which every household relies are rising in price. We have seen basic groceries like milk, bread and pasta, heating and energy costs and fuel and gas prices increase in recent weeks and months. Rents in our capital city and across Ireland are at historic highs, with a real shortage of rental accommodation, as we all know. That is putting the cost of a secure home outside the reach of many individuals and couples. Expensive childcare and medical bills, along with education and transport costs, are also squeezing everyone. Everyone is feeling the pinch. We have to see what can be done to address this. The Government has implemented some welcome measures. We welcomed the measures on public transport which took effect earlier this week but we in the Labour Party believe they do not go far enough. While there are welcome initiatives that can and should be taken to address the cost of services such as transport and childcare, on which we have put forward some radical proposals, we also need to see support measures in place to ensure people's incomes are increased. Every day, we are hearing from those whose incomes are no longer enough to meet the rising costs they face. They may be decent pay by relative standards, but that pay is no longer enough to meet the cost of living. We are also hearing from those who are low paid in Ireland. One in five of the Irish workforce is on low pay. We have a low-pay economy. That has always been an issue, but all the more so with the rising cost of living and with rising inflation. The most effective way to address falling incomes is to ensure that Ireland gets a pay rise. We need to see an increase in real terms in the take-home pay that people are left with at the end of the week or the month. That is why we are introducing this Bill. This Bill would go some way to addressing the issue of low pay. In particular, it would transform the minimum structure into a living wage structure. That would have a significant effect, in the first instance on those 130,000 workers who are currently on the minimum wage. The key difference between the current minimum wage of €10.50 per hour and what we are proposing is that a living wage is a mechanism to take into account the cost of living. It is a better way to ensure that people's incomes are sustained and supported through periods of rising inflation and rising prices. This is acknowledged by the Government in that the programme for Government includes a commitment to progress the national minimum wage into a living wage over the lifetime of the Government. Our concern is that we have not seen action in that regard to date. Almost two years into this Government's term, the lack of progress is costing those who need that pay rise now. I am aware that the Tánaiste has said that he intends to bring proposals to Government by the summer. I am conscious that as recently as January of this year the Tánaiste received a report from the Low Pay Commission, based on academic research, into the introduction of a living wage and that that report has made recommendations, but we have not seen that report. It has not yet been published and so we are not clear as to how Government intends to make any progress on the transformative strategy that is needed to change the minimum wage into a living wage. I would welcome a response from the Minister of State on that issue. In addition, we hope that the Government will see fit to support this Bill. With this Bill, we are seeking to ensure that the pressure is kept on and that the issue of a living wage is highlighted so that those on low pay are not left behind. Let us see what would be done if this Bill were to be introduced. When the minimum wage was first introduced over 20 years ago it was set at two thirds of median average income. Had it been maintained at that rate, it would now be approximately €12.90 per hour or equivalent to the 2021 living wage rate. That is significantly above the current rate of the minimum wage which, as we know, is set at €10.50 per hour. We are conscious that with inflation the living wage will need to increase by somewhere in the region of 7% this year, which would take it to €13.80 per hour by the end of the year. Instead, as I said, this year 130,000 workers are left with the current minimum wage of €10.50 per hour, leaving an hourly wage gap of over €2 between the legal minimum and what is estimated as necessary to sustain a decent standard of living. The most recent increase of 30 cent to the minimum wage in January was inadequate. It has been already swallowed up by rising inflation. As an interim measure, we have called for the minimum wage to be increased immediately by €1 per hour and for a mechanism or pathway to be put in place to increase that over time to a living wage. That is exactly what this Bill seeks to do. It would increase the minimum wage to a living wage and transform the system around the criteria and determination of pay rates and in doing so it would also have a transformative effect on the lives and incomes of those currently on the lowest of pay. Clearly, we cannot just stop there. We need to see stronger rights for collective bargaining. Again, we in the Labour Party have consistently called for this. We know that in those countries where there are higher rates of unionisation and higher rates of collective pay bargaining, there are better mechanisms to achieve decent and sustainable pay rates.We believe the State must use its purchasing power more effectively by rewarding and recognising those companies and employers that engage in collective bargaining and pay fair rates, and we are all aware of those employers. There are very decent employers that are doing so. Indeed, many employers currently have to pay increased wages to recruit where there are skills shortages and recruitment crises in sectors such as hospitality, home care and childcare. I thank the living wage technical group for its work and research over many years, which has contributed to building the case for a living wage. I thank those campaigners and trade union members and activists who joined me and my Labour Party colleagues yesterday at the launch of the Bill. The technical group has given us a definition of the living wage and we are building on that in the Bill. Turning to the detail of the Bill, to which my party colleagues will speak further, its purpose is to amend the National Minimum Wage Act so as to transform the minimum wage into this living wage mechanism. Section 2 will transform the Low Pay Commission, established by my party colleague Deputy Nash when in government, into a living wage commission. While we recognise the Low Pay Commission has done excellent work and carried out important research, it is constrained through legislation from acting further on a living wage framework without direction from the Oireachtas. This is the enabling legislation, therefore, to transform the Low Pay Commission into a living wage commission. Section 3 will assign new duties to the commission to allow it to make recommendations to transform that minimum hourly rate concept into one of a living wage, while section 4 sets out the new functions of the commission and, crucially, how the living wage will be determined. We are calling in this Bill for the minimum wage to be transformed into a living wage over a period of three years and, once that has been achieved, to enable an annual calculation to be carried out to maintain the appropriate rate of a living income. Critically, the living wage must not be less than two thirds of the median level of earnings of employees in the State, according to the figures most recently published by the CSO. The commission will have a set of criteria available to it, as set out in the Bill, as to how the living wage will be determined. Before I conclude, I pay tribute to the work of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and, in particular, its recent report published for May Day, which emphasised the need both for a decent social wage in Ireland and for the Government to bring forward a package of measures to ensure employees' take-home pay will be effectively increased, through both tackling the cost of basic public services such as healthcare, which are free in many other European countries, and ensuring incomes will be increased through both a system of collective bargaining and increases to the minimum wage. This combination of measures will give Ireland an effective pay rise and households and individuals throughout the country a much-needed break. As I said when I launched the Labour Party’s Ireland Needs a Pay Rise campaign, a package of measures is needed. The Bill is one important part of that package, but we have also called on the Government to reduce the cost of childcare radically, extend free GP care to all children under 18, introduce free public transport and freeze rents for three years. Again, this package of measures, taken together, will ensure individuals, households and families throughout Ireland will get the pay rise that is so badly needed to address this crisis in the cost of living."	spk_19

Since then, I know the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, has been engaging with the Joint Committee on Health. Indeed, the parliamentary Labour Party looks forward to engaging with him. However, we have also seen the publication last night of a statement from Professor Deirdre Madden and Dr. Sarah McLoughlin in which they set out their concerns in respect of ownership, control and governance in more detail and point out the difference between freehold and leasehold ownership. The concerns they have set out exactly reflect the concerns the Labour Party has been expressing. They reminded us that in 2018 the Day report, produced by the independent review group commissioned by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, recommended that the State should own the land on which hospitals and schools are built. The question remains as to why this recommendation was not followed then. Why are these Byzantine legal arrangements being favoured over the straightforward and clear-cut arrangement whereby the land would be gifted to the State? Why can it not be in public ownership and freehold?	spk_93

This has a knock-on effect because many people are unable to afford basic costs such as basic housing costs and are unable to contemplate having a secure home. They are simply on too low a rate of pay to be able to meet rising housing prices and rising prices for childcare, transport, food and fuel. This morning the Labour Party's Living Wage Bill 2022 was debated and we welcome the fact that the Government did not oppose the Bill. However, when will the Government move on the Bill? When will it move to ensure there is a clear pathway to transform the minimum wage into a living wage, as promised in the programme for Government? A report from the Low Pay Commission has been with the Tánaiste since March. Can the Taoiseach confirm when that will go before the Cabinet, when it will be published and when we will see the transformative measures to transform the hourly rate of those on the lowest pay into a living wage? When will such measures come into effect to transform the lives of those who are so desperately affected by the cost-of-living crisis?	spk_152

This is yet another wake-up call on climate, as if we needed one. The brutal war on Ukraine reminds us on a daily basis of our continued overreliance on fossil fuels. On a more optimistic note, as we saw in the pandemic, we can see the State, and other states, pivoting quickly to address urgent challenges. We need to see this sense of urgency brought to bear on the climate crisis. We have called for urgent action on fast-tracking retrofitting and energy efficiency measures for homes and households. In recent times we have called for those homes that rely on turf for heating to be first in line for energy upgrades and greater subsidies. Has the Cabinet committee considered this? I thank the Taoiseach for his clarification on the membership and terms of reference of the climate action delivery board.

We are making progress on reviewing the recommendations of the citizens' assembly. Its 45 important recommendations are effectively a blueprint for achieving gender equality. We want to produce an action plan by the end of this year to ensure those recommendations will be implemented. We have sought assurances from the Taoiseach and the Government that a referendum will be held next year to put into effect recommendations Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, of the citizens’ assembly. In other words, we are seeking constitutional change to delete the sexist language about women and mothers from the Constitution and to strengthen our equality guarantee. Can the Taoiseach give some indication that the Government will commit to holding that referendum, building on the work the joint committee is doing and the citizens’ assembly has done? My colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, and others have repeatedly sought a date for the proposed citizens’ assembly on drug use. Can that be brought forward to commence early next year, as I believe the Taoiseach indicated previously? Can that be confirmed? We welcomed the citizens’ assembly on a directly-elected mayor for Dublin. Is it the intention to have an election for that office in May 2024? What is holding up plans for a directly-elected mayor of Limerick? We do not see any sign of plans to ensure the election for that office will take place either this year or next year. Since it has been three years since a plebiscite was held to introduce the office of a directly-elected mayor of Limerick and more than a year since the general scheme of the relevant Bill was published, we ask for a timeline for having a directly-elected mayor of Limerick.	spk_180

This has a knock-on effect because many people are unable to afford basic costs such as basic housing costs and are unable to contemplate having a secure home. They are simply on too low a rate of pay to be able to meet rising housing prices and rising prices for childcare, transport, food and fuel. This morning the Labour Party's Living Wage Bill 2022 was debated and we welcome the fact that the Government did not oppose the Bill. However, when will the Government move on the Bill? When will it move to ensure there is a clear pathway to transform the minimum wage into a living wage, as promised in the programme for Government? A report from the Low Pay Commission has been with the Tánaiste since March. Can the Taoiseach confirm when that will go before the Cabinet, when it will be published and when we will see the transformative measures to transform the hourly rate of those on the lowest pay into a living wage? When will such measures come into effect to transform the lives of those who are so desperately affected by the cost-of-living crisis?	spk_152

This is yet another wake-up call on climate, as if we needed one. The brutal war on Ukraine reminds us on a daily basis of our continued overreliance on fossil fuels. On a more optimistic note, as we saw in the pandemic, we can see the State, and other states, pivoting quickly to address urgent challenges. We need to see this sense of urgency brought to bear on the climate crisis. We have called for urgent action on fast-tracking retrofitting and energy efficiency measures for homes and households. In recent times we have called for those homes that rely on turf for heating to be first in line for energy upgrades and greater subsidies. Has the Cabinet committee considered this?

Our concerns persist. They are valid and legitimate concerns that remain around the ownership, control and governance of the proposed hospital.

That is the difference between public ownership in perpetuity and the leasehold arrangement, a ""complicated"" arrangement, as Mr. Fergus Finlay describes it, that is currently on the table. The core point for us in the Labour Party is that we want to see a publicly-owned hospital built on publicly-owned land. That does not mean land that is held on a 300-, 200- or 100-year leasehold where St. Vincent's Healthcare Group is the landlord and the HSE the tenant.

These concerns have not been addressed in recent days and we were not reassured by the interview with the deputy chairperson of the current board of the National Maternity Hospital.

Why, in 2017, was a decision made to proceed with this convoluted Byzantine legal arrangement, which throws into doubt issues around a lingering ethos? Why was the decision made then to proceed, rather than simply insisting on the land being transferred into public ownership? Why did the State put aside the question of a compulsory purchase order mechanism? Why did the State lose that leverage by which it would have been possible to acquire the site in perpetuity in public ownership? These are the key, valid questions that we in the Labour Party have. For us, the site must be in public ownership. It is simply not good enough that we are contemplating, in 2022, building an €800 million or €1 billion public hospital on land that will remain in private ownership by a landlord and that will not be in the ownership of the State in perpetuity.	spk_43

We are glad that the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is engaging with us and indeed we will be meeting with him tomorrow for a briefing. We want to ensure that we get this right and that we move away from the mistakes of the past. There is clearly an agenda lying behind the decision not to gift the land to the State or sell it at a reduced rate. It is not an agenda of the Government or of the HSE, but there is an agenda and a rationale, presumably, behind the decision by the current owners of the land not to transfer it to the State for a nominal sum or indeed to gift it to the State. That is the question we are asking. I do not think any of us on the Opposition benches have got a satisfactory answer as to why the land could not simply be transferred in that way.

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-05-10	dail	33	Europe Day: Statements	dbsect_14	On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the opportunity to speak today to mark Europe Day. It is a particularly auspicious date as today we also mark 50 years since the referendum to join the then European Economic Community was held and passed in Ireland. Since then the EU has driven social and economic change across Ireland, for the most part for the better. In particular, the equal rights of women have been advanced through the passage of EU laws. There have also been difficulties, of course, and the Labour Party has been very critical in many instances of the European project over the years, including at the initial point of holding the referendum 50 years ago. All of us are cognisant of the rigid economic approach taken by the EU and the ECB to the economic crash in 2009 that led to us losing our sovereignty as a nation. However, with Brexit and most recently with the horrific and brutal war in Ukraine, we have seen how the EU has acted collectively and strongly in solidarity and how being an integral part of the EU has amplified and strengthened our voice as a nation within the EU. Learning from the Covid-19 pandemic, we have seen the potential for stronger integration across the EU in healthcare, most notably in collective purchases. After a slow and difficult start, with difficult issues around the purchasing of equipment, in particular, the EU worked together on vaccine purchase and we, as a small country, were able to access vaccines through an EU deal that a similar country might have struggled to secure without that collective strength. The war in Ukraine has shown the real potential for greater collective solidarity across EU nations through working to ensure security of supply and a refusal to deal with Russian oil and gas. This also has massive implications for our policies on climate. Indeed, one of the strongest and most positive aspects of EU policy in recent years is the European new green deal. It is important we see that collective solidarity come to the fore in working on tackling climate emissions and in meeting climate targets. Today, there was a stark and dire warning from the World Meteorological Organization regarding the path we are on currently, with a 50:50 chance that average global temperatures will exceed the Paris goal of 1.5°C over the next five years. That shows the vital importance of working collectively to ensure effective action on climate. The war in Ukraine has put in clear focus the initial project of the EU as a peace project in its institution shortly after the Second World War, and in the aftermath of that war and the devastation wreaked across the Continent. It was born out of a desire to deliver closer economic and political co-operation and to avoid the horrors of war being inflicted on the Continent again. That idea of Europe is once again a political goal that is at the fore of all our minds as we see war being fought on our Continent and the brutal invasion of Ukraine. Certainly, for people in Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and the countries of the Western Balkans, the peace and stability they have seen brought about by the EU are clearly an aspiration for many of them. We must support them and, in particular, the request by Ukraine that we support its rapid accession to the EU. The Taoiseach has spoken on that on a number of occasions. It is also important to note how generously the EU has responded by delivering aid and supplies and, critically, by providing refuge for so many millions of those fleeing their homeland because of the war. While Ireland is militarily neutral, we should not be politically neutral in the face of this brutal and illegal war. We have been clear in our role to support Ukrainians fleeing the devastation there and to support the non-military response to the war at European level. As regards the European response, I wish to speak briefly about collective economic approaches being adopted by the EU. In the mechanism of the post-Covid recovery fund, the EU introduced the concept of collective debt through the issuing of €800 billion worth of joint bonds to fund the recovery. That was a historical development that could have been learned from the previous response to the economic crash in the late 2000s. The same mechanism is now being proposed as a way of raising the billions of euro that will be needed to support and fund Ukraine and, when the war ends, to support the rebuilding of that country. The Labour Party would welcome that plan. We can see the clear need for collective effort and collective financing for Ukraine, as well as debt relief for Ukraine. As my colleague, Deputy Howlin, said in the past year, the European Union reflects the political opinions of member state governments and of directly elected MEPs. That is why we must campaign, and I am conscious it is a real challenge for our party, to elect left wing and centre left MEPs and progressive governments across the EU to deliver on our political objectives and to ensure that the EU acts with that sense of collective solidarity. There was great relief across Europe when Marine Le Pen was defeated in France. To have seen the election go a different way and to have seen a government that was staunchly against the EU and committed to undermining the EU would have been against all our interests. Social Europe, that collective goal to which the Labour Party and the Party of European Socialists aspire, has delivered rights for workers and women and for greater equality. It has also delivered on employment rights generally. The negotiation under way on an EU law for an adequate minimum wage will deliver on a key principle of the European Pillar of Social Rights. Tomorrow the Dáil will debate the Labour Party's Living Wage Bill 2022. I have circulated an email to all colleagues about that. It is one aspect of ensuring there is a rise in people's incomes to meet the terrible cost-of-living crisis that so many are experiencing across the country at present. We are seeking Government support for that Bill. It is in line with a commitment in the programme for Government to ensure that the minimum wage becomes a living wage and that there is a mechanism to ensure a pathway to a living wage over three years. That is the premise of our Bill and we hope to see it passed in the House tomorrow.	spk_215

We welcomed the publication of certain relevant documents on the HSE website and the Government delaying the decision in this regard. Having listened to the exchanges this morning, however, it seems the Government is not proposing to make any changes. Yet we are still lacking some crucial information. We have still not seen the details of any correspondence there may have been between the Vatican and the Religious Sisters of Charity concerning the transfer of ownership. We understand that permission from the Vatican was required to transfer ownership, but we do not know if the Minister has seen that correspondence or if the Government has sought it. The Government may say it is relevant, but it is deeply relevant because it may answer the question of why the hospital site cannot simply be gifted to the State. If this new hospital is to be public in all but name and if a 299-year lease amounts to a public site in all but name, then why not put this matter beyond doubt and make it public? Let us see why the Religious Sisters of Charity cannot simply gift this site to the State.	spk_253
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-05-05	dail	33	Living Wage Bill 2022: First Stage	dbsect_30	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the law relating to the determination, declaration and review of a national minimum hourly rate of pay for employees so as to arrive at and thereafter preserve an hourly rate that represents a living income; and to provide for related matters. It is timely that I seek to introduce this Bill today, because last weekend we marked May Day when across the world we celebrate workers and advances and progress on workers' rights, but also note what still has to be done. I was proud to march in Belfast and Dublin in both large marches on our island to celebrate May Day, which is of course an international celebration.  It is in the spirit of seeking to advance the cause of workers' rights and ensure that we are building on past progress that we are introducing this important Bill, which seeks to ensure that the hundreds of thousands of people who are on low pay in Ireland can get, in effect, the pay rise they so badly need. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the National Minimum Wage Acts so as to provide for a pathway to a living wage as the national minimum wage.  Our Bill would transform the low pay commission into a living wage commission and assign it new duties to enable it to make recommendations to ensure that the minimum wage is transformed into a living wage over a three-year period. We provide the definition of a living wage, meaning an annual wage that, in the opinion of the commission, if paid to a single adult person living alone and in full-time employment would afford that person a standard of living that meets the person's needs at a minimum but socially acceptable level.  I acknowledge that the programme for Government committed to progress from the current national minimum wage to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government, but we in the Labour Party are conscious that nothing has yet been done to make any progress or deliver on this commitment. We understand it would require legislation in order to change the remit of the low pay commission, and that is precisely what this Bill seeks to do. The Bill is also timely because we are seeing an unprecedented spike in the cost of living, a spike that is affecting every household, individual, family and community across Ireland. Inflation is surging to a 22-year high and the costs of fuel, rent, housing, food, childcare and basic services are rising. Even the price of basic items like bread and milk are rising. All of us are hearing daily from constituents who are feeling a real squeeze and whose incomes are no longer enough to meet the rising cost of living that they face.  The Government response to the cost of living crisis has simply not gone far enough. Ireland need a pay rise. In particular, for those on low pay we need a clear increase in the national minimum wage in order that it can rise to a genuinely living wage. A national pay rise means more than that. It means creating an effective pay rise by addressing the costs of basic services for which people are paying after-tax income, such as healthcare and childcare, services which in other countries are heavily subsidised or free. We are unapologetic about the need to ensure that the costs of those services are addressed and tackled in a serious and substantial way in order to give people what is effectively a pay rise.  I am conscious that at the weekend, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, produced a report on this very topic about the need to ensure that incomes are adequate to meet the cost of basic services, not only by increasing incomes but also by addressing the cost of those services. We in the Labour Party are also unapologetic about the need for negotiated pay rises for those who may not be on low pay but whose income is simply no longer enough to meet the rising costs they face in housing and feeding and accessing care for their children. For all of these reasons, we are conscious that this is an important time to seek a legislative intervention to increase the national minimum wage.  We will bring forward the Bill during our Private Members' time next Wednesday. I am delighted to introduce it today, in the week of May Day, and in light of our clear call on Government that Ireland now needs a pay rise.	spk_301

I thank the Ministers, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, Coveney and O'Gorman, for updating us on the Government's response to Russian war of brutal aggression on a peaceful democratic country. I will start by commending the Government on the generosity of spirit that it and the Irish people have shown in their approach in offering support and sanctuary to those fleeing the war in Ukraine. We in the Labour Party will stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and we will stand in support of all the Government efforts that have been taken to ensure that we are offering as much sanctuary and support as we can in this country, as the Minister, Deputy Coveney, said, without the imposition of quotas or visas.  This is a national effort. We are militarily, but not politically, neutral on this and that is clear. Certainly, in my previous capacity, on the then Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence, I spoke out consistently against Russia's aggression in waging a proxy war in Syria. It is the exact same tactics that we are seeing here with Russia waging this war, directly, in this case, on the people of Ukraine but also, as the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, said, weaponising human misery by seeking to undermine European solidarity and European democracies through creating and exacerbating a cost-of-living crisis and through causing so many thousands, indeed, millions, of Ukrainian people to have to flee their homeland in such appalling circumstances. We will continue, of course, to stand in solidarity with Irish Government efforts to ensure Russian accountability for complicity in the brutal war crimes that we have seen committed against the people of Ukraine. I appreciate the Minister, Deputy Coveney's update on that. Last week the Labour Parliamentary Party wrote to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to offer our constructive support in the national effort to ensure that we in Ireland can offer the strongest possible support to our Ukrainian friends who have come here seeking sanctuary. We are also responding separately - my colleague, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, our housing spokesperson, is collating a response to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien - with constructive suggestions on possible vacant housing options. We welcome the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien's call for buildings and his engagement with Opposition representatives on this. We recognise the immense challenges involved and we appreciate and acknowledge the substantial effort of so many public servants, civil servants, NGOs and local authorities that have really stepped up. Fifty staff, in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth alone, form the Ukraine unit. I have met with so many public and civil servants who have done so much already to support Ukrainian visitors. In my constituency, in Dublin Bay South, we have seen a huge community effort. We have seen the great Evergreen centre in Terenure set up a weekly event for those hosting Ukrainian families and for their Ukrainian visitors, Swan Leisure in Rathmines holding community events, and many church groups across the constituency and other community groups organising events, and we are seeing similar across the country. We are also looking at accommodation needs. I, along with my colleague, Councillor Dermot Lacey, have identified the long vacant Baggot Street hospital as a State-owned building. I think it is on the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien's radar that it may well be available to offer emergency accommodation. I am also aware of Avalon House, for example, an empty hostel on Aungier Street in Dublin city centre, that also has space and has quite a considerable number of empty bedrooms. We are aware that the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman's Department is co-ordinating the State response but clearly there is substantial feed-in and co-ordination with other Departments. In our letter to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, we sought to offer our support in a range of different areas. On the accommodation point, we asked for clarity on the role of international protection accommodation service, IPAS, as compared with the role of local authorities. We have received a little more clarity on that today but we want to ensure that there is clear co-ordinating of the accommodation needs of Ukrainian guests. Certainly, I have been contacted by constituents telling me there is a lack of information available. The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, said we all need to be patient. Clearly, this is a massive effort and the Irish Red Cross has had to have significant additional capacity provided to enable it to co-ordinate responses to those pledges of accommodations alone. Certainly, there should be clearer information and co-ordination in terms of the offer of accommodation and I absolutely agree with the need to ensure that there is no divisive rhetoric used in the co-ordinated response on accommodation. This can be a win-win in terms of offering constructive solutions to address our own pre-existing homelessness crisis along with providing more emergency and shorter-term accommodation for our Ukrainian guests. Student accommodation clearly will be coming into the picture as well in the summer and that will be welcome. In my constituency, there is quite a significant body of availability there. We are also asking for a timeline for the establishment of community hubs across the country. We understand Tusla is the designated agency and we have suggested that it might be preferable to establish such hubs uniformly across the country. We have asked how the views and experiences of those affected who have fled Ukraine can be inputted into developing our national response. In my engagement with my local officials in Dublin City Council, I am aware there is a concern about having a clear funding stream available to local authorities to enable them to offer support. In many cases, this involves small amounts of money. These are essential supports to fund community and voluntary organisations working on a local basis with Ukrainian families and individuals here and we seek to have that clear funding stream available. On the issue of employment, any Ukrainian visitors I have met are so keen to engage in work and many are so highly skilled. I met some, particularly women, with wonderful qualifications. I have also met with local employers who are keen to recruit and to ensure that they can match their skill shortages in sectors, for example, pharmacy, retail, hospitality and care work, with the skills of Ukrainians coming here. I have already put down questions on this. What co-ordinated response can we offer to those who wish to offer their services and to those who are looking to employ Ukrainian visitors here given the skill shortage and the recruitment difficulties in many sectors? We have also raised questions with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, around educational needs of children to ensure minimal disruption of children. There are some reports of children being moved from school to school since arrival in Ireland. That is clearly regrettable. Indeed, there is a need for supports for those with mental health issues and with physical health issues to ensure that there is consistency of care from GPs across the country. We have offered many different constructive solutions and we look forward to engaging further with the Government. I will hand over to my colleague.	spk_316

I welcome the decision by Cabinet last night to delay, as I understand it, by at least two weeks, the making of any final decision. I welcome the Minister's commitment to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, as we had asked. Indeed, I welcome the ongoing publication of documents on the HSE website. I read the documents that were up last night. I note another one this morning. That is important but the concerns around ownership, control and governance of the new national maternity hospital remain, notwithstanding the changes and the publication of those documents. In particular, the key question everyone is asking is, if this is public ownership in all but name, why not move to public ownership? If a 299-year lease amounts effectively to State ownership, why do we not see a gifting of this site to the State, so that it is truly and beyond doubt within public ownership rather than this Byzantine series of legal arrangements? I have waded through these documents and they are complex. We have seen legal counsel previously describe these as labyrinthine complex arrangements, making it difficult to establish with certainty the issues of control and governance. These are legitimate concerns that have been raised, including concerns raised by two members of the HSE board. We understand they are legitimate concerns raised by women at the Cabinet table, as a result of which we are seeing this delay. These are legitimate questions and we are asking why we simply cannot move to public ownership.Why can we not request or require the site on which the hospital is to be built to be gifted to the State or, indeed, move to compulsorily purchase it? We in the Labour Party have been calling for a compulsory purchase order to be considered as an option since as long ago as 2017. That is five years ago. Had the State moved at that time, the site would now be in public ownership and we would not see these ongoing and real concerns around governance and control. There are valid concerns emerging from those documents on governance and control. There are valid and substantive concerns around the control issue when we look at who the directors will be and when we see that the landlord, the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, will have the right to appoint three directors to the new national maternity hospital designated activity company and, indeed, under the terms of the constitution of that company, will therefore have the right to appoint a chairperson in three years' time on a rotating basis. That means the landlord will have a very strong influence in how the tenant runs its affairs. That is a valid concern arising from the documents. There is also a valid concern around governance when one looks at the key phrase ""clinically appropriate"". It is in there twice in the constitution of the new company. It is also included in the operating licence and yet it is not present in the clause around the golden share of the Minister, clause 5.3 in the constitution which states the Minister's golden share is to ensure that the obligations are complied with and that any maternity, gynaecological, obstetric and-or neonatal services which are lawfully available in the State shall be available in the new national maternity hospital. Let us see that phrase used elsewhere and those qualifying and conditional words, ""clinically appropriate"", removed from the document. Otherwise we are going to continue to have these concerns around ownership, control and the governance of women's healthcare access."	spk_22

Positive changes have been made over the years, largely as a result of Opposition pressure and of pressure from activists and women seeking improvements in services and seeking to ensure we do indeed have a modern, world-class new national maternity hospital. Those concerns still remain, however. This State has an unfortunate and terrible legacy of failing women in our access to reproductive healthcare. It is only four years since we repealed the eighth amendment.

These are alarming figures. We know a major cause of homelessness is the lack of protection for renters against evictions and simply a lack of supply of sufficient homes for rental. In my constituency of Dublin Bay South, we have a particularly high proportion of households and individuals who are reliant on private rental accommodation. It is one of the reasons that last autumn, the first Bill I introduced in this House as a Deputy was a renters' rights Bill, which was legislation seeking to ensure greater security of tenure for tenants, in addition to ensuring better quality of life, better standards in rental accommodation and a three-year rent freeze to protect against the sort of dreadful hikes in rents we have seen. I ask the Taoiseach for an update as to whether and when we can see some of the principles in that legislation being brought into force.

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-04-28	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_31	I ask about a matter related to the serious and urgent question of how we in Ireland can best manage our collective response in offering support to those who have come here fleeing Russian brutality in Ukraine. This morning, Labour Party Deputies and Senators wrote to the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, who is taking overall responsibility for co-ordinating the national response. We wrote to offer our support in assisting with that national response and effort and to offer constructive engagement in highlighting issues that have arisen in cities, towns and communities around the country. We have copied that letter to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and also to the Taoiseach. We did so because we believe that in the face of war and barbarism and this brutal Russian aggression, our best outcomes will come from co-operation, constructive engagement and not from the sort of macho posturing and shouting that sometimes passes for democratic debate in this Chamber and about which the Ceann Comhairle has rightly been critical. In the spirit of constructive engagement we have welcomed the initiative of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, seeking support from Opposition parties in offering suggestions for vacant housing sites that could be used to house those coming here from Ukraine on a temporary basis. We have welcomed that call and are compiling a list of sites in conjunction with our network of local councillors around the country. We will be sending that list to the Minister. In my and the Minister's constituency of Dublin Bay South we will be proposing Baggot Street hospital, which has been mooted by my colleague, Councillor Dermot Lacey, and others, be utilised and that other vacant institutions such as, for example, the Avalon hostel on Aungier Street, could also be utilised for accommodation. There has been a really strong response in Ireland and the awful war has shown the people's generosity of spirit. However, issues have arisen that are not trivial and require a co-ordinated response. In particular, we want to know what format the newly announced Cabinet subcommittee on co-ordinating the Ukraine response will take. With respect to accommodation, what is the role of International Protection Accommodation Services, IPAS, compared with the role of local councils, in co-ordinating the accommodation of our Ukrainian guests? We have heard concerns at local level about access to safeguarding measures for women and children in congregated settings and access to primary healthcare, GPs and mental health supports. I am also hearing from local council officials of the need for a clear funding stream to enable councils to work with local and community voluntary groups to offer supports to Ukrainian guests and those who are hosting them here. I am thinking of the sort of networking events we have seen so successfully carried out in the Swan leisure centre in Rathmines and in other settings across the country where groups have come together on a voluntary basis to assist and support Ukrainian families and individuals coming here. We need that clear funding stream. As such, I would welcome a response from the Minister on that co-ordination of an approach to welcoming and showing support to Ukrainians.	spk_285

My colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, has raised a number of practical ways we can ensure a more co-ordinated national response because that is the issue. It is about co-ordinating the response and co-ordinating the national effort. The point the Minister made about IPAS is welcome. It is clear local authorities are stepping up in a huge way. They and council officials are dealing and will deal with a large number of front-line measures to support Ukrainian families and individuals coming here. However, they need clear funding streams to enable them to do that. They need flexibility in working with community and voluntary groups that have also stepped up. We also need to see supports in place for the Red Cross, which has taken on a huge responsibility in assessing the suitability of accommodation and has already reached out to other entities and agencies for support in that. There is, for example, a way in which current or retired community welfare officers could be engaged to help those seeking to access supports. Visiting the Ukraine support centre in Cork Street, I saw just how many civil and public servants are already doing that and offering that support. However, in recent weeks I visited a community hall in my and the Minister's constituency where families were sleeping on mats on the floor. Clearly, that is not ideal and it was only short-term but there is a real uncertainty about the national co-ordination of what should be a national and collective effort.	spk_287

There have been serious rises in the cost of renting in Ireland. Average monthly rents stand at €1,415 and at €2,000 in Dublin. That is an unaffordable chunk of take-home pay for many renters. The issue is lack of regulation and lack of supply. We in the Labour Party previously brought forward a Bill to restrict the use of companies like Airbnb for short-term lets. We are asking the Government to take more urgent action to ensure such short-term lets will not outstrip the supply of long-term lets.

As others have said, it is hugely important that we see regulation in place on the principle and the practice of GALs. Indeed, this is a Bill that has had a long genesis. The Minister alluded to that. A previous iteration of it fell in 2020. It is long overdue. I should say that I am somebody who, in practice as a barrister, represented GALs in quite a number of cases. I came to know several GALs very well and was hugely impressed by the way in which they carried out their work and by the enormous merit of the GAL process. All of us are conscious that GALs have been operating in an unsatisfactory legal context. There was little set out in law on their role or functions, and yet the seasoned and experienced GALs with whom I worked performed hugely important work in a very traumatic context. The State exercises one of the most extreme forms of State power when it takes a child into State care and away from his or her parents, who are often themselves in deeply traumatic circumstances and contexts. Obviously, huge issues have to be in place before the State would contemplate this. In these scenarios, GALs often act as an important bridge between parents and social workers. Indeed, they fulfil the important mechanism of conveying to the court what is in the child's best interests or, where the child is old enough, the child's own views. They provided a way of expressing those views and the voice of the child to the court in the years even before we passed the referendum to insert Article 42A into the Constitution, which now requires the voice and the views of the child to be heard. Therefore, GALs have been hugely important. In my experience, there has been greater concern in many child care proceedings where GALS have not been appointed. This can make court proceedings more difficult and often more protracted. I have seen GALs - sometimes this point is missed - perform a valuable function not only in the substantive conveying of the interests of the child and ensuring the child's interests are protected, but also in enabling the more efficient and effective functioning of child care courts. It is a much better way for a judge to come to make a decision where he or she is presented with a report from an experienced GAL and where the GAL is intervening to assist in the making of very difficult decisions around care proceedings. I say all of that not only to commend GALs but also to defend the system that is operating in spite of this legal vacuum without adequate legislative governance. I welcome the new provisions that will give us for the first time a proper statutory framework for the exercise of GAL powers because these are weighty powers and proceedings where we are talking about children being taken into care. I am conscious that this is not the final stage in regulating the practice of GALs. This morning, the Joint Committee on Gender Equality heard from the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, who discussed with us the new proposals around the family courts system in the context of measures to address the needs of survivors and victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. There is a real awareness among NGOs and any of us who have worked in the courts system of the current problems that arise where there is insufficient co-ordination between criminal courts and family courts. I refer, for example, to circumstances in which domestic violence issues are before the criminal courts and at the same time there are parallel proceedings in the family courts involving private family matters around custody of and access to a child. It is essential that there would be greater co-ordination in such circumstances. We should have a family court system that can deal with all of these questions together in a unified and co-ordinated fashion that is in the best interests of the survivors of abuse but also, of course, of children who are involved in such proceedings. I am conscious that, as the Minister has said, there will be fuller legislation coming forward, not only on the basis of the review of the childcare legislation that is being carried out but also on the basis of the overall reform of the family court system. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has talked about family hubs. In that context, it is worth mentioning one area where GALs are not involved. In private family disputes, we have often extremely protracted, difficult and traumatic proceedings going on around contested custody, guardianship, care and access arrangements in respect of a child. These are scenarios where many practitioners, judges, social workers and, indeed, parents might be of the view that it would be helpful to engage an independent impartial advocate for the child. Judges may, of course, seek reports, such as private reports and written reports, on children's views but it is very different from the GAL process. The Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, has expressed concern that children in private family law cases may not be getting the same opportunity to have their views expressed in court as children who are represented by GALs. Therefore, the question of extending a similar mechanism arises. Ms Freda McKittrick of Barnardos, which, of course, runs the country's largest GAL service, has spoken about the need for a family court welfare service - a one-stop shop - which would allow families to access a range of services and thereby enable more joined-up co-ordination when there are a number of different issues before the courts dealing with one particular family. This is part of the broader reform that the Ministers, Deputies O'Gorman and McEntee, have spoken about but it is an important context in which we are debating this particular legislation. As the Minister stated, the legislation has been welcomed by NGOs and experts alike and there will be longer term arrangements made to ensure the establishment of the new executive office, and this legislation is enabling the Minister to do that. Looking back at our recommendations from the pre-legislative scrutiny from the joint Oireachtas committee, I will address a couple of those points. Like Deputy Funchion, I was interested to hear what the Minister said about introducing a presumption rather than a mandatory appointment in all proceedings. I take the Minister's point that it may be a better way to ensure the voice and views of the child are heard but we will need to consider that further on Committee Stage because the GAL should be, and normally is, the best way of expressing a child's view. There may be cases, of course, where the child is an older teen and where that is not necessary. The way the Minister has framed the legislation means that the presumption will be displaced where the court is satisfied that it can determine other means by which to facilitate the expression by the child of his or her views. It may be necessary to spell out in a little more detail how that decision is to be made by a judge and that may be part of a broader reform involving more of an overarching family court welfare service. Another of the concerns the committee had and that we will need to address, perhaps on Committee Stage, is the appointment of a specific guardian  The issue of the access of the guardian to information from Tusla was raised at the committee. Section 35F gives the power to the court to order a report on the application by a guardian for same. Section 35G gives the guardian the power to request information from Tusla. I see there is a mechanism for the court to adjudicate when there is an issue about access to information. My own experience, and this is self-evident, is that the guardian process is at its most effective when full information is provided and, indeed, that is the practice because without that, the guardian cannot give a full report, particularly if the child involved is very young. I welcome the Bill. There is a lot of technical material in it that will be better dealt with on Committee Stage. However, I repeat that the guardian  I welcome the legislation and commend those who are currently involved in providing the important services guardians 	spk_438

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-04-27	dail	33	Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022: Report Stage	dbsect_21	As Deputy Funchion stated, this is an issue that came up extensively on Committee Stage. Indeed, we submitted an amendment to make a distinction between falsely or otherwise incorrectly. The Minister took that point on board. I, too, would welcome clarification on how amendment No. 2, tabled by the Minister, as well as his later amendments which I am delighted to see he has brought forward in respect of a review of incorrect or apparently incorrect birth registration, affect the point we made. We wanted to ensure there was a distinction between inadvertent false information and deliberately falsifying the information. It is that distinction between deliberate and inadvertent that we were trying to capture in our amendments. I know Deputy Funchion has tabled amendments on this. To some extent, the Minister stated on Committee Stage that he had brought forward an amendment similar to the one I tabled that addressed the issue. What Deputy Funchion and I welcome is that the Government amendments, taken together, would recognise the basic illegality of what has occurred. I did not submit my previous amendments on this point because I think that if all the Government amendments on this issue are accepted, the legislation will address this point. If I may look ahead to amendment No. 70, it provides that the Minister can authorise the agency and authority to conduct a review or trace, particularly in order to investigate whether there is evidence that a person has been the subject of an incorrect birth registration. It seems that some of the issues we raised have been addressed but we are seeking confirmation of that.	spk_332
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-04-27	dail	33	Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022: Report Stage	dbsect_21	I think all of us share that frustration about the language. We will have an opportunity, I think, to debate this issue further when we come to the later group of amendments concerning the new mechanism for the Minister to authorise the agency or authority to conduct a review or trace where a person believes he or she has been the subject of an incorrect birth registration. I hope we can revisit that point then. I think the concern we have is that, without being clear as to what is meant by incorrect birth registration, it may not capture the full experience of somebody who believes there has been a deliberate falsification of records. Our concern, in a nutshell, is to ensure that that experience can be captured, while appreciating, as the Minister says, that we do not want to set the bar too high and inadvertently exclude persons from the scope of the legislation. It is a matter of finding that balance of ensuring that people's real experiences are reflected in the legislation without creating any problems for the coverage that the legislation can afford to individuals.	spk_346

However, the amendments that are mine in this group in fact relate really to my substantive amendment No. 59, which is on the mandatory information session, so it may be better to address my comments when we come to that grouping as I know that this is a substantive point on which, again, we had a good deal of discussion on Committee Stage. Some of the amendments I have tabled that are in this grouping are technical amendments that would be consequent on the passage of my amendment No. 59, which would insert a new provision on effectively replacing the mandatory information session with a provision requiring the sending of a prepaid registered post or recorded delivery statement to a person seeking information. I want to put on record that there seems to be some crossover between the two groupings.	spk_356

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-04-27	dail	33	Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022: Report Stage	dbsect_21	I have tabled a number of amendments in this grouping. Most of them are technical. My substantive amendment is No. 59, which deals with the issue of the mandatory information session. This is the big sticking point for us with the Bill. I am very disappointed we did not see progress made on it on Committee Stage. We had a full debate with the Minister and I acknowledge how much progress was made on other issues on Committee Stage and since then. We all appreciate the improvements that have been made to the Bill. This is still a difficult point for us and for those seeking information. It means access to birth information remains conditional in certain cases on the holding of this information session. We all accept, as the Minister said on Committee and Second Stages, the need to balance information rights and privacy rights. For us the retention of the mandatory information session means privacy rights continue to trump identity rights. During the pre-legislative scrutiny the committee put forward a unanimous recommendation that an alternative to a mandatory information session as a safeguard to ensure the balance of rights would be sending an appropriate statement by registered post. In amendment No. 59 I have crafted a mechanism whereby such a statement could be sent by the authority, setting out the relevant matters in writing to a person seeking information. In my view this would be a sufficient safeguard, along with the other safeguards in the legislation such as the information campaign, the contact preference register and the age limit, to ensure these constitutional rights are balanced. It would be a more practical mechanism because it would ensure there could be no dispute as to what was said and whether a Zoom call or a meeting had in fact taken place. It would also show trust in the people seeking information that they would receive this statement and it would be sufficient. Since Committee Stage I looked again at section 17 to see what the Government proposes as a safeguard. The information session need not be in one place but it does require that each participant is able, directly or by means of electronic communications technology, to speak to and be heard by the other participants. It sets out in subsection (2) the relevant information about which the designated person is to inform the adopted person seeking the information. Why can this information not simply be set out in a written statement and sent by registered post so there is proof that it has been received? This is particularly so when section 17(4) requires the designated person, on completion of the information session, to confirm it has taken place and to provide notification. There is already in the Government's proposal a mechanism for a written statement. Why not bypass the mandatory information session and bypass this condition on access to information and, as the committee recommended as an ending of a rather paternalistic approach requiring an information session, simply send a statement by registered post? It is what we do with court summons and other important legal documents. We think this would be a far preferable method of informing somebody. It would mean there could be no condition on access. I asked the following on Committee Stage and still do not have a response. What if the adopted persons will not take the Zoom call or meet the designated person? It would mean they would not get access to the information, as I understand it. It is a condition upon access to information. This is against the spirit of the Bill, the otherwise inclusive text in the Bill and the great improvement the Bill makes to the very dated and patriarchal culture we all want to see changed. It has changed so much in so many other provisions of the Bill. It is most regrettable we have not seen movement on the information session. Amendment No. 59 in particular seeks to make this change and put into effect what the committee unanimously recommended during pre-legislative scrutiny.	spk_382
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-04-27	dail	33	Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022: Report Stage	dbsect_21	"All of us want to see the fundamental right to identity of adopted persons recognised and given effect in this legislation. That is absolutely the spirit in which I bring forward this amendment, supported by my colleagues. The Minister indicates this will only apply to a small number of persons but that is precisely the point. It will apply to those adopted persons who seek their birth information and whose birth parent has entered a ""no contact"" preference, as is their right. In such a case an adopted person who does not participate in this mandatory information session will not have access to the birth information, so it places a condition on access and it is discriminatory against a small number of adopted persons. I look again to what was said when the Bill had pre-legislative scrutiny. We said then that adopted people whose parent registers a ""no contact"" preference would under the Government proposal be singled out for differential treatment in a targeted warning about privacy rights. We also said that the mandatory information session was seen by some witnesses as compounding misguided fears about adopted people and perpetuating the injustice they have suffered for years, and that an alternative should be sought. It is clearly not for us to dispute or undermine a birth parent's right to enter a ""no contact"" preference but that entry should not then lead to a scenario where those adopted persons are singled out for particular treatment. My amendment seeks to give effect to our alternative safeguard proposal of a registered post letter and to apply it to all adopted persons. It would set out whether the birth parent's desire was to have contact, so it would not be discriminatory, but it would supply the information. It would supply it in a way that could be proven to have been received. For us this is about trust in adopted persons and trusting that an adopted person informed that the birth parent has entered a ""no contact"" preference will not seek to contact that parent. The reality is that under the Government's proposal an adopted person in such a case who participates in an information session will receive the information. There is no block on the information and the process does not safeguard the birth parent's privacy to that extent. We are all agreed on that. As the Minister has said, we have moved on. I proposed a somewhat similar version of this some years ago when working with the Minister's predecessor, former Deputy Katherine Zappone, to try to achieve workable legislation that would finally give effect to adopted persons' identity rights.At that point, the Attorney General advised that even that was not possible, and that a statutory declaration would have to be signed by an adopted person, because there was so little trust in adopted persons. The Minister is right in saying we have moved on from that. Our culture of ""restrict, do not release"" has happily changed. However, section 17 of this Bill remains a last vestige of that outdated culture and lack of trust. I know the Minister has tried to move it on. We tried to move it on Committee Stage. We believed we had achieved a compromise that would provide a safeguard for respecting privacy rights and a proven mechanism for saying the information was received by the adopted person, without singling out adopted persons whose birth parents had entered a particular no-contact preference. We have all moved on. We believe the registered post option is now the best option, and should be acceptable in our new culture in which we know a lot more about identity rights, in which EU law has moved on, and in which we are better achieving mechanisms for the balancing of rights. It is in that vein I say I still have no response to my question. What if an adopted person in this small category, whose birth parents entered a no-contact preference, does not wish to participate in an information session? They will not have access to birth information, and that is unfair. "	spk_386

I referred to them previously, as the Minister said. They provide for important new mechanisms for a person who has reasonable grounds for suspecting they are the subject of an incorrect birth registration to initiate the conduct of inquiries by the agency or authority. They also empower the Minister to conduct a review. I acknowledge the work of the special rapporteur, Dr. Conor O'Mahony, and those very brave individuals who themselves were the subject of illegal adoptions and who went public with their experiences in such a powerful way to expose this awful practice that had gone on for far too long. I acknowledge the Minister's move on this and indeed his change in light of the amendment I put in to reflect the point on ""false or misleading"" in respect of birth registration. I welcome that this change was made on Committee Stage, as we said earlier. These amendments really will provide additional supports and comfort to those who have been the subject of illegal birth registrations, which is very welcome. I am disappointed, however, that we have not seen any similar movement on the mandatory information session. I know we have debated the matter and I also called a vote on it. Deputies Funchion, Cairns and I have acknowledged the movement and improvement that has been made to the legislation through the course of the legislative process. I am conscious that the Bill still has to go to the Seanad. I wonder if it would be possible for the mandatory information session to be reviewed again by the Minister, his colleagues and the Attorney General in light of the strong views expressed not just by me as the proposer of amendment No. 59 on the replacement of the mandatory information session but indeed by other colleagues too. I wonder if it could just be looked again to see if there is any other appropriate mechanism that could be inserted. We have seen a very sweeping, welcome change made, particularly in amendment No. 70, which I agree is really significant, empowering the Minister to authorise the agency and authority to conduct a review in this scenario to establish whether a person has been the subject of an illegal birth registration. This is a big change to the law and a very welcome one. Is it possible to see a way to making a similar change to the mandatory information session in section 17 between now and the conclusion of the Bill through the legislative process in the Seanad?"	spk_448

It provides for a more inclusive approach, which is very welcome. So much of the Bill is welcome, and so many of the amendments are welcome. We have welcomed all the Minister's amendments, I believe. There is just the one sticking point left, namely, the provision in section 17. It is a very significant difficulty for us. This is a Bill that my party and I really want to support. Undoubtedly, it will result in considerable progress regarding the rights of adopted persons to know their own identity and access the sort of birth information that is routinely available to the adopted persons in other jurisdictions. Our concern, mentioned in our pre-legislative scrutiny report, is that Ireland will remain an outlier if, through what section 17 proposes, we continue to place a condition on access to birth information, even for a small category of adopted persons. If there could be some movement on this between now and the passage of the Bill in the Seanad, it would be really welcome. I do not want to have to oppose the Bill at all because it is so welcome. I commend the Minister and his officials on the enormous progress made. As I said earlier and on Committee Stage, I am so aware of the enormous difficulties we have had in trying to get to this stage with the legislation. There have been many iterations of the Attorney Generals' advice on this over the years. There is just this one final hurdle; so many others have been cleared. While there has been so much goodwill and meeting of minds on changes that improved the Bill greatly, and while so many have had an input, including all the witnesses who gave evidence to the joint committee, particularly Professor Conor O'Mahony, and the Minster's officials and the Attorney General, there is just the one remaining sticking point. It is really a vestige of a dated culture. As the Minister put it himself, there was a ""restrict, not release"" culture that always saw privacy rights trumping identity rights and that saw distrust of women and children. We all know that culture should be long gone and we do not want to see any more vestiges of it in our legislation. For us, the sticking point concerning the mandatory information session still remains. It retains too much of the past culture in the Bill. It does not fit. Given the many improvements to the Bill since we began debating it, including amendment No. 73 and those ministerial amendments we have just agreed to, section 17 will come to be seen as an outlier. Indeed, it could well form the basis of litigation by those adopted persons in that small category to which I have referred, whose birth parents, as was their right, indicated a no-contact preference. An adopted person in that scenario who does not engage in the mandatory information session will not then have access under this legislation to his or her birth information. Therefore, such adoptees may well see it as discriminatory against them. That discrimination is built into the Bill, and that is what we are objecting to. I realise we have had an opportunity to debate it; however, in light of the other significantly progressive and welcome amendments, it stands out as an obstacle to supporting the Bill in its entirety."	spk_462

They illustrate the complexity of the situation and the history that lies behind the Bill. They show why so much thought needs to be put into transferring records and the sources for records and information, given the very piecemeal history of adoption legislation and practices in Ireland. I want to refer to the Minister's comment on my use of the term ""outlier"". That word was used in our pre-legislative scrutiny report. When we spoke about the mandatory information session, the committee said that in the international context, Ireland will remain an outlier with the conditional access proposed in the Bill. That was a term used in the report and that is why I used it today. It is unfortunate we could not move further, given where we are now and how much movement there has been on so much more, including in amendments Nos. 75 and 76. The fact that section 17 remains in its current form is, as I have said, out of keeping with the general spirit and tone elsewhere in the Bill and the amendments the Minister has put forward, which we have all welcomed and which have made such improvements to the Bill."	spk_468

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-04-26	dail	33	Social Dialogue	dbsect_12	I previously raised with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste the urgent need for an increase in the national minimum wage to address the cost-of-living crisis confronting households. With inflation rising, it is clear Ireland needs a pay rise and that people need to see the pay in their pockets go further. The 30 cent increase in the minimum wage that came into effect in January has simply not been enough to address the rising costs facing our lowest paid workers. Ireland is a high-cost and low-pay economy, and this is putting great pressure on working people. In our submission to the Low Pay Commission this year, the Labour Party argued for an immediate increase of €1 in the minimum wage and for a clear, multi-annual pathway to deliver a living wage within three years. Has the social dialogue unit examined, or can it examine urgently, the need for an emergency increase in the minimum wage? Have any such proposals been tabled with the Labour Employer Economic Forum, to which the Taoiseach referred, to consider bringing a request to the Low Pay Commission to bring forward any such increase? Could the Taoiseach also indicate if it is intended to bring forward legislation to provide for a living wage? In response to a question I put to the Tánaiste just before the Easter break, he raised this prospect. Will the Taoiseach confirm what the Government's plans are? It is clear we must see an effective increase in the pay people receive to meet this enormous increase in the cost of living.	spk_325

We want to see a process involving citizens' assemblies, approved by both the Oireachtas and the Assembly in Stormont, as a means of exploring how a united Ireland can be achieved on a truly consensual basis and by agreement across the island. I ask whether the Taoiseach agrees with that proposal, and with the concept of dialogue specifically dedicated to discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and other unions.	spk_299
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-04-26	dail	33	Social Dialogue	dbsect_14	I previously raised with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste the urgent need for an increase in the national minimum wage to address the cost-of-living crisis confronting households. With inflation rising, it is clear Ireland needs a pay rise and that people need to see the pay in their pockets go further. The 30 cent increase in the minimum wage that came into effect in January has simply not been enough to address the rising costs facing our lowest paid workers. Ireland is a high-cost and low-pay economy, and this is putting great pressure on working people. In our submission to the Low Pay Commission this year, the Labour Party argued for an immediate increase of €1 in the minimum wage and for a clear, multi-annual pathway to deliver a living wage within three years. Has the social dialogue unit examined, or can it examine urgently, the need for an emergency increase in the minimum wage? Have any such proposals been tabled with the Labour Employer Economic Forum, to which the Taoiseach referred, to consider bringing a request to the Low Pay Commission to bring forward any such increase? Could the Taoiseach also indicate if it is intended to bring forward legislation to provide for a living wage? In response to a question I put to the Tánaiste just before the Easter break, he raised this prospect. Will the Taoiseach confirm what the Government's plans are? It is clear we must see an effective increase in the pay people receive to meet this enormous increase in the cost of living.	spk_325
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-04-26	dail	33	Home Heating Fuels: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_18	We know the spike in the cost of living is hurting households throughout Ireland as inflation has surged to a 22-year high of 6.7% and looks set to continue its increase. We see the cost of fuel, food, housing and basic services is now out of control. Everyone is feeling the pinch, most of all those who are already struggling to make ends meet. The horrendous war in Ukraine has undoubtedly added to this crisis, but many of the reasons underlying this spike are structural in nature, and measures such as the untargeted €200 energy stipend the Government provided for earlier this year are not the answer. We say the Government response to the cost-of-living crisis simply does not go far enough, but we also believe the measures proposed by Sinn Féin in this motion are not the answer either, and I will set out why. Instead, we in the Labour Party believe Ireland needs a pay rise. What does that mean? It means ensuring we can put money back in the pockets of those who need it most, that people's incomes will go further, and the pay they are currently getting will be able to keep up with the necessary expenditure they have. It means implementing an effective universal pay rise and increasing the minimum wage but also targeting the enormous costs now faced now by so many households, such as costs of education, childcare, housing, health and transport. Ireland needs a pay rise because all of us meet people every day whose income is simply no longer enough to keep up with the rising price of commodities and the basic services that they need. We all hear from constituents living in genuine fear that they will not be able to continue to keep their homes, heat their homes or put food on the table. We need a co-ordinated response to this. Addressing the cost-of-living crisis means taking progressive measures to make people's pay go further and adding value, not undermining important investments in our future, such as in the area of climate action. We know what is at stake. We have all heard the chilling prognosis of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, and we know the solutions to the existential threat of the climate emergency are available to us. Our task as legislators is to implement them and to do so without delay. I want to speak specifically about the Government plans on the sale of turf and peat. This has not been handled well by Government. We have seen endless mixing of messages, confusion and lack of clarity. As the Minister has said, the final regulations have still not been agreed by Government. We are debating today in a vacuum. Indeed, a debate is going on in the public domain in a vacuum because we have not seen what is to be in the detail of the regulations. It is welcome to hear that a fair balance will be struck to ensure the rights of those who are reliant on peat burning for their heating on a small scale will be met. The Minister has pointed out that a balance will be struck between the need to reduce emissions and improve air quality and respecting the traditional activity of citizens' turf cutting for their own use in rural areas. That fair balance would be welcome but we have not seen the detail of it. We are conscious the Government needs to do more to support people, especially those in rural Ireland who are dependent on peat for home heating. In recent weeks, we have seen some dangerous equivocation between large-scale commercial mining and smaller domestic use. However, people's genuine fears and concerns about heating their own homes are not unfounded and our call is now to fast-track applications for retrofitting by prioritising households that are currently reliant on turf for home heating. Furthermore, we call on Government to explore the possible creation of a temporary band with a higher income threshold for accessing the fuel allowance, even at a reduced rate. This change would also widen access for households to the warmer homes scheme. Many of us hear of households that are missing out on that scheme and the fuel allowance by a mere handful of euro above the current eligibility rate. We cannot afford to maintain the  I acknowledge the considerable importance of the issue of air pollution, and indeed the pandemic experience of the past two years has brought into sharp focus the importance of respiratory health and the need for measures to improve air quality. Nearly 20 years ago, the introduction of the smoking ban was an important health policy milestone, and we know that approximately 7,000 deaths have been prevented due to the reduction in passive smoke inhalation brought about by that progressive law. By contrast, we are still failing in our public health approach on air pollution from the burning of solid fuel. We know from estimates available to us that approximately 1,300 people die annually in Ireland due to the effects of air pollution from that burning of solid fuel. That is four people every day. The World Health Organization has described air pollution as the world's single biggest environmental risk. For public health reasons, as well as for climate reasons, we must phase out the burning of these materials. My colleague, Deputy Kelly, began the process of introducing a nationwide ban on smoky coal in 2015. Despite subsequent attempts to make it happen from Opposition, some within Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have unfortunately resisted further measures on that policy. I am old enough to recall the days in the 1980s when you could see the pollution in the air in Dublin as a result of the burning of smoky coal. Anyone who remembers that will know the considerable improvements we have seen in our air quality as a result of progressive measures to tackle that. However, the attempts to resist introduction of policies on air quality improvement have resulted in a sort of phony urban-rural war unfortunately being whipped up by some backbenchers in government. We need to move past this unhelpful narrative because we know that for the health of both urban and rural households and communities we need to phase out the burning of smoky coal, peat and wood that has not been dried properly in tandem with providing real supports for people of the sort I have outlined in terms of accelerated retrofitting and expanded access to fuel allowance. We need an all-island strategy on air pollution in recognition of the contribution made by the importation of smoky coal from Northern Ireland. I hope Sinn Féin, as well as Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, will reflect on this as we approach the assembly elections next week in the North. On the climate emergency, I have already referenced the recent IPCC report. Those of us on the red-green left know the need for measures to tackle the climate and biodiversity emergency and drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is why we in the Labour Party have supported, with some reservations, Government retrofitting plans and the carbon tax. It is also why we cannot support any further delay on an increase in the carbon tax. This is the second motion Sinn Féin has tabled in two months which has sought, at a minimum, to scrap carbon tax increases. With such a focus in parliamentary activity, it is hard to escape the conclusion that Sinn Féin as a party is not serious about climate action. The evidence is clear.Properly targeted carbon taxes can help in reducing emissions and in redistributing wealth to ensure polluters pay. Therefore, the Labour Party has called for new, targeted carbon tax credits to accompany the carbon tax, combined with targeted increases in fuel allowance eligibility and social welfare payments. Over time, the credit could be phased out as homes are retrofitted and renewable energy generation increases. Carbon tax is clearly not the only mechanism to tackle the climate emergency - far from it - and neither is it the only reason for an increase in the cost of fuel. The same can be said for mining sod turf for commercial sale. We need other measures. We must ramp up retrofitting, promote active and sustainable transport and build our infrastructure to ensure electric vehicles are a real option for people living in more remote areas. We also need targeted financial supports for households on lower incomes, for renters living in poorly insulated homes and for people locked into dependence on unsustainable fields. Equally, we need ring-fenced carbon tax revenues to complement our investment in a just transition. Therefore, to the drafters of this motion and to those in government seeking to undermine climate policies, a just transition does not mean delaying action until we have passed the point at which climate disaster has become irreversible. Under that model, we would see the catastrophic consequences of inaction weigh worst on those who have the least. It would be a false economy in the truest sense of the term. A just transition presents immense opportunities and it can provide for a genuine redistribution of wealth throughout the country. We are awaiting the launch of the national consultation on the national hydrogen strategy. I have called for this before. A green hydrogen strategy has the potential to enable Ireland to be a leader in decarbonising heavy industries and in addressing long-standing energy security concerns, which have been brought into sharper focus by the terrible war in Ukraine. We can be a leader in the generation and export of clean energy and create clean and decent jobs for workers. We can do this through enhancing our wind energy capacity and through our retrofitting adaptation and carbon capture policies, as well as through the green hydrogen approach. Just as we did during the Covid-19 pandemic, we must trust the science. The mantra when we hear about climate change is that we must be honest about the nature of this crisis. A carbon tax and an end to the large-scale commercial sale of turf must form part of our national strategy to incentivise climate-friendly behaviour and to fund the necessary infrastructure to aid in the just transition I spoke about. We know polluters must pay, but that argument does not exempt us all from responsibility. Lending our voices to constructive proposals is a better use of parliamentary time than seeking to convince constituents that delaying climate action is the answer to their problems. The Dáil and Seanad are set to use three time slots this week to debate if we should do away with the albeit modest gains we have made for climate action. This would not be a good use of our time or of the platforms given to us by those who elect us. Therefore, I would prefer these opportunities for constructive debate, and I hope colleagues on both sides of the House will adopt that strategy too.	spk_350

The Central Bank of Ireland has projected that inflation is set to continue rising. Households are already squeezed financially and look set to be even further squeezed by this rise in inflation, given the rising costs of fuel, food and other commodities. As ever, these price rises and this increase in inflation will hit those on lowest incomes the hardest. The Labour Party, however, believes the State can take action to address the hardships so many households are now facing. The reality is that for too long we have been a low-wage republic. We are saying that Ireland needs a pay rise. Far too many workers are on low pay. Ireland has one of the highest rates of low pay in Europe and the OECD, with 23% of people on low rates of pay. This is compounded by the rising cost of living. It is especially the case in Dublin, where we are seeing out-of-control rents and high costs for goods and services, as well as for early years education and childcare, which is leaving many households struggling to make ends meet and even to heat their homes and to put food on their tables. The Labour Party believes the best way to address this issue is to seek a way to increase take-home pay for working people and families. One way we can do this is to strengthen employees' power to negotiate pay rates and salaries and conditions with their employers. As a lifelong trade unionist, I believe we need to strengthen collective-bargaining rights and the ability of workers to negotiate these improved pay rates and conditions to ensure real and sustainable increases in income. The State can also examine the national minimum wage. It is still only €10.50 per hour and this is significantly below the living wage figure of €12.90 per hour. We believe that a targeted emergency increase in the minimum wage would be one way of addressing the serious squeeze that the increases in the cost of living and the rising rate of inflation is putting on so many households on low incomes. People need a living-wage income. At the very minimum, they need an increase in the national minimum wage rate. We also believe that we must then set a pathway to achieving a genuine living wage rate. Indeed, I note that the programme for Government of this Government promises to ""Progress to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government"", which means there is a "	spk_232
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-04-07	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_31	I will agree with the Tánaiste on one thing, which is that statistics can be used in all sorts of ways. Relativities are important. When one quotes statistics on wages, the key issue for everyone feeling it in their pockets is purchasing power, the actual relativity between take-home pay and the cost of living. Let us not forget that in Ireland we are paying for many things that other European countries provide for free, such as early years education and care and healthcare, particularly for children. We have higher costs for education and in many sectors than in other countries. The minimum wage has only increased by €1.35 in the last six years despite faster economic growth and higher inflation. We are clearly seeing a national minimum wage that has not kept pace with inflation. That has really caused a particularly difficult and tough squeeze on those households that are most in need and suffering most as we see the spiralling rate of inflation.	spk_234

A Cheann Comhairle, we have been honoured to listen to President Zelenskyy's powerful address on behalf of his people today. On behalf of the Labour Party I pay tribute to his immense courage under fire and I also want to pay special tribute to our friend, the Ukrainian Ambassador to Ireland, H.E. Larysa Gerasko, for her steadfast advocacy on behalf of her country. Fáilte romhat, Ambassador. As the brutal Russian invasion continues, we learned this week about the carrying out of horrific war crimes in Bucha, about the ongoing and appalling siege of civilians in Mariupol and the atrocities that have been committed by Russian forces across the Ambassador's peaceful and democratic country. These reports have horrified us all and show the need for an intensification of our collective response. While we in the Labour Party welcome the news of a fifth round of EU sanctions, and last week welcomed the expulsion of four diplomatic staff from the Russian embassy here, we believe now that stronger measures need to be taken. Indeed, President Zelenskyy has called upon us to do that and has told us that our leadership can make a difference. We are calling now for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador from Ireland as he continues to mount brazen denials of the truth of what is happening in Ukraine and what his government is doing to the people of Ukraine.	spk_15

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine	dbsect_3	We are calling for strong support for Ukraine's expedited accession to the EU; a full embargo on Russian oil and gas to join with the welcome move on coal; urgent initiation of investigations into Russian war crimes against civilians, including crimes of sexual violence against women about which we are hearing such appalling reports; the speedy passage into law of Deputy Howlin’s Magnitsky legislation that we in the Labour Party pushed for and brought forward in this House last December; the exclusion of remaining Russian banks from the SWIFT system and measures to ensure that secondary sanctions cannot be sidestepped; and a ban on all Russian ships docking in Irish ports in a week when we see worrying reports of a Russian-registered vessel docking in Dublin Port this week. Let us be clear. Putin has shown that he wants to wipe Ukraine off the map. He wants to abolish Ukraine's culture and its history. Putin must fail and will fail. At the outset of this illegal and brutal invasion nearly six weeks ago, I called a protest against the Russian Embassy. I called then for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador and I spoke about our solidarity as Irish people with Ukraine. Since then the solidarity here in Ireland has strengthened. We have seen it evident at the funeral of the brave journalist, Pierre Zakrzewski, who died in Ukraine, killed by Russian forces. We have seen it in communities across Ireland who have rolled out such a warm welcome and have offered sanctuary to so many refugees fleeing terror and war in Ukraine. We continue to show that solidarity and it is real. We stand with Ukraine now as you battle barbarism. We will stand with you as Ukraine is rebuilt, as we see the cities of Mariupol, Bucha, Kharkiv and Sumy being rebuilt and as an independent and united Ukraine becomes part of a better, stronger Europe. We stand with you in your current struggles and in your hardship and devastation. We will be with you as you rebuild your country which is so close to our hearts and so close to the future of Europe.We stand with you, Ukraine. 	spk_18

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-04-06	dail	33	Carbon Budget: Motion	dbsect_11	Our global climate and biodiversity crises are existential and fundamental to our capacity to live and to the survival of our planet, but it is not all doom and gloom and we should never feel powerless. It is good to have this opportunity to debate carbon budgets, given that we have just seen the IPCC's report with its chilling prognosis but also a reminder that we can still act to avoid a climate catastrophe. We have many of the solutions already. From agriculture to transport, we know what we have to do.The first Bill I ever published, when I was first elected to the Oireachtas 15 years ago, sought to impose a cap on Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions. It was the first Bill of its kind in Ireland. Although that took place relatively recently, it seems a lifetime ago in terms of understanding the urgency of the crisis we are in. The IPCC report emphasises we are currently on a path to exceed 2°C warming worldwide, which could result in enormous loss of life, livelihoods, biodiversity and food security. The clear and stark message from that report, and I raised this with the Taoiseach during Leaders' Questions on Tuesday, is the need to take action. All of us are encouraged by the activism we see in the engagement of younger generations, in particular, who are driving the charge on climate justice through the school strikes movement, the Youth Climate Assembly and many of their campaigns. I was proud to stand with many of them at the most recent global school strike on 25 March. This is a cause that hits close to home for young people in Ireland because they know, as we do, that this is about our children and grandchildren. We are already running through their carbon budgets, spending their resources, destroying their planet and moving in the wrong direction. Just last weekend we saw the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, confirm the extent to which Ireland's emissions are heading in the wrong direction. We learned that emissions from electricity alone rose by 21% last year undoing the small progress we had achieved in previous years. The EPA branded this directional move as disappointing, which is patently an understatement.  We need to ensure real and urgent action is taken to implement the measures we have already put into law and that we very much welcomed and supported through our ambitious climate targets. The adoption of carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings form part of that effort. We have called for this to be a whole-of-government measure with economic and environmental planning taking place in parallel. In that spirit, we are glad to endorse and support the first two budgets being put to the House today. I am very grateful to the different voluntary groups and NGOs that have been in contact with all of us, and with the Government, in recent weeks and have worked so hard to see those budgets improved and adopted, while recognising they are not sufficiently aligned with Paris Agreement commitments and do not constitute Ireland's fair share. I pay special tribute to Friends of the Earth, the Stop Climate Chaos coalition and the Just Transition Alliance for their constructive campaigning and activism. I welcome the commitment the Minister of State made in his speech to the establishment of a just transition commission. The delays in its establishment have fed into a sense of a lack of sufficient urgency from the Government in taking the necessary steps to meet our emissions reduction targets. I also referred in my remarks to the Taoiseach on Tuesday not only to the delay in the establishment of that commission, which is so critical in bringing measures forward, but to inefficient governance through the lack of meetings of the climate action delivery board. I asked the Taoiseach whether that board met yet this year, noting that it has only met once in 2021. Turning again to the budgets before us, I note, as have others, there is a degree of backloading of our reductions between 2025 and 2030. I acknowledge this is to facilitate the adoption of new policies and practices but, again, we need to see a greater sense of urgency in these budgets. The IPCC was clear that there is a very small window of three years to meet targets. We know the effects of global warming are cumulative, so we will be worse off for not taking quick action now. The adoption of reductions must happen on the understanding there is no room for any additional backloading of emissions reductions. It is imperative we do not overshoot the first carbon budget. These should not be seen as targets but, rather, a floor beneath which we cannot fall. It would be morally unconscionable to pass the clear tipping points the IPCC has identified, which would trigger larger-scale changes in Earth's systems and a loss of biodiversity, with many species already on the ready on the brink of extinction. I will turn to the third carbon budget proposed from 2031 to 2035. I note this budget remains provisional. This budget needs to be improved upon in order that we can achieve net zero as quickly as possible, while noting that the law states 2050 is the latest target and some countries have adopted net zero targets earlier than 2050. The reasoning behind the adoption of these earlier targets by other countries should form part of the Climate Change Advisory Council research in finalising the measures for the third budget. Looking at those other countries, Sweden, Portugal and Germany have set a zero target date of 2045 in law. Finland and Austria have set earlier targets in policy of 2035 and 2040, respectively. The adoption by other EU states of these earlier net zero target dates shows us what can and may be done. The Labour Party prepared an amendment to this motion, which would have had the effect of declining to approve the third carbon budget for that five-year period of 2031 to 2035 on the basis of the need to ensure greater research on this. Unfortunately, we were out of time with that amendment but I will put forward the logic that lay behind our proposed amendment to the Minister of State. While the Climate Change Advisory Council put forward a reduction rate of only 3.5% from 2031 to 2035 for this provisional third budget, this presupposed a linear path from 2030 to net zero by 2050. To return to the previous point, our climate law stipulates net zero by 2050 at the latest. We believe there should have been steeper and faster cuts built in. Our view, shared by Friends of the Earth, is the council should take into account the principle of climate justice about which our former President, Mary Robinson, has spoken so clearly. It should also have taken into account the obligations of the Paris Agreement, including the principle of common but differentiated responsibility in drawing up this third carbon budget proposal. Climate law sets a legal requirement for the CCAC to consider climate justice and the principle of Ireland's fair share in line with the further principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. We believe that, based on what the CCAC has already published, more research and analysis should be built into informing the finalisation of the third carbon budget and, indeed, a provisional fourth carbon budget. I am sorry we did not have the opportunity to table that amendment but I want to put that on the record, although we support the earlier budgets. We in Ireland must do our fair share. This comes back to the point about responsibility and, in particular, global responsibility. We have spoken extensively in both Houses in recent months about the cost-of-living crisis and what needs to be done to alleviate the burden on ordinary people and on every household in Ireland. We know that the cost-of-living crisis, the energy security crisis as a result of the horrific war in Ukraine and the climate emergency are all strongly interlinked. Households throughout the country are struggling to meet the costs of housing, transport, childcare and more, in addition to rising energy and fuel costs. We are, however, a country that can do much more to support those who need supports with targeted measures while, in parallel, continuing on our path to end our reliance on fossil fuels. Some say Ireland is too small to made a difference but, looking at the global reality, 111 countries are the same size or smaller than Ireland. If they all said they were too small to make a difference, we would never reach global climate emissions reduction targets. We need to do more in this country at every level and in all sectors. We speak every week about this but I was struck, in particular, by the recent words of Professor Kevin Anderson who addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action. He contended that reaching a globally fair and equitable system of emissions cuts would require Ireland to reach net zero by 2029. This is much earlier than even those other European countries are proposing as their net zero dates. It is in that context that I emphasise we accept the need to pass these budgets without delay but to do so in a manner that will make it possible for us to improve upon our implementation and strategies to reach net zero. We are told that without immediate and deep carbon emissions reductions across all sectors, it will not be possible to limit global warming to 1.5°C this century. Three years ago, noting the crisis we were in, this House voted to declare a climate emergency, but last weekend we learned from the UN IPCC just how critical this timing now is and how crucial it is that we act urgently, without any further delay, to implement the necessary measures. We have the targets in law. We need to do more to ensure they are reached before that very latest date of 2050 we have set for ourselves.	spk_301

The Labour Party and I believe that the Government response to the climate emergency has unfortunately been characterised by too many delays, an inadequacy of governance and a failure to address the clear interconnection between the climate crisis, the energy security crisis, which has been exacerbated by the horrific war in Ukraine, and the cost of living crisis that is biting so deep into so many households across our communities. At the weekend, we heard very worrying news regarding emissions here. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, confirmed the extent to which our emissions are heading in the wrong direction and the extent to which we are seeing delays in ensuring that we are moving to meet our emissions reduction targets. We learned that emissions from electricity alone rose by 21% last year. The EPA branded this as disappointing, which is patently an understatement because this is clearly not the direction of travel in which we so urgently need to be going. Last week, I raised with the Taoiseach the Labour Party's concerns about Ireland's over-reliance on imported gas - another sign of moving in the wrong direction - which will only worsen if we proceed to build eight new gas-fired electricity plants by 2024, particularly when we have no clarity as to from where the gas to power them will come. What we need to see urgently are dramatic reductions in fossil fuel reliance, rapid increases in our renewable capacity and usage and rapid moves to electrification of heat, transport and other sectors, along with drastic action on retrofitting and active travel infrastructure and a national green hydrogen strategy, for which I have been calling for some time. If we do not take these urgent actions, we know from the IPCC that the consequences will be catastrophic, we will fail to keep global temperatures below 1.5°C and that the chance to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis will be lost. This is an immediate and critical issue for us in Ireland. As I have said, all we have seen is delays and an inadequacy in governance. Will the Taoiseach accept that we have a problem with rising emissions and that emissions are going in the wrong direction? Will he confirm the establishment immediately of a just transition commission to manage our transition to a decarbonised future, as the Just Transition Alliance has sought, and to ensure that our transition to decarbonisation is carried out in a fair and just way that will not adversely impact on those who are most severely affected by the cost-of-living crisis, the energy security crisis and the enormous hikes we have seen in energy bills for so many people in recent weeks? I am looking for an answer on the just transition commission in particular, but I also want to know where the gas for the eight new power plants that are projected to be built will come from.	spk_39

I agree that there is a need to be honest and constructive in this debate. My party is serious about the environment and ensuring we take the urgent actions necessary to meet our ambitious targets.

Indeed, the IPCC has clearly pointed out to us just how urgent it is that we start to take the necessary actions to meet our targets. However, our concern is that there simply is not sufficient urgency in the Government's responses. We need governance structures to be put in place to enable us to meet those targets. I asked about the just transition commission. I am also asking about the climate action delivery board, which, I understand, failed to meet more than once last year. Has that board met in the past three months? If so, who attended? We need to get the governance right in order to ensure that we can meet those ambitious targets that we so urgently need to meet if we are to save the planet for our children and grandchildren. I agree with what the Taoiseach said about honesty and constructive debate. I am trying to engage in constructive debate, but I would like to hear some answers on governance.	spk_41

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-04-05	dail	33	Childcare Fees: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_20	"I move amendment No. 1:To insert the following after ""regardless of the outcome of the Joint Labour Committee"":""— guarantee a pre-school place for every child; and— begin the rollout of a universal public childcare system.""I welcome this motion and commend Deputy Funchion on her work on it. I acknowledge the Minister's breakthrough in securing such an increase in funding and his vision in setting out some necessary reforms of the early years education and care system. Labour believes neither the motion nor the core funding stream proposed go far enough and more could be done. In that spirit, we have put forward the addendum to the motion agreeing with what is in the motion but calling further on the Government to guarantee a preschool place for every child and begin the roll-out of a universal public childcare system. That addendum, which I hope will not be opposed, seeks to strengthen the commitments made by the Minister and by Deputy Funchion and her colleagues in putting forward the motion. The current system of early years education and care provision in Ireland is failing parents, staff in the sector, providers and, most of all, children who are not getting an equal start in life. We in Labour want to see a total restructuring of the sector to provide for the creation of a system of universal and public childcare. We think the core funding stream provides an important and long overdue building block and starting point for the sector but more needs to be done. Like all of us, I hear daily from parents who are deeply concerned about the cost of childcare and crèches and about the lack of certainty as to whether or not fees will be frozen or, preferably, reduced. It is acknowledged in the motion that if they were to be frozen it would be at an unsustainably high level for many parents. I commend the Minister for delivering on the €221 million core funding stream and acknowledge the commitment to ensuring €138 million of that will go towards improving pay and conditions for early years educators. I commend SIPTU's Big Start campaign that has been actively engaged in seeking to strengthen the pay and conditions of educators. While we want to see more ambition for the early years sector, we appreciate that, pending the success of the joint labour committee, the new core funding stream can offer a base upon which to build a better system with better outcomes. We believe, as the motion says, that the Minister should commit to increasing wages and addressing the fees issue, regardless of the outcome of the process. As per our amendment, we believe a meaningful process should be initiated and committed to to guarantee a place for every child and introduce the system of universal public childcare that we badly need. The spiralling fees we hear about daily from parents would be unsustainable in any case but, given the cost of living crisis with serious rises in inflation, increases in housing and rental costs and, for many people, unaffordable prices in fuel, energy and food, it is a particularly difficult time to be looking at such high childcare costs. Ireland has the second highest OECD household spend on childcare. Couples spend an average of 24% of their income, and single parents 29%, on fees. Parents in Dublin pay around €1,000 per month per child. Any of us who have had children in childcare in Dublin, including in my constituency, are aware of that cost of €1,000 or more. That is if we can get a place. I am hearing of many parents who have to book childcare places in anticipation of a child's birth and women and parents who cannot get a childcare place and are worried about whether or not they can return to work. They wish to do so but are being stifled in their career progression. With approximately 300,000 children in the preschool age group and around two thirds of them using some form of childcare service, this is a major crisis. As a minimum, a fee freeze is necessary but we agree with the motion that a reduction would be preferable. On wages and pay and conditions, I have already paid tribute to SIPTU's Big Start campaign. We saw this year's report on pay, conditions and job satisfaction of early years professionals showing again that those tasked with educating our children at this key developmental stage are among the most undervalued workers in society. The Minister acknowledged that and we are all well aware of it. Pay is well below a living wage for many educators, who often also lack basic rights like sick pay and maternity pay. This came to the fore in the Government's sick pay proposal, for which we have called for some time. My colleague, Senator Sherlock, has been to the fore on that. We are concerned that those working in the early childhood care and education sector, because many of them are seasonal and employed for part of the year, will not be covered by the Government scheme because it envisages a 13-week entitlement period before workers can access it. That is one example of the poor conditions faced by many educators. We know from SIPTU that 67% of early years educators report work-related stress and burnout and an overwhelming 90% say they struggle to make ends meet. This is a basic issue of women's rights and gender equality because 98% of early years professionals are women who bear the brunt of an underfunded system. We have an area representative in Ratoath, County Meath, Eilish Balfe, who has been to the fore in highlighting the crisis in the sector and who tells me there will be closures and serious shortfalls in service if things do not improve for professionals working in the service. Labour's addendum to the motion seeks to build on and strengthen the intent behind the motion, which we support. It is based on our policy and the Equal Early Years campaign that is being led by Labour women calling for a universal public childcare system and seeing this as a matter of women's equality. We know that women in Ireland spend about 20 hours more per week on care and housework than men.We also know that providing a place for every child will ease the burden significantly, particularly on women who are working outside the home. I am grateful to colleagues in the arts for telling me of how a recent survey of parents in the screen industry showed that there were particular issues with access to childcare supports for those working on freelance contracts and those working long and unsociable hours or irregular hours. This characterises the situation for people working not just in the arts, but many other sectors. Moving to a universal public system would support them. This is a matter of children's rights as well as women's rights. Inequality in Ireland starts the day a baby is born. That should not be how it is in a real republic. I have called for a Donogh O'Malley moment in respect of early years education and care. Just as the then Minister guaranteed a State-funded secondary school place for everyone 50 years ago, we need to guarantee a publicly funded preschool place for every child so as to guarantee him or her an equal start. This is the change we have been seeking with our Equal Early Years campaign – to develop a universal public system, starting with a €96 million investment in the first year targeted at the needs of parents who wish to work outside the home but cannot do so because of the prohibitive cost of childcare. We believe that the over-reliance on the for-profit market-driven model should be replaced by one that is State led and universal and relies on community childcare settings in particular. Like many of us, I have received a significant number of emails in recent days from providers – many of them very small – of childcare services and early years education outlining concerns about funding. Many of us appreciate their concerns, but we hope that they will engage with the process of reforming the system. We are all conscious that the system is not working for them as providers in many cases or for parents who are facing considerable childcare fees. Clearly, it is not working for staff and professionals in the sector either. Nor is it working for children. If we do not have an effective and adequate service and many parents cannot access places for their children, then we know the system is not working for children. I urge the House to support our amendment – our addendum, I should say – to the motion because we have so much to gain from moving to a genuinely radical reform of our early years and school age childcare services. It is right to mention the latter as an important component of any equal early years and childcare service. An enviable system is achievable. We have seen it achieved in other jurisdictions. We can have a system that guarantees flexible drop-off and collection times to reflect modern work practices and commutes. We can have a system that is based on best practice in education, play and early learning and strengthens and supports every child's development. We can support smaller private providers who face the high costs associated with running a smaller setting but who are fearful of change. We can place an emphasis on community-based, affordable care where professionals are well paid and provide the highest standard of care. We can alleviate the administrative load on services through a new funding model. All of this is possible. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to debate this matter and I ask for the House's support for our addendum, just as we will support the motion."	spk_309
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-03-31	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_32	Today we are focusing on the cost-of-living crisis and rightly so. We have seen massive and outrageous hikes in energy bills that are hitting households very hard but which are compounded by pre-existing high costs arising out of the housing crisis, where we see people having to spend a huge proportion of their income on rental and mortgage costs but also on childcare costs, which are referred to by many as a second mortgage.There are so many households with children struggling to pay for childcare. Today, I want to focus on childcare. When we describe childcare as a cost, and when parents see it as a cost, that is missing the point. This should be an investment in our future, in our society and in our children. Without the levels of public investment in childcare that we so sorely need inequality in Ireland is starting the day a child is born, which is not how it should be in a true republic. Children deserve an equal start.  The Labour Party, in particular through Labour Women, has been pushing for an equal early years campaign to ensure that children in Ireland will get an equal start and that parents will be freed from the heavy burden of paying privately for childcare, which remains so expensive and is such a huge cost for so many households. We know that in Ireland public funding for childcare remains a fraction of what is invested in other European countries. We know that UNICEF has recommended that 1% of GDP be invested in early years education and care. Although funding has increased and that is welcome, we still fall far short of that target by approximately 0.7%. For this reason, I have been calling for a Donogh O'Malley moment in early years education and care. Just as 50 years ago he, as Minister, introduced the concept of free secondary school places for every child as a right, thereby building prosperity for our country and building the investment in our children, so too should we now be seeking to implement and introduce a free childcare place, a guaranteed early years education and care place, for every child to give every child in Ireland an equal start.  Parents need to see a solution to the crisis of childcare they are facing and the State needs to do much more to address that. Most of all, children deserve that equal start. The Minister will have heard, as I do every day in our constituency of Dublin Bay South, that such is the challenge in even securing places in childcare facilities, let alone affordable places, parents are being asked to pay in advance for days they may not even avail of and they are booking childcare places long before children are born. Many who do manage to secure a place find their childcare bill exceeds what they are paying in mortgage or rent. The core funding model that is being developed - I know that is under way - will change things, but what has been committed to will simply not do enough to address rising costs and the shortage of places.  The system is failing providers and educators in childcare settings. We know from SIPTU's Big Start campaign that early years educators are demoralised, underpaid and, indeed, undervalued. Many are not paid a living wage. Does the Minister agree that we need a public childcare model in Ireland? Will the Government guarantee an early years place for every child and fair pay and conditions for staff?	spk_237

It is indeed an honour to have been elected as leader of the Labour Party. It is also a big responsibility and a challenge. I look forward to ensuring we grow the support for that strong labour voice and message that is so sorely needed. It is a strong centre-left and red-green voice that seeks to deliver progressive and positive change and a more equal society and, as part of that, to deliver on change for childcare. I note what the Minister said, but parents need to see a change urgently. We know that care work is very gendered in our society, that 98% of those working as early years professionals are women and that they remain undervalued and underpaid. We need to see urgent change on that. We also need real change to ensure parental choice. Of course it is about parental choice, but currently high fees and lack of places are forcing parents to have no choice and, as such, parents cannot, for example, return to work. We heard this morning about a woman who is struggling to find a childcare place in Dublin. She will not able to return to work because there is not an affordable childcare place available to her. Parents have no choices and children currently do not have equality.	spk_239
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-03-30	dail	33	Ceisteanna ar Reachtaíocht a Gealladh - Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_12	I welcome the news from the Government today with regard to sick pay but its proposals do not go far enough. We in the Labour Party have been calling for a more robust and effective sick pay scheme for some time now. My colleague Senator Sherlock has pointed out that the scheme proposed by the Government will not address the real needs of many of those who are in the most vulnerable categories of work. We had called for a proper effective sick pay scheme in September 2020 on foot of appeals from representatives of those working in meat plants and because we saw that employees in the childcare and early years sector were unable to access sick pay in the context of the Covid pandemic. Our concern now is that the Government's proposal does not represent a right to access sick pay from the start of employment. In particular, seasonal workers and early years educators, such as those working in the early childhood care and education scheme, ECCE, who are employed for part of the year will not be covered because the scheme envisages a 13-week period before people are entitled to access. Will the Taoiseach change the scheme to ensure it covers all workers?	spk_143
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-03-30	dail	33	Government Response to Situation in Ukraine: Statements	dbsect_13	I welcome the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Labour Party about the crisis in Ukraine and the governmental response. I want to first express my solidarity and that of my party with the people of Ukraine who have now endured an entire month of the brutal bombardment and horrific onslaught represented by the Russian invasion. Despite some indications in recent days of the scaling down of the siege on Kyiv, there is no indication that this horrendous suffering will end soon. We know just how brutal Putin's imperial regime is. I am conscious that we are standing here in this peaceful corner of Europe, while on the other side of Europe we are seeing an unthinkable atrocity being perpetrated which has unfolded within such a swift passage of time. That is one of the reasons it is so truly shocking to us. The war is a crime, and there has undoubtedly been a huge array of war crimes committed by Russian forces in the course of the war. Yesterday, I spoke in the House about having attended the funeral of Pierre Zakrzewski. We owe him, his colleague, Oleksandra Kuvshynova , who was killed alongside him in a an attack outside Kyiv, and other war reporters a great debt of gratitude for shining a spotlight on the atrocities being committed by Russia and the suffering being endured by the Ukrainian people. Without that sort of front-line reporting, we would not be as aware of the scale of the appalling devastation being endured by Ukraine. As I said, it is particularly shocking because it is happening in Europe. It is particularly shocking because of the speed with which it has unfolded and scale of the devastation that has been caused. We are witnessing the appalling siege of the people of Mariupol, as well as 4 million people having fled their own country into other EU states in the course of just over four weeks. Of course, we are also witnessing yet another manifestation of the brutal rule of Vladimir Putin. It brings to mind the sort of war Putin conducted through proxy in recent history, such as through Assad in Syria. We saw the brutal siege of Aleppo and the enormous suffering of the Syrian people under that attack. It also brings to mind other wars being conducted on other peoples who are enduring and suffering brutal bombardment. I am thinking in particular of the people of Yemen in what is sometimes referred to as a forgotten war, but which is an absolutely brutal war of which, again, civilians are bearing a significant brunt and which is being waged largely through complicity by proxy with Saudi Arabia. I was glad to stand outside the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Dublin on Saturday to protest that war and the war in Ukraine. Looking at the State's response, it is clear there has been an enormous and very welcome outpouring of generosity among all communities across Ireland. I acknowledge the speed and generosity with which the Government has responded. The Taoiseach and the Ministers, Deputies Humphreys and O'Gorman, spoke about some of the ways in which the Government has responded. I was glad to visit the Ukraine support centre nearest to me, located on Cork Street in Dublin 8, just last week and to meet officials of the Department of Social Protection and staff who had volunteered from the Citizens Information Services, the Department of Justice and other State entities. Those officials adapting so swiftly in order to assist people arriving from Ukraine is true public service. I visited volunteer-run service at the free shop on Clarendon Street, only 100 m from Leinster House, which has been set up by several volunteers to provide necessary and basic items for Ukrainian families and individuals fleeing here, some of whom I have met. I am told and know from those whom I have met that some of them have come with no more than a change of clothes. Their needs are extreme. As other Members have stated, many of them have left behind loved ones - fathers, husbands or parents - in Ukraine. The scale of human suffering is evident and it is welcome to see the great generosity with which this State has responded and the opening of our doors to 15,000 people. There are several points that we need to consider because it is clear the need is extensive and the scale of the challenge is immense. We know there have been immensely strong offers of support. The Red Cross is doing exceptionally important and impressive work in co-ordinating those offers. We know also that it may come to a situation where, as the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, stated, we will have to look at short-term housing measures. I have indicated to him and the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, that there is capacity to provide, for example, Sprung structures, as temporary accommodation on an emergency basis. My colleague Senator Moynihan has pointed out as Labour Party spokesperson on housing the need for a longer-term housing strategy and to ensure there is a revision to the Housing for All strategy and a whole-of-government response should the housing need endure for longer in the event of there being no short-term end to the war. There are concerns relating to the schooling of the many children who are coming here. It is welcome to see the way in which schools are opening their doors, as well as initiatives such as the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, taking on the provision of information in Ukrainian and Russian to families and parents to enable a smooth transition into schools here. On a recent visit to Ballyvaughan in County Clare I saw the fantastic community response, including the school response, to those coming here and fleeing such devastation. On the schooling issue, we need to ensure all the necessary supports are provided for, particularly language supports. On the issue of arrival into the country, although the Ukraine support centres and the centre at Dublin Airport have been impressive and superb, we still need to ensure there is a central point of contact and that, no matter where refugees come into the country, they receive the same level of supports. My colleague Deputy Howlin spoke last week about the concerns in Rosslare, where volunteers were doing a significant amount of work. I think that matter has been addressed but it is certainly the case that we need to ensure there are sufficient levels of support at Shannon and Cork airports and wherever else refugees are arriving. As regards employment prospects, all present, including the many Members who have met Ukrainians coming here, are very conscious that many of those coming here are highly skilled. Many of them are able to continue working if they had been working remotely in Ukraine. All of them are anxious to get work and jobs. I very much welcome the highlighting by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, of the employer mechanism but, again, supports will be required. As a trade unionist, I am concerned to ensure that nobody coming here will be exploited. We must ensure that people are protected, especially those who do not have sufficient levels of English-language skills. I commend SIPTU and other unions for committing to provide refugees with information on workers' rights and job prospects here in their own language. That is a welcome initiative. I refer to other ways in which we in Ireland can show support for Ukraine. It is clear that one such way is through our welcome of refugees here and our provision of humanitarian aid, to which the Taoiseach referred. At diplomatic level, we should be using all the non-military means at our disposal as a neutral State to support Ukraine and its accession to the EU. I am really glad the Minister, Deputy Coveney, indicated that support along with a small number of other EU states. I welcome his action in the context of the expulsion of diplomats. I very much welcomed the Taoiseach's announcement yesterday which, as it happened, was in response to my question on Leaders' Questions in respect of the expulsion of four senior officials from the Russian Embassy here. I believe we should go further and now move to expel the Russian ambassador. We did act not across the EU 27 but as one of a small number of EU states that moved to expel diplomats yesterday. I welcome that because it is an important diplomatic means at our disposal to express our condemnation of Russia's brutality in the strongest possible terms. However, we should go further now and expel the Russian ambassador. As one who has always been a member of an internationalist party, for us in the Labour Party, a member of the Party of European Socialists, it is important that we stand up against this assault on democracy and the sovereignty of a peaceful and democratic state that we are seeing unfolding before our eyes. That is why we need to take all the measures that are available to us to show our support for Ukraine and its people, as well as the Ukrainian Government and President Zelenskyy. I conclude by expressing my welcome for the fact that President Zelenskyy will address this House next week. I ask that his address be live broadcast. It is very important. Many people will want to watch the address as it comes to us. I know that many Ukrainian citizens who are now here in Ireland may like to come to the House to watch that address. If that were possible, it would be a welcome gesture. I presume the Ukrainian ambassador, H.E. Larysa Gerasko, whom I have met on several occasions, will be here, but it would be a positive gesture of solidarity with the Ukrainian people to have a strong presence in the House of the Ukrainian community and members of that community here in Ireland. I again ask that we use all means at our disposal to convey our strong condemnation of Russia and our strong solidarity with the people of Ukraine as they endure this horrific onslaught.	spk_217
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-03-30	dail	33	Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_14	"I welcome the opportunity to debate the Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill, which Labour is glad to support. As the Minister of State said, the Bill aims to shift Ireland's consumption patterns from a take-make-waste linear model to the more sustainable pattern of production and consumption with the aim of reducing and minimising waste and thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It is a very welcome move. In a circular economy, as we know, waste and resource use are minimised and the use and value of products and materials are maintained for as long as possible so that when a product reaches the end of its life, its parts are used again and again to create further useful and productive products instead of being discarded, an all-too familiar pattern which we have been hearing about. It is hard for many of us to fathom the quantity of waste that is produced worldwide. Most of us probably do not like to think about waste. Naturally it is distasteful even to reflect on the amount of waste we in our own households produce - the non-productive producing of waste. It is hard to visualise it; it is not something we like to think about or talk about. It is out of sight and out of mind in many cases. However, clearly we need to address this issue of waste. It was brought to my attention very graphically on a recent visit I made to the Covanta waste incineration plant in my constituency in the Poolbeg Peninsula. I was confronted with literally a mountain of human-produced waste, mostly domestic but also corporate. That was a wake-up call. It has quite a profound effect to be confronted with the visible manifestation of our waste and our wasteful habits. I very much welcome the Bill because it seeks to tackle that issue which we all-too often do not like to think about, talk about or even debate in political circles. I want to speak about different aspects of the Bill that I welcome. On the use of CCTV, in respect of section 20 of the Bill I welcome the introduction of measures to detect and deter illegal dumping and littering by empowering local authorities to use GDPR-compliant technologies to detect and prevent unsightly and illegal dumping and littering among other measures. We in Labour support this measure first proposed by my colleague Senator Mark Wall in the Seanad, through the Local Government (Use of CCTV in Prosecution of Offences) Bill 2021 which he introduced last year with a view to addressing the difficulty local authorities have in addressing illegal dumping. I should say that years ago, as a practitioner in criminal defence in the District Courts, it was always quite a memorable experience to hear the local litter wardens bringing their prosecutions and giving evidence to the court of how they had to go through bags to pick out envelopes and other materials that could identify the relevant offenders so that they could bring forward the prosecutions. It is a very cumbersome and very difficult task to prosecute in these cases. I welcome the initiative that has been taken here. It is something that has been brought to our minds more because of the pandemic-related restrictions. The travel restrictions imposed over the last couple of years have meant that many people who might have exercised in gyms or leisure centres were instead exercising outdoors locally. It really brought home to many of us the realisation that so much environmental vandalism is caused by fly tippers and litterers in urban and rural settings alike. In some areas illegal dumping has caused really serious erosion and other problems. It can be found everywhere not just in remote rural areas but in the main streets of our cities and throughout our constituencies. Cleaning up the mess comes at a cost. It is not only creating an unsightly but in some cases hazardous environment. Senator Wall has given me the estimate that across 31 local authorities in the State, the cost of clearing up litter and illegally dumped materials may be as much as €90 million per year which is enormous. This is without considering the enormous voluntary effort put in by community clean-up groups which operate nationwide. I go out with my own group, the Friends of the Grand Canal, on the first Saturday every month. I know there are also local voluntary clean-up groups across my constituency in Portobello, Kimmage, Donnybrook, Terenure, Rathgar, Sandymount, Ringsend and Irishtown. These are volunteers who go out every week and do tremendous work, keeping their areas clean. Dublin City Council and the local authorities generally, of course, also do a great deal of work. A number of constituents in my area have been very concerned at the removal of public bins in heavy footfall areas such as beside Charlemont Luas stop thereby contributing to a resurgence of illegal dumping and littering. We need to ensure the adequate supply of litter bins and that the councils are engaging in regular collection. We also need to support local community groups like the ones I have mentioned, which have taken such an interest in and put in such an effort to keep local areas clean. We are very lucky that there is such a voluntary effort going into clean-ups across the country. It shows the need to address illegal dumping and littering, which is a serious issue. The aspect of the Bill that has received most focus is the reduction in single-use items at sections 11 to 14, inclusive. There has been some good collaboration on waste measures in the past between Labour and the Green Party. During the last Dáil, there was a joint venture between my colleague Deputy Sherlock and the now MEP Grace O'Sullivan with whom I worked in the Seanad. Deputy Sherlock and Grace O'Sullivan MEP worked together on the Bill to prohibit certain products containing plastic microbeads. That was another important measure brought forward to address single-use items, in particular plastic, and the enormous challenge plastic waste constitutes. Following extensive debate and engagement with the previous Government that Government agreed to pass its own legislation to ban the manufacture or placing on the market of any water-soluble personal care cleaning product containing microplastics or microbeads. The engagement leading to the passage of that legislation represents the sort of red-green or green-red politics that I believe in. It is also a collaborative and constructive approach to politics, understanding the connectedness of the climate and biodiversity crises and indeed the crisis and challenges in dealing with waste. I ask the Minister of State to engage with his colleague at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to advance further regulatory measures dealing with plastic waste in particular, both at domestic and EU level because we are all conscious of the significant amount of microplastic material detected specifically in marine life. The logical natural progression of banning these toxic microplastics is that we would now seek to phase out single-use plastics altogether. The Minister of State referred to the levy that was imposed on plastic bags which was controversial when it was first introduced. Because it has now become so embedded in our national culture, we often forget that the topic actually dominated phone-in talk-radio shows for weeks at the time it was sought to be introduced, as indeed did the introduction of smoke-free areas and so on. We then adjust and move on, recognising the enormous benefit to us all, our society and our country that these measures represent. Now that society has adjusted to the plastic bag levy, we all bring our own shopping bags to supermarkets without even thinking twice. Similarly, we need to move to a situation where we regard it as natural that we have phased out single-use plastic. I listened to the coverage of the Bill on ""Morning Ireland"" this morning. Those interviewed in vox pops were shocked to learn that about 200 million disposable coffee cups are sent to landfill or incineration every year.Again reflecting on my experience of visiting the Covanta site, we saw a huge amount of single-use coffee cups in that mountain of waste sent to be incinerated and a huge volume of other recyclable materials. While we have had very strong uptake of recycling and very positive figures on increased use of recycling and of green bins, there is still too much recyclable material going into incineration, which is something we need to address. It is, of course, positive to see the move away from landfill, which the Minister of State addressed, and I have certainly seen those impressive statistics. However, we need to do more to develop the potential in the waste to energy sector, for example, through the rolling out of district heating systems, which, again, in my own area have been promised for a long time for Ringsend. I see the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, looking somewhat rueful about this. It is an issue on which there has been far too much delay. We need to see this moved on as a matter of urgency. Other European countries have well established waste to energy programmes. District heating is the obvious use of waste to energy. It an obvious application where waste to energy can really make a huge difference and can really improve people's quality of life and address issues around the very concerning rises in fuel and energy costs. It is very positive, therefore, to see these measures brought into the Bill around single-use items, disposable coffee cups in particular, on which there has been a real focus. To be very local for a moment, it is very welcome to see signs up in the canteen in Leinster House suggesting people use their own cup rather than taking a disposable one to the coffee machine. We have a responsibility to lead by example. I never miss the opportunity to say that one area where we have really failed to lead by example here in Leinster House is on encouragement of cycling. As the co-convenor with Senator Garvey of the Oireachtas cyclists group, we have been pushing for many years to try to get decent bike parking facilities in Leinster House. It is something I will again be in contact with the Minister of State about because we need to be seen to encourage more Oireachtas Members and staff to cycle to work. We are not sending out a signal that we are a welcoming space for cyclists with the very poor provision of bike parking facilities and with absolutely no covered bike parking facilities, while cars are parked everywhere, often on the lawn at the back of Leinster House. This is where we need to be leading by example, as we are on encouraging the use of keep cups or people's own cups. I want to move to another point on which this Bill could do more or where we may need to see additional legislation, and that is on the right to repair. While this Bill, in a very welcome way, will assist in shifting behaviour among producers and the general population, we also need to do more to shift the balance of power from manufacturers and corporations back to citizens and ordinary people. It is often difficult to make sustainable choices. We heard Deputy Martin Kenny speak about the difficulties with repairing products that break down and the fact that, in too many cases, those products are simply disposed of and new products are purchased. This relatively new concept of a right to repair is one we need to see enshrined in law. It would make a huge difference in reducing waste while also addressing a power imbalance between consumers and manufacturers, and putting more money in people’s pockets. In March 2020, the European Commission adopted its new circular economy action plan, which aims to establish a strong and coherent product policy framework to transform European consumption patterns and to avoid the production of waste in the first place. As part of this process, the Commission looks to embed a right to repair in EU consumer and product policies. This sort of legislation was strongly recommended, I note, by several of the submissions to the public consultation underpinning this Bill. It is an important part of a circular economy plan. The idea of right to repair was also echoed in debates which have taken place in the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action over recent months. This Bill could do more on the issue. I have already drafted a Labour Party Bill to enshrine a right to repair. I should say it was inspired by the writing of Karlin Lillington in  I am conscious that, as is the case with many of us, my area of Dublin 8 has a number of small local phone shops where people can bring their smartphone or whatever make of mobile phone they have if the screen has cracked – in a household with teenagers, there are often many incidents of phone screens being cracked. The small local shop will fix the phone screen, usually in a matter of minutes, but, of course, if that is done, it generally means the phone is no longer guaranteed by the manufacturer because the manufacturer has retained the monopoly of repair. That is exactly the sort of practice which right to repair legislation seeks to tackle. I believe it should be an important component of any circular economy legislation to enshrine that right to repair, to re-empower consumers and to break that cycle of obsolescence which generates so much waste and which will continue to do so unless we tackle it. We must go beyond the current EU directives and EU measures and extend that right to include not just digital electronic equipment, albeit that is a very important area, but also to include smaller household devices and to empower consumers generally. In the spirit of our previous engagement with the Government on the CCTV issue and on the prohibition of microbeads, I would hope the Minister of State will work with me and my party colleagues to see this principle placed on a legislative footing. More generally, we very much welcome the concept of a circular economy. We in the Labour Party have put forward the important concept that national economic planning and climate targets must be in sync because they are two sides of the same coin. We need to ensure that any economic strategy takes account of and builds in environmental strategy and regional job generation to ensure we become the renewable superpower that we can be, and to break the hold of fossil fuel oligarchs and magnates, which I know is very much in all of our minds at present. It would also, of course, ensure that climate would be at the heart of government. While the Green Party clearly has a very strong commitment on climate action, the offices of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform are held by the other two Government parties, so we need to see that cross-party and cross-government strategising on the economy and on the environment together. I want to mention Part 5 of the Bill, which is very important. It will end the issuing of new licences for exploration and mining of coal, lignite and oil shale, a welcome and important component of the move to consolidate a policy of reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Again, this is a topic that many of us have been speaking about. I expressed yesterday to the Taoiseach my wish that we need to take every step to avoid the horrific war in Ukraine having consequences on climate targets and environmental action. However, it may well do, because we are certainly seeing this horrific war, this brutal invasion of Ukraine, having enormous knock-on effects on food security, fuel and energy security and the cost of living for all of us, not just in Ireland but across the world and, in particular, in developing countries that were so reliant on Ukrainian wheat imports as much as anything. We know the war has already had enormous consequences. It may pose a threat to the limited but hard-fought for gains achieved at COP26 last year and it may pose obstacles to the reaching of our own climate targets. However, we also know that the consequences of failing to keep global temperatures below 1.5°C this century will be catastrophic and that any further slippage could have unthinkable results for humanity as we face this existential crisis. All of us are conscious of our fortune in being able to stand here in a peaceful corner of Europe to debate climate issues as the war rages in Ukraine and as people in Mariupol, Kyiv and elsewhere endure horrific bombardment but, undoubtedly, the climate crisis is that existential crisis that confronts us all and that we need to take more urgent action on. I very much welcome the Bill. I would like to see more on the right to repair and I hope to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage on that topic."	spk_265

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-03-29	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I will take up that offer. Gabhaim buíochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I appreciate that. I also welcome the Taoiseach back. Fáilte ar ais. I pay tribute to my colleague and the outgoing leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Kelly, for his immense work, commitment and contribution to the party, to the House and to public debate over many years. My solidarity and that of the Labour Party is with the people of Ukraine, who for the past month have been enduring the horrific war crimes and the brutal Russian invasion and bombardment. I have just come from the funeral of Pierre Zakrzewski. I was honoured to receive an invitation to attend from Michelle and his family. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, was also there. I pay tribute to the immense bravery of Mr. Zakrzewski and that of his colleagues, war reporters and journalists, who have brought us news of the atrocities and shone a spotlight on the war crimes being committed daily in Ukraine by Russia and Putin's brutal regime. There is a moral and political imperative on us to do more to support the people of Ukraine through all the peaceful and humanitarian means at our disposal.We have supported Ukraine's application for accession to the EU, which is very welcome, and we have moved with a number of EU states on that. We have opened our doors to refugees fleeing Ukraine and I pay tribute to the many people across Ireland welcoming refugees and doing so much to support refugees coming here. I call again for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador from Ireland. If EU member states do not act in concert in such action, as would be ideal, we should move to do it unilaterally. The time has come when we see the horrors of Mariupol and the horrors being rained down on the people of Ukraine. It is now incumbent on us to do this. Remaining conscious of the carnage and loss of life in Ukraine, I believe the Government should be doing more to support people through the fallout of the war in Ukraine, which has compounded the three crises facing people across the country today. There is a crisis in the cost of living, with rising inflation; a crisis in fuel and energy security and supply; and, of course, the existential climate emergency or crisis. The effects of the terrible war in Ukraine are, among other things, posing a threat to the limited but nonetheless welcome gains we saw at an international level in reducing emissions at COP26 and our own welcome ambitious targets in the climate action Act. We know European countries are seeking ways to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas and I have called for Ireland at an EU level to do more to push for a full embargo on Russian oil and gas. In order to do that, we must ensure we do not look to other fossil fuels in that period as that is not the approach we should be taking. For example, there are reports that nine liquefied natural gas terminals are due to be constructed on this island, with eight in this jurisdiction, over the coming years, and that is concerning. It would be concerning to see us locking ourselves into that when instead we should be looking at ramping up our renewables and our capacity in renewables. We are seeing concerns being expressed by Wind Energy Ireland and others about how we can achieve those targets. What is the Government doing on a process to expel the Russian ambassador? What is the Government doing to ensure we can have energy security without further reliance on fossil fuels?	spk_43

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-03-29	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I thank the Taoiseach for his kind words. I also appreciate his comments about the importance of war reporting. I absolutely agree with him that this is an attack on democracy. It is a brutal and unprovoked attack on a peaceful sovereign state. We have to be absolutely clear in our condemnation of Russian action and our solidarity with Ukraine. It is in that spirit that I offer constructively my view that we should be doing more as a neutral country through non-military means to express that condemnation. Just as we have seen Ireland moving along with other nations to support Ukraine's application for accession to the EU, so too should we be moving with like-minded nations, even if we do not have full agreement across the EU, on more stringent diplomatic measures such as expulsions of diplomats. I think that is one way, along with the other things we are doing, that we as a neutral State can show our outright condemnation. On the issue of climate, I ask the Taoiseach again about how the construction of new gas-fired plants is compatible with meeting our targets on renewables, particularly as there are already so many concerns about whether we can, in fact, meet those targets with offshore wind development.	spk_49

It includes 14 stories, which are pen pictures of the lived experiences of children in the north-east inner city communities, showing the need for investment in early years, after-school care and youth work as a critical part of addressing the needs particularly of children and families.

Last 26 November was the 60th anniversary of the international withdrawal of thalidomide, but this State has failed to offer any acknowledgement of the circumstances in which the drug was not withdrawn in Ireland at that point and continued to be prescribed after that date, with consequent harm caused to children. Having met with many members of the Irish Thalidomide Association, I am conscious of how anxious they are that their parents, many of whom are now very elderly, would receive a formal acknowledgement from the State as a matter of urgency. I have sought support from colleagues of all parties and Independent groupings for a cross-party motion expressing our co-ordinated and collegiate response as a parliamentary House to the concerns of thalidomide survivors.

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-03-23	dail	33	Ban on Sex for Rent Bill 2022: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_8	"I commend Deputies Cian O'Callaghan and Whitmore and their colleagues on bringing forward this important Bill. The Labour Party offers its strong support for it. All of our thoughts at this time are with the people of Ukraine, who are enduring the horrific bombardment of the brutal Russian invasion. Other speakers have pointed out that this Bill has an application for the many people fleeing to our shores seeking refuge and who may be at risk of exploitation by unscrupulous landlords. We all are very conscious of that. I am very glad the Government is supporting the Bill but I echo the calls of colleagues for a clear timeline for its introduction into law. The Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, in particular, has expressed strong support for it, which is why the Cabinet has agreed to approve it in principle. That is very important. We all want to condemn the appalling practice that has been described and which the Bill aims to criminalise. Its provisions would create two offences. The first is the offence of a person accepting or requiring sex for the purpose of access to, or retention of, accommodation and related services. The second offence is that of facilitating the offence of accepting or requiring sex as a condition of accommodation, which is notably aimed at publishers. Both are indictable offences carrying significant penalties. I may comment further on these proposed offences presently. Before that, I want to speak a little about the context of these proposals. We know from the experience in Britain that this practice, appallingly, is relatively widespread. UK research by Shelter found that between 30,000 and 40,000 people were targeted by current or prospective landlords over a three-month period. We do not have that level of data for this country and it would be important to know how widespread this appalling practice is here. We are absolutely indebted to Ann Murphy and the  It also illustrates one of the causes of this appalling practice, which is the power imbalance in Ireland currently whereby there is so little accommodation for those seeking to rent and landlords, therefore, are in such a position of power relative to tenants. There always is a power imbalance in this regard but notably so during a housing crisis. We are aware that this is a problem throughout the country.We know from data how few properties are available for rental. It is one of the reasons the Labour Party brought forward a renters' rights Bill drafted by my colleague, Senator Moynihan, to seek to try to strengthen renters' rights and ensure that landlords had more responsibilities. We also need to see an increase in supply of housing and the building of housing on public land. That is crucial to address the housing crisis. We are all well aware of that. I will speak about the provisions in the Bill and about existing law. The Minister of State identified some drafting issues in his speech and the need for the tightening up of language but these issues could be dealt with through collaboration with the Bill's proposers on Committee and Report Stages. Similarly, the issue of compatibility with existing criminal law could be addressed. There is a need to ensure we have a clearly streamlined series of laws on sex offences, rather than piecemeal amendments being carried out. In terms of civil law penalties, a sex-for-rent arrangement, under housing law, would clearly be in breach of quiet enjoyment and exclusive possession. However, there is a gap because such covenants are only read into tenancy agreements and not into room-for-rent or room-sharing arrangements. That is clearly a gap. Of course, the remedies for breach of tenancy covenants are civil only and there is no criminal offence committed by a breach. Deputy Ó Broin made a good point about the need to ensure the Residential Tenancies Board would be able to take action against unscrupulous landlords who engage in this practice. That is another matter that might be addressed through separate legislation. As others have said, Part 4 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 criminalises the purchase of sexual services and brings Nordic-model laws into Ireland in keeping with a unanimous report by the then Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. The report was supported by all parties and had the widespread support of the trade union movement, NGOs, the National Women's Council, the Immigrant Council of Ireland and others. A major campaign resulted in the passage of that important legislation, which has been very effective in other countries in which it has been introduced to tackle to demand for sexual services and reduce the incidence of prostitution. That law was introduced precisely to deal with this issue of exploitation and abuse of power and to recognise that women from migrant and disadvantaged backgrounds, in particular, are very much at risk of exploitation and abuse and that a law tackling demands by criminalising the purchase of sex is an effective means to deal with that exploitation. That law is in place but it does not cover the situation of a person who seeks sex in return for renting a property. It tackles those who are engaged in the sex trade and prostitution and exploited through prostitution. There is, therefore, a gap and the purchase of sexual services ban would not cover the practice addressed here. Other potentially applicable offences under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 would not necessarily cover this either. The very progressive updated definition of consent for which we fought very hard to have included in section 48 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 provides that consent must be ""freely and voluntarily"" given but it does not address the situation where consent is lacking by reason of situation of exploitation of power or economic dominance. There is a gap and that is why this legislation is important. The second offence of arranging or facilitating, as the Minister of State has said, may well be covered under section 7 of the Criminal Law Act 1997. However, there is a strong case to be made for explicitly prohibiting advertising of this sort. We have some precedent for that in section 23 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994. I will finish by referring to the context by which we have a need for this legislation. As the tragic murder of Ashling Murphy reminded us, unfortunately and regrettably, women are still especially vulnerable to harassment, abuse, intimidation and exploitation. The practice of sexual exploitation of women and vulnerable persons is not new. We know it is compounded by class and immigration status and that women from migrant backgrounds are especially vulnerable to sexual exploitation in Ireland today, where we see large numbers of migrant women exploited through the sex trade on a daily basis. It is very important that we recognise that power imbalance and the coercive context in which practices such as that identified in this legislation are carried out. I will refer to the appalling situation in Ukraine and pay tribute to international and national NGOs such as the sexual exploitation research programme, SERP, in UCD, which has identified very strong risks of women and girls being vulnerable to sexual exploitation and trafficking where they are moving in such large numbers to flee from the Russian bombardment. We know there have been instances of that at the borders of Ukraine and that there is a risk it will happen here. Indeed, there have been some suggestions that it is already happening. That is all the more reason to ensure this legislation is brought through the process speedily and that we see a clear timeframe for its adoption."	spk_34
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-03-09	dail	33	Flexible and Remote Work: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_10	I commend my colleagues, Deputies Nash and Duncan Smith, on proposing this important motion. I am proud to speak in support of it. I also pay tribute to our colleague, Senator Sherlock, who has done so much to enshrine a right to flexible working in law. I acknowledge how fortunate we all are to be able to stand here in a peaceful parliament debating this issue while bombs are raining down on the people of Ukraine. We stand in solidarity with them at their darkest hour. As Deputy Howlin says, Covid has changed the nature of work for all of us in Ireland and we have seen a new way of working emerge. Pre-pandemic, many of us took for granted a form of work that emphasised presenteeism: the jacket on the back of the chair and the fact that people were expected to be in the office at all hours. That was accompanied by the awful daily ritual of the lengthy early-morning commute for so many, which was unpaid and was time taken out of people's lives and family time. The pandemic has offered us a great opportunity to reset priorities, to enshrine in law the right to flexible working that will benefit all of us: men and women, individuals, families and local communities. I wish to emphasise the importance that a genuine right to flexible work would have for women.Speaking on the morning after International Women's Day, we can all acknowledge that women, in particular, will stand to gain from a genuine right to flexible work. The Central Bank has noted that women's participation in the Irish labour force has increased by 3.5 percentage points since the pandemic began. While it is true to say that during the pandemic many women continued to bear the lion's share of caring responsibilities and unpaid domestic responsibilities in the home, it is also the case that the opportunity to engage in hybrid working or remote working enabled more women to participate in the workforce. Indeed, enabling men to work from home also enabled men to take up more responsibilities as fathers and as carers. This could have great feminist benefits too, not just for women but also for men. We are all conscious of the benefit for the environment that a genuine right to flexible work can afford us. We saw a reduction in carbon emissions during the lockdowns. Many of us in Dublin city constituencies heard for the first time the clarity of birdsong on the street. While climate action of course requires a deal more than a right to remote working, genuinely more people being enabled to work from home will mean less traffic, fewer polluting cars on our roads and better air quality for all of us. At a time of serious concerns about energy security, it will also reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.  As Deputy Duncan Smith has outlined, the growth of local communities was greatly strengthened and enabled during Covid-19. Quality of life improved for many people who were able to move out of city centre locations and work from home in areas where perhaps they were closer to family and to their original local communities. All of these benefits are clear from a genuine right to remote work, as we are proposing in this motion and in our legislation that Senator Sherlock has drafted. Unfortunately, the Government's Bill, rather than providing for a right to request remote work, is more effectively a right to refuse for employers. As Deputy Nash has said, it is a toothless and anaemic Bill. The right to refuse effectively undermines and countermands that right to request which it is apparently supposed to provide. The Government has failed to include within the draft Bill a presumption that if work has been done remotely during the pandemic, it is reasonably practical to expect it to continue to be done remotely or at least to give employees and workers the option to work remotely and to work in a hybrid fashion. We know that the majority of people in Ireland wish to see this right to remote work and a more hybrid model of work enshrined into law and embedded in our policy going into the future. It should not just be seen as something that was unique to the pandemic. It should be seen as something that we can provide for permanently. The Labour Party has a long record in working for workers' rights. Our working from home Bill in 2020 would have given workers a statutory right to switch off. That again must be taken along with the right to remote working. We have also pushed for a Donogh O'Malley moment in childcare to ensure a universal public scheme of childcare. That too must accompany a genuine package of measures to enable more women to take part in the workforce and in public life, and to enable all workers to have a better quality of life. This will benefit all of us: workers, families and communities. I urge the Minister of State to accept the motion.	spk_41
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-03-08	dail	33	International Women's Day: Statements	dbsect_15	"As we debate and celebrate International Women's Day in this peaceful corner of Europe, we all think of the women and children fleeing the brutal bombardment from Russian forces in Ukraine, and we think of all those in Ukraine suffering and enduring under the horrific invasion that is unfolding before us.We are entering the second week of it and we stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and in condemnation of Russian aggression. As we celebrate International Women's Day here at home, we can reflect on our many achievements. In 2018, I was proud to chair the Vótáil 100 programme celebrating the centenary of women's suffrage in Ireland. In the 100 years since Constance Markievicz was elected as the first woman Teachta Dála, we have undoubtedly come a long way. We saw the repeal of the eighth amendment in 2018 and a real groundswell of support for feminist principles. There is, however, so much more to do. I am glad to be playing a part, on a cross-party basis, in seeking to bring about further change in my role as Vice Chair of the women's caucus, ably led by Senator O'Loughlin, and as the Chair of the new Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality, with Senator Pauline O'Reilly as the wonderful Vice Chair. We are seeking to make progress on equality for women and on equality for all. Gender equality cuts both ways and must look at how gendered inequalities affect men and women. I commend Dr. Catherine Day and the citizens' assembly which produced for us 45 clear and concise recommendations, what I have called a blueprint for gender equality. Those recommendations set out substantive policy changes that must be made to ensure a more equal Ireland. They address a range of issues, including gender-based violence, stereotypes in education, leadership, politics and the workplace, childcare, and care more generally. We commenced our public hearings with Catherine Day last week. We will be holding another public hearing this Thursday, when our cross-party committee will be looking at constitutional change. I hope that one of the first tangible outcomes of our committee, which will be reporting in December, will be a referendum to be held early in 2023 to remove the sexist and outdated language about women and mothers from our Constitution. There is no longer any excuse for having retained this gendered language in 2022, which refers to mothers as having ""duties in the home"" but that gives no recognition to fathers, which means it is also sexist in its view of men. I also want us to act, as the citizens' assembly has required, to extend the gender quota in politics to provide for clear gender quotas in politics but also across public life and concerning companies and boards as well. We heard today at an International Parliamentary Union, IPU, event that I addressed how poorly Ireland is doing in respect of women in politics. We all know that, when we look around this Chamber, less than one quarter of Deputies are women. My election last summer brought us up to the dizzy height of women constituting 23% of the House, meaning more than three quarters of our Deputies are men. Yet this is the highest proportion of women Deputies we have ever had. Therefore, we must do more with positive action measures to address this situation. I welcome today's announcement by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, regarding gender pay gap reporting. It is very welcome, albeit long overdue. Some years ago, I introduced a gender pay gap Bill in the Seanad that would have had a broader application to a wider range of companies and employers. It also provided for stronger sanctions and an enforcement mechanism through the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC. I am, however, glad to have seen this Bill at last being introduced. It will be revealing to see the required statements setting out employers' understanding of the reasons for the gender pay gap, as well as what they propose to do to address it. I refer to the action plan, which has been seen as being so crucial in other countries. This is a welcome measure and something the citizens' assembly recommended we introduce. Clearly, however, this is not enough to tackle gender inequality in the workplace. What we must see, essentially, is far greater recognition and acknowledgement of women's disproportionate share of caring responsibilities. The citizens' assembly has again given us a blueprint for change regarding care, particularly for childcare, but also concerning elder care and support for carers more generally. The citizens' assembly has also called for a radical change to our childcare provision to ensure we have a publicly funded childcare system, which I have called for in terms of a Donogh O'Malley moment in childcare provision. I refer to a situation where every preschool child has a guarantee of a place. In my constituency of Dublin Bay South, and in every constituency in Ireland, parents are faced with greatly concerning increases in fees for childcare spaces and a real challenge in even obtaining childcare for their children. We must move away from that situation and ensure all children have a right to a place in childcare. My party, the Labour Party, has a proud history of fighting not just for the rights of workers but specifically for women at work and for women across society. Some of our achievements include the introduction of the Equality Acts and the creation of the Low Pay Commission. We have also seen the great impacts of campaigns led by Labour Party women such as equal early years in the context of ensuring publicly funded childcare as well as on issues such as abortion rights, access to contraception and much more. On International Women's Day, I restate our commitment to continuing that campaign for equality to address all facets of gender inequality and sexism in society and ensure we break the bias in this regard, as the theme for this year requires. Turning for a moment to the intersection of women's rights and climate action, this is also a crucial aspect as we face this climate catastrophe. The awful conflict in Ukraine is compounding energy and security issues and causing all sorts of other pressures too. These issues will impact more on women than on men. Women labouring in the textile industry, for example, work in dangerous conditions for poverty wages so that fast fashion companies can market discount clothes to women, girls and everyone in this country. These are the sorts of interconnected issues we must address. We must see the speedy introduction of mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence requirements at EU level and here. We must act in respect of women's labour rights, recognise the gendered impact of the climate crisis, as UN Women has noted, and ensure this year's other theme for International Women's Day, gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow, amounts to a rousing call to action for all of us, women and men alike."	spk_221
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-03-02	dail	33	Institutional Burials Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_18	"As we debate this Bill, the people of Ukraine are suffering the brutal invasion and bombardment by Russian forces. We are seeing the deaths of children and civilians. That makes us all reflect on the importance and privilege of being able to debate legislation in a debating chamber in a parliament in a peaceful democratic republic. We must all reassert the true value of democracy. The war in Ukraine reminds us all not to take that for granted. I wanted to preface my remarks with that. I know that feeling is shared across the House. I did not get to speak in the debate on Ukraine last night but I will be speaking later in the debate on Palestine with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and will express that view again. My colleague, Deputy Howlin, spoke passionately in support of, and in solidarity with, the people of Ukraine in the debate last night, as did many others in a genuinely cross-party manner. I acknowledge that. I welcome the opportunity to speak for the Labour Party on this important Bill and to express our support for it. I express the sincere sympathies of the Labour Party and my colleagues to the survivors of Tuam and other mother and baby homes, and their families. I also pay tribute to the tireless work of Ms Catherine Corless who did so much to uncover the fact and true extent of the burials at Tuam. Her work has been crucial to the development of our knowledge on this issue. Like other speakers, I have had immense levels of correspondence from constituents and survivors, who have been so courageous as to get in touch with us to share their personal stories and those of their families. I thank them for this because it really does enrich our knowledge and understanding as legislators when we come to look at Bills in this area. We legislators must, therefore, do right by survivors by ensuring the swift passage of legislation to address the outstanding issues that remain following the scandalous treatment of women and children in mother and baby homes throughout the 20th century, until as recently as the late 1990s. I recognise the Minister's commitment to bringing this legislation forward swiftly. I also acknowledge the immense work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, led by Deputy Funchion. I have been fortunate to work with her and colleagues on the committee in recent months. Indeed, we are engaging later this evening on amendments to the Birth Information and Tracing Bill. A great deal of work has been done by committee members, including Deputy Cairns and others, on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill before us today. I thank my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Sherlock, who was our representative on the committee for that process. I acknowledge that the Minister, as he said, has made changes to the Bill in the light of some of the recommendations made by the committee. That is very important and welcome. The purpose of the Bill is to provide a legal basis to enable some closure, finally, for survivors and the families of the children and babies who are buried at Tuam. Much of the Bill is technical, the aim being to create the statutory framework to enable exhumation and excavation to take place. The need for legislation was made clear upon publication of the report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related matters. On Tuam, we might reflect that the commission found there were 978 child deaths, 80% of them of children under a year old and 67% involving infants aged between one and six months. These are horrendous figures. We know the worst years were 1943 to 1947, when many of those deaths took place. It is very difficult to fathom the scale of what happened when we read the figures in the report but it becomes clearer when we think of each of those human stories and the impact on the mothers and families. When the report was published, there was unity in this House in calling for its recommendations to be given effect as quickly as possible. I am conscious that many of those who have contacted us are older persons who are worried they may not be alive to see the culmination of the legislative process. It is important that we deal swiftly not only with this Bill but also the Birth Information and Tracing Bill, which, as I said, we are debating in committee later, and with establishing the new redress scheme. I look forward to working constructively with the Minister and on a cross-party basis to ensure this key package of legislative measures is brought into place as swiftly as possible, albeit that we need to ensure the proposals are given adequate legislative scrutiny. I welcome the Minister's response to the report of the children's committee and the changes made as a result, including the removal of restrictions on the jurisdiction of the coroner and the alignment of the forensic investigative process with international standards. There are still some concerns being expressed to us by survivors that the language of the Bill may mean there are unnecessary limits placed on the coroner. It would be good to hear more about how that is being addressed in the Bill. Another positive development is the expansion of the survivor engagement provisions. I very much welcome the expansion of family participation in DNA identification in particular. We need to ensure such engagement is not just expanded through legislative provision but also through the processes that are put in place. The Minister has spoken about the public information campaign, which is very welcome, but we need more detail about it and about mechanisms for the involvement and engagement of survivors and families. As we all would acknowledge, there have been some unfortunate breaches of trust with survivors, such as the manner in which details of the commission's report were leaked, for example, and the initial inadequacy of communications with survivors who did not or do not have access to IT. There also were issues around misrepresentations of testimony in the report. All of these issues can and should be addressed. The public information campaign is a very welcome measure in the Bill because it will provide a better framework for consultation and involvement of stakeholders and survivors. We know a large number of people are affected by the issues dealt with in the Bill. A total of 56,000 mothers and 57,000 children passed through the mother and baby homes under investigation by the commission. Thousands more were resident in other institutions outside its terms of reference. We have spoken before in this Chamber about the shocking mortality rate for babies, not just at Tuam but also in the other institutions. It is shocking indeed that one in seven, or 15%, of babies, numbering 9,000, died before their first birthday in the homes covered by the report. Within the confidential committee section of the report, we learned of the true extent of abuse suffered by survivors, the widespread practice of forced labour and the extensive practice of coerced or forced adoption. We will be debating some of those issues at the committee this evening. In this regard, I note the powerful contribution of Carmel Cantwell, who spoke to Brian O'Connell on the ""Today with Claire Byrne"" show yesterday about her experience. They discussed a map dating from the early 1950s that labelled a site in the Bessborough home as a children's burial site. That is worth mentioning because this Bill, as the Minister said, has import beyond Tuam, albeit the latter is the main focus. We are all very conscious of some of the revelations about Bessborough as well. This map labelled a particular site as a burial site but, listening to those who appeared on the show, it appears there was no physical or documentary evidence of burials at the site. This sort of discrepancy is very upsetting and concerning for families, who naturally will wonder what it means when there is a burial site marked on a map. It is the sort of issue that was taken up so powerfully by Catherine Corless. In her appearance on the programme, Ms Cantwell spoke about her brother, William, who died and was labelled as an unclaimed baby, despite this not reflecting the reality of their experience. This very powerful interview gave a name to, and identifying details about, just one of the babies who apparently died at Bessborough. As I said, when we look at figures, we can sometimes forget the individual, human stories behind them. On the survivor engagement point, we are hearing from survivors and those affected, such as Ms Cantwell, that the voices of the mothers who went through the homes must be at the forefront and that all facets of the State response must be survivor-led. Is it possible to broaden the parameters of qualifying family members in the legislation to ensure they are as inclusive as possible, in recognition of the complexities of families, particularly in the context of how much time has elapsed since many of these deaths took place? I am conscious that we are all being contacted not only by people who were residents in homes but also those who may be cousins of babies buried there, for instance, or who know, through family folklore or history, that this happened. They should be brought within the scope of the legislation. It is sensible that the Bill reflects the period examined by the commission but we are all conscious that there are concerns remaining about the exclusion of some survivors from the proposed redress scheme because they were incarcerated in institutions outside the remit of the commission institutions, such as Temple Hill, Westbank, St. Anne's, Cork, Mount St. Joseph's and others. We also know there are issues around qualifying criteria in the redress scheme, which we will debate in due course when the legislation is brought forward Again, I ask the Minister to consider broadening the scope of persons covered by that legislation. Indeed, I wrote to him last month to ask that he revisit the matter. I am very glad to hear this Bill will not prevent future inquests or investigations into deaths at Tuam. While it is important that the primary focus of the Bill should be to give closure to families and reunite them, it is also important that we are careful not to repeat mistakes of the past, whereby survivors and families have felt re-traumatised when legislation has had the consequence of preventing them from seeking further justice or speaking out about the awful abuse they faced. I have in mind the residential institutions redress scheme, for instance, where that sort of gagging clause became very contentious and difficult for many survivors. There are a number of other concerns about the legislation, which we may address further on Committee Stage. Advocates have lamented the retention of the controversial provision empowering Ministers unilaterally to decide whether a site is to be exhumed and investigated or if it will be subject solely to a process of memorialisation. There are differing views among families and survivors about different sites and which is the most appropriate process. The key issue is to ensure adequate communication with the families affected to avoid further distress to the many people who may be seeking different outcomes from legislative interventions on these sites. I would like to hear from the Minister about that difference between those who might prefer simply to see a site memorialised and those who wish to see it fully exhumed and excavated. These are difficult questions to address. I would like to raise a specific question brought to me by the Separation, Appropriation and Loss Initiative, which notes that the redrafted Bill refers to institutional burial grounds and the definition of ""institution"" within section 2 relates to premises occupied by women or children or both. The Separation, Appropriation and Loss Initiative is asking whether this will cover illegal exhumations and reburials of women from institutions, which is another key point because we know that there may be scenarios that have, as yet, remained uncovered and that may need to be covered by this legislation. We are all conscious that Catherine Corless's tireless work uncovered so much that had been unknown or only guessed at previously and that there may still be further revelations to come. Without the key role that she played and that other historians and archaeologists have played, we would not know, for example, about reported burials in Bessborough or the horrendous mass grave uncovered at Tuam. I want to again acknowledge Catherine Corless’s work and the work of other historians. In particular, I want to acknowledge Catherine Corless. Her work in taking out the death certificates of each of the 796 children who died at the Tuam mother and baby home gave rise to such a powerful sense of outrage at this evidence beyond doubt of a culture in which institutional and structural abuse of women and children was widespread throughout the country. The State owes her a great debt of gratitude. The Minister rightly said that what happened at Tuam is a stain on our national conscience and people like Catherine Corless have been so important in uncovering those stains. Throughout the past decades there are those who have shown incredible strength, resilience and determination in telling their stories. They have faced up to a powerful State and church that have been happy to maintain the "	spk_306
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-03-02	dail	33	Situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including the recent Amnesty International Report: Statements	dbsect_38	"I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the situation in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories on behalf of the Labour Party. The recent report of Amnesty International that we are debating was unequivocal in its findings as to the extent of land seizures, unlawful killings, restrictions on movement, denial of citizenship of Palestinians and other breaches of international law by the Israeli state. Indeed, the Minister referred to those breaches of international law. The report documents a system of oppression and domination over Palestinians which, in the words of the report, amounts to the international definition of ""apartheid"". The report documents evidence of policies of segregation, dispossession and exclusion. Will the Minister advocate for approval of the recommendations of the Amnesty International report? He has said he does not want to use the term ""apartheid"" because he does not think it is helpful but it is important that we look at why the report has made that finding and the evidence base on which Amnesty International is making that judgment. We must remember the serious and ongoing breaches of international law represented in particular by the expansion of the illegal settlements which the Minister has spoken about and, indeed, condemned on behalf of Ireland. I welcome that condemnation. However, given that we have a seat on the UN Security Council and nine months left in that position, as he said, we need to see our Government doing more to express utter condemnation at the systemic discrimination that goes on against the Palestinian people. As he also said, we also need to press further for a genuine dialogue for peace between Israel and Palestine. We need to press Israel to lift the obstacles and address the appalling conditions in which people are living, particularly in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. There are dangers to human health in those areas that are, of course, exacerbated by Covid-19. Israeli blockades impede the flow of vital humanitarian aid and medical equipment. There are enormous issues and breaches and abuses of international law going on against the Palestinian people.  In this House and the Seanad, legislators on all sides have called for action. We have called for recognition of the state of Palestine. We have called for passage of the occupied territories Bill about which my colleagues have spoken. That Bill was initiated by Senator Black in the Seanad and the Labour Party was proud to offer unequivocal support for it. The passage of that Bill through both Houses would send an important message and show Irish leadership in banning the importation of goods from occupied territories. I am looking forward to attending the second high-level forum on Palestine with Sadaka later this month. We will hear important messages from Professor Michael Lynk, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories. We, as legislators, need to step forward to support organisations such as Sadaka that are working so hard to advocate for the rights of Palestinians and the need for a peaceful resolution. As we are speaking, we have heard the appalling news that more than 2,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine. I express my support for the strong words of condemnation the Minister has uttered on behalf of Ireland of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the brutal bombardment of civilians we are seeing and the brutal destruction of cities such as Kharkiv. I support the condemnation of the Russian onslaught on Kyiv we are now seeing so chillingly with the 50 km convoy. The Labour Party stands in full solidarity with the people of Ukraine at their awful time of need. I have met with the Ukrainian ambassador and expressed that view. I have stood in protest outside the Russian embassy and will do so again this weekend. Many others will also stand there as they are standing tonight in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and we will remind ourselves of how precious democracy is and how all of us in peaceful democracies must stand up and condemn the bullying, brutal tactics of Vladimir Putin and Russia.I was a member of the foreign affairs committee when the war in Syria was going on and we were very conscious of the brutal treatment by Russia of civilians there through the government of Assad. We all have awful memories of the siege of Aleppo and I have a chilling concern that we are seeing the same tactic of brutality being used by Russia in Ukraine. We must ensure a very strong welcome is expressed to Ukrainian refugees fleeing here and that we also take steps to ensure practical measures are advocated for and taken at EU level. One such measure would be the acceptance of national identification cards in lieu of passports for Ukrainians who are fleeing and may not have access to valid travel documentation. I ask that the Minister speak with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to whom I have written in this regard, requesting that he advocate for the shoring up of the Ukrainian currency in order that those crossing the border have adequate funds to be able to afford basic supplies. That is a practical concern for many. I ask again that the Minister consider the expulsion of the Russian ambassador from Ireland given the appalling comments he has made seeking to justify the brutal invasion. In addition, I ask that he support the speedy accession of Ukraine to the European Union, as its Government and its ambassador in Ireland have requested. I am conscious that Ireland has very limited time left on the UN Security Council but it is a time when we can use our voice internationally, at the most powerful level, to advocate for peace, democracy and peaceful resolution of ongoing conflicts such as that in the Middle East and the dreadful conflict in Yemen, often referred to as the forgotten conflict. We attended a briefing on the latter earlier this week. In particular, we must press hard now to see a ceasefire in Ukraine and a peaceful resolution in order to stop the terrible killing of innocent civilians, including children, that we see going on before our eyes as we watch in appalled horror from across the world."	spk_380
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-02-22	dail	33	Citizens' Assemblies: Motion	dbsect_9	First, on behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the establishment of these two citizens' assemblies. We are glad to see this being carried out, but we are also anxious to see progress being made on the citizens' assemblies on drugs and on the future of education. Indeed, my colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, has been to the fore in seeking clear indications from the Government and particularly the Taoiseach on the timeline for the establishment of a citizens' assembly on drugs. We know what a serious and severe problem drug addiction and the current policies for dealing with drug addiction have created. The Government could look to save lives by kick-starting the process of convening a citizens' assembly on drugs. We want urgent work to be done on that, and on the citizens' assembly on the future of education. In my role as Chairperson of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality, I appreciate the enormous engagement and the massive levels of commitment that citizens have given to assemblies over the years. In particular, I pay tribute to the citizens who were involved in the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality, chaired by Dr. Catherine Day, which gave rise to such an impressive report with 45 recommendations, effectively a blueprint for achieving gender equality in Ireland. I look forward to working cross-party with colleagues on ensuring that the blueprint is implemented through our work in the committee. We will commence our public hearings next week, but we have already been involved in a great deal of work. I am mindful, however, of the point made forcefully by both Professor David Farrell and Ms Ursula Quill in  With regard to the two assemblies being discussed today, the Dublin Citizens' Assembly is an important and valuable one. I look forward to the deliberations there. I am grateful to my colleagues, Labour Party councillors and our Lord Mayor, Ms Alison Gilliland, for their insights and the feedback they have given me on their views. Many of our councillors, and other councillors too, have expressed concerns that their ability to carry out work on behalf of their electors is stymied by the absence of real executive power at present. We all are conscious that, by European standards, Ireland has a much less effective tier of local government. There are insufficient powers at local government level. We might contrast that with the type of city powers we see in cities such as London, where the mayor, Mr. Sadiq Khan, has exercised real power, and in cities in the US. A city diplomacy unit is now being established by the US State Department. We must look at models elsewhere to ensure we have meaningful and effective local government, and that the issue of a directly elected lord mayor is taken up and brought forward, but the mayor must have sufficient power to make it an effective office. I am conscious that there is already draft legislation to introduce a directly elected mayor, which was brought forward by the Green Party the last time it was in government. My colleague, Councillor Dermot Lacey, has pointed out that this legislation could be reintroduced to avoid delaying local government reform any longer. I am sure the citizens' assembly will look at this. I hope it will be an inclusive assembly because many of those who live in Dublin are not from Dublin. It is vital that all residents in Dublin city and county are included. I note it is proposed to have 12 councillors participating. We need to hear why that number was considered. I am aware there is a proposed Seanad amendment to include a higher number, but we must be mindful that a citizens' assembly should primarily comprise citizens. There must be a clear balance there on membership. I also welcome the proposed Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity. As spokesperson on climate for the Labour Party, I am conscious that we have not only a climate emergency but also a biodiversity emergency in Ireland. We have tragic levels of extinction of species worldwide. There are approximately 31,000 species known to occur in Ireland, yet the conservation status of only about 10% has been assessed. There is a fundamental knowledge gap in how we tackle biodiversity in Ireland, how we protect species and how we insure against further loss of biodiversity. I implore the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity to look at these issues, in particular, and to address that knowledge gap. I welcome this motion and offer the support of the Labour Party for it, but I ask the Minister of State to move urgently to establish the other two promised citizens' assemblies on drug use and on education.	spk_106
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-02-22	dail	33	Carbon Tax: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]	dbsect_12	I am glad to speak on behalf of the Labour Party in a debate that purports to address twin crises - the climate crisis and the cost-of-living crisis.I have indeed spoken previously about these twin crises that we are all facing in society. All of us across the House are hearing from constituents, families and individuals about the astronomical increases in the cost of living and the bills that everyone is experiencing, in my constituency of Dublin Bay South and elsewhere too. People are telling me about the increases that they are seeing in the cost of their rent, childcare, fuel bills and groceries. Inflation is at a 20-year high and this is really hitting hard. We heard today from Barnardos regarding the impact on child poverty that this is also having.  The Labour Party takes the cost-of-living crisis seriously. Just recently, on 26 January, we tabled a motion offering real solutions to address the crisis. The motion called for the transformation of the national minimum wage to a living wage, increases in social welfare payments linked to the rate of inflation, and a windfall levy on excessive profits in the energy, transport, housing and food sectors due to rising prices. Unfortunately, the motion was opposed by the Government and did not pass. Despite the record tax take in 2021, we believe that insufficient action has been taken by the Government both in the latest budget, and indeed in what was recently a mini-budget in all but name. The measures introduced simply did not go far enough to address the very serious cost-of-living crisis being faced by so many in this country. That is why we cannot support the Government amendment to this motion. However, we in the Labour Party, as with all of those on the left or green-reds, take the climate crisis seriously too. We recognise the urgent need for measures to tackle the climate emergency, reduce our climate emissions and tackle the biodiversity crisis that we also face. That is why we support measures to tackle climate, including measures introduced by this Government such as the establishment of a Citizens' Assembly on biodiversity, which we debated earlier, together with the climate action plan targets that we have welcomed. We also supported, with some reservations, the Government retrofitting plan. That is why we have also supported the introduction of a carbon tax.  That is also why we disagree with the Sinn Féin position on carbon tax and support the Social Democrats' amendment to the motion. The reality is that Sinn Féin does not take climate seriously. For them, climate can wait, apparently. The party does not see the urgent need to introduce measures to tackle emissions and the party cannot be trusted on climate. We believe that parties that profess to be serious about climate do not oppose carbon taxes just as parties professing to be socialist do not oppose taxes on wealth and property taxes. Green-reds believe that properly targeted carbon taxes can reduce emissions and redistribute wealth in accordance with the principle that the polluter pays.  I was proud to stand earlier with the Not Here, Not Anywhere group of activists campaigning on green issues and to hear their arguments in support of more urgent measures to tackle climate. For them as for us, carbon tax is patently not the only mechanism to tackle the climate emergency. In conjunction with wealth taxes, carbon taxes can deter harmful patterns of behaviour, can ensure that the biggest and wealthiest emitters pay the most and can ensure redistribution of wealth to transfer benefits to those who would otherwise not have the ability to meet the cost of retrofitting and other necessary measures. Carbon tax is clearly not the only mechanism to tackle the climate emergency, nor is it in any way the only reason for an increase in the cost of living, or even an increase in the cost of fuel. I have spoken already about the increases that we are all aware of in the cost of living, where it is not just fuel and energy. We are talking about increases that people are facing in their rent and childcare costs, and in their food and grocery bills. Carbon tax is not the reason for those increases.  We know that in the fuel increases and energy price increases that we have seen just today, the primary cause for these is Russian aggression in Ukraine. Those are international causes that we accept. We do not say that the Government can or should be blamed for all of the increases in the costs of living or in inflation. Government, however, should act to ensure the more equitable redistribution of wealth and a more equitable and effective introduction of a carbon tax that would include a windfall tax on big emitters and on energy companies that are experiencing supernormal profits during a time of such real hardship for so many people.  In the context of the crisis we are experiencing, there is clearly an urgent need to ensure ring-fencing of carbon tax revenues in order that there is a just transition, and as socialists and social democrats are arguing across Europe, that targeted measures are introduced to address these twin crises for so many. In budget 2022, we in the Labour Party called for a new, targeted carbon tax credit. Combined with targeted increases in the fuel allowance and social welfare payments this would have addressed the cost of living for those at risk of fuel poverty. Our carbon tax credit for 2022 would have been set at €200, would be refundable and allocated on a household basis. It would be available up to an income limit of €50,000 and to those living in homes with a building energy rating, BER, of less than B2. Over time, the credit would be phased out as homes are retrofitted and renewable energy generation is increased. I have spoken previously about how a very ambitious and targeted retrofitting programme can address both of these crises and I know that there are people across the floor of the House who recognise that. We in the Labour Party have also called for the introduction of a penalty-free derogation on VAT applied to energy. Our motion on 26 January included that measure. The Government must examine the need to reduce the VAT wedge on energy and fuel bills. This is eminently achievable and is an approach that is being adopted by EU member states led by socialist and social democratic governments. This needs to happen in a time-limited way and we in Labour have done the maths on this. A six-month drop in VAT on fuel and energy would cost approximately €200 million. This will cost less than the €200 energy bill rebate to be given in April but will be more impactful and targeted for those in society who need it most. Again, we recall the record tax take for 2021, with VAT raising €1 billion more than was projected. We must see how best to target that and to return some of that windfall to people who are most experiencing hardship at present.  We support the updating of the strategy to combat energy poverty, as well as the initiative to establish a cross-departmental task force on energy poverty. It must be genuinely cross-departmental to achieve its targets. Finally, we believe that the retrofitting programme must be more carefully targeted. In the constructive criticism that we have offered of the national retrofitting scheme, while very much welcoming its introduction, we have expressed concern that it may not make enough of a difference in tackling both the cost of living and climate change for many households. It is insufficiently targeted at those households that cannot afford the deep retrofit, that do not have the savings of €25,000 and that cannot afford to borrow the cost. It must, therefore, be reviewed to see how it can be targeted in a better way.  Just as we did during the Covid-19 pandemic, we must trust the science. The mantra when we hear about climate change is based on the fundamental principle that we must be honest about the nature of this crisis. As Extinction Rebellion has said, politicians must tell the truth. We must, therefore, be honest. The carbon tax must form part of our national strategy to incentivise climate-friendly behaviour and to fund necessary infrastructure to aid that transition. The polluters must pay but that argument does not exempt us all from this responsibility. We must all recognise, those who are serious about climate, that Ireland continues to be far too reliant on fossil fuels. Wind energy accounts for only 40% of our renewable energy and we need to reach a target of 80% in eight years. We still do not have a national strategy to scale up affordable hydrogen production.  We also know that private equity companies with operations in Ireland are profiteering from the climate crisis by investing in fossil fuels. We need to see much more decisive action on this, on the importation of fracked gas and on so much more. Lending voices to these matters would be a far better use of parliamentary time than seeking to convince constituents and citizens that any sort of moratorium on the carbon tax would solve their problems. I reiterate that carbon tax, properly targeted, can reduce emissions, redistribute wealth and have a place in the package of measures that we need take to tackle the climate crisis. We also need to see very serious actions by Government along the lines that the Labour Party proposed on 26 January to tackle the cost-of-living crisis that is causing such real hardship for so many families and households and I know that all Members are hearing this.	spk_149
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-02-17	dail	33	National Retrofitting Scheme: Statements	dbsect_33	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the national retrofitting scheme and to very much welcome it. I think there is a broad welcome for the scheme. It is undoubtedly a win-win to see a national retrofitting programme. Many of us on the Opposition benches had indeed been looking for this to be rolled out for some time, so it is most welcome. I thank the Minister and his officials for the briefing last week with Opposition spokespersons, which I certainly found very useful. Clearly, there are enormous benefits and opportunities in a national retrofitting scheme. There are environmental benefits, without a doubt, and also social and economic benefits. I was struck by something the Minister said about the scheme on retrofitting which was that perhaps the biggest benefit is that of public health and the health of individuals and families. That is a crucial point, too. In the context of the dual crises of climate change and the cost of living, clearly, retrofitting can offer a long-term opportunity to ensure that both can be tackled and that we will see environmental benefits and economic and financial benefits for those who are experiencing real fuel and energy poverty. Indeed, I know all Members will have received harrowing emails and contacts from constituents across the country who are experiencing that real fuel poverty. Energy efficiency and measures to increase energy efficiency are clearly very important to address the root causes of energy poverty. Therefore, I very much welcome it. However, I must say that having just come back from canvassing around Sandymount and Irishtown, I have heard the local residents express intense frustration about the cost of living and, in particular, the cost of home rental and home ownership, the lack of any homes to rent or own in the local area, and a scepticism about Government capacity to deliver real change on that big cost of living issue and, in particular, on delivering on homes. I mention that because I think it is at the core of this debate about retrofitting. What I am hearing from many is a concern, if not a scepticism, about whether this will make that real difference in tackling both cost of living and climate change for many households. For the Labour Party, there is a real concern about inequality and a lack of targeted funding. It is clear, from my reading of it, that households that can afford a deep retrofit and have savings of €25,000 or that can pay for 50% of the cost will reap greater benefits than households that can only afford the more minor works and do not have that upfront money. I am aware that the Minister has stated that there will be a financing package. Indeed, it sounds really positive. We have heard that it will be available this year, and that in the meantime there is an anticipation that households that have accumulated savings during Covid, and some have, undoubtedly, will be able to commence work on the retrofit. However, there is a difficulty in that those households that may have accumulated savings may need a greater incentive to spend that money upfront. I was interested to hear at the briefing that research shows that people need to see at least a 50% subsidy or injection of funds from Government in order to incentivise retrofit. I think it is more than that. People also need to know, for example, that they are going to be living in a house long enough to be able to gain the benefit of the savings on fuel bills over a period of time. That may simply not be the case for many households. It is not just that financial incentive; I think we also need to look at how we incentivise people to take the step to engage in the sort of deep retrofit that this plan wants to encourage. There may be more radical ways to do it. Providing upfront grants of two thirds of the cost, combined with low-cost loans, might offer a more attractive solution to many households. We need to be very creative about how we look at incentivising households and families to take this step. The lack of targeting is also a problem. We need to better support households that do not have savings and those that, even once the financing scheme comes in later this year, simply cannot afford to borrow. We know the gap in an energy bill for a house with a rating of G or F, relative to a house with a B2 rating, is approximately €3,500 per year. We know that energy prices are increasing, so that figure is sure to increase. We really need to target Government subsidies and supports in retrofitting for households that are most in need of that upgrade to bring them up to the B2 rating.  As we introduce retrofitting measures that are crucial to ensuring households are being taken out of fuel poverty on a long-term basis, rather than just through temporary stop-gap measures, we need to ensure that money goes to all low-income households and not just to those dependent on social protection funding or in social housing. The nature of the housing crisis - and we are all hearing about it everywhere - means that many families outside of the net of State assistance are really floundering. Again, just today, I heard from a household where somebody getting a new job means that they are going to be removed from the social protection net. We are all very aware of these real circumstances. For many people, they will be left behind by this scheme. The Labour Party alternative budget referred to a targeted retrofitting programme limited to households with incomes of less than €50,000. In addition, it was stated that houses would have to have a building energy rating, BER, of less than B2. What we sought, therefore, was a targeted scheme that was targeted not just on income but also on those who are more at risk of fuel poverty. I ask the Minister to look at a more targeted and equitable approach to funding the scheme, and indeed at more radical measures like the idea of upfront funding to a greater extent than the 50% that is generally anticipated. There are also concerns around equity for renters. The issue has been raised already in the debate. Indeed, I raised it with the Minister at the briefing last week. There is a real concern, which I have expressed, as has the Labour Party housing spokesperson, Senator Moynihan, that there is a lack of protections for renters in situations where their landlord may seek to engage of a deep retrofit or a retrofitting of a type that will necessitate the renter moving out of the home. What we do not want to see is the retrofitting process being used as an excuse to raise rents or evict tenants. We must ensure that there are strong protections for renters and that renters will also be able to reap the benefits of retrofitting. To reiterate, retrofitting offers immense benefits for anyone whose home is currently cold, badly-insulated or damp. However, we want to see stronger protections for renters. I wish to raise an issue in regard to the warmer homes scheme with the Minister, which I raised with him last week at the briefing. I also previously submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister to ask about amending the SEAI rules on the one home-one visit restriction in the warmer homes scheme to allow homeowners to reapply for works that were no supported by grants in the 2014 scheme, such as external wall insulation on houses on which the walls are solid, and to consider loosening the problematic ten-year limit. In his reply, the Minister stated that there are no plans to ease the burden on lower-income households which are particularly vulnerable to energy poverty, but my understanding of this new scheme is that an applicant with a BER of E or below can now reapply with some scope for certain homes with a D rating. I see the Minister nodding. That is a very welcome development. I am glad that the position has been reversed. There is still the concern about the warmer homes scheme and delays in the process. I know that others have pointed out that there is a 26-month national average delay between application and completion.  That brings me to a final point that has been expressed to me by many constituents and others. There is a frustration or scepticism about the possibility or capacity to deliver in a situation where there are insufficient numbers of people with the necessary skills in construction. We need to see a significant ramping-up of apprenticeship programmes for young women and men in construction skills. We need to see Government committing to fund great programmes like the St. Andrew's programme that is run by the resource centre on Pearse Street.It runs a really positive construction skills course. Those sorts of courses need to be significantly funded because, otherwise, even the homeowners who have the funding and wish to proceed with a deep retrofit, are really incentivised to do so and are going through the one-stop shop may find it very difficult to do so in practice because of that serious skills shortage. We need to see joined-up thinking in the context of the retrofitting scheme, with a much greater commitment to enhancing the numbers of apprenticeships. I have also raised this issue with the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris. I have been contacted by a constituent whose property has a G building energy rating, BER, and who was delighted at the announcement of the scheme but then discovered he was not eligible for the scheme as it pertains to windows and floor heating as those grant amounts can only be drawn down through the one-stop shop scheme. I ask the Minister to examine the matter to ensure that people will be eligible to apply through the one-stop shop for those sorts of measures. I refer to people who live in older and draftier homes and wish to engage in retrofitting, but perhaps not the deeper retrofitting model that is most incentivised. There is great interest in and enthusiasm for a national retrofitting scheme. The challenge for all of us, as legislators, is to ensure the scheme is sufficiently targeted to bring people out of poverty and to address both the climate and cost of living crises.	spk_248

It is really important that we are debating this very timely legislation and it is really good to hear the very honest contributions to the debate from the men and women who have spoken. When I was first elected to these Houses in 2007, to the Seanad, I was pregnant with my second daughter. It was shocking to me how difficult it was to accommodate a baby within these precincts. I was very grateful to the women Members who had gone before me on whose initiative a crèche had been established. After some difficulty, I was able to access the crèche which was hugely helpful. It meant that I could run over and breastfeed a small baby and contribute to Seanad debates on a part-time basis. In those early months, one really wants to be spending as much time at home as possible but at the same time, as an elected representative, when there was no provision for maternity leave, there was an imperative to also be contributing. This Bill is an important part of a whole package of measures that are necessary to modernise our Parliament, as Deputy Carroll MacNeill said herself, and to make it more inclusive, more friendly towards women, towards men with caring responsibilities, more family friendly and more flexible. It is timely because as we are coming through the pandemic, all of us have learned the benefits of remote working. All of us are navigating that process of trying to facilitate more working from home. When we are seeing that debate taking place in workplaces more generally, it is very important that we in the Houses of Oireachtas would lead by example and seek to facilitate remote working. It is unfortunate that it will require a constitutional amendment to do so. I have spoken with my colleague Deputy Howlin, who has long experience of Dáil procedure, and he says that it should be possible to allow for committees to conduct hearings remotely and to continue to do so. We are doing it already but there is this strange anomaly whereby we can participate in committee meetings remotely from our offices but not from outside the precincts. I live a ten-minute cycle away from Leinster House, in Dublin Bay South. I cannot participate remotely in a committee meeting from my home office but I can participate from my office here in the precinct. There are anomalies that require addressing and it is very important, therefore, that we bring this legislation forward. As others have said, this is also in keeping with recommendations that were made by Mary Upton's excellent committee on a family friendly and inclusive parliament and with the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality. I thank Deputy Carroll MacNeill for her reference to my work in that regard. I am very proud and honoured to have been appointed as Chairperson of the Oireachtas Special Committee on Gender Equality. Our brief or remit is to ensure the implementation of the 45 recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality. One of those recommendations in particular, recommendation No. 23, relates to improving family-friendly practices for all representatives elected to public office. The Citizens' Assembly recommended flexible working options, not just within Parliament but also at local authority level. It also recommended making maternity, paternity and parental leave available to all elected representatives, including Ministers. That is long overdue. I was glad, in another role as Vice Chair of the women's caucus, along with Senator Fiona O'Loughlin, to meet the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and hear his proposals for bringing forward maternity, paternity and parental leave for public representatives.  There is clearly a momentum behind these measures and that is really important. The Oireachtas Committee on Gender Equality will be putting forward very practical recommendations to Government as to how to implement the Citizen's Assembly recommendations. As Deputy Carroll MacNeill has said, among our recommendations will be how we bring forward those three recommendations for constitutional change to create a more inclusive Constitution, one that is updated and that provides for gender equality, a more inclusive definition of family and that will change the very sexist language around women's role and the role of mothers. The amendment that Deputy Carroll MacNeill is proposing in this Bill would be an integral part of a package of amendments to be put to the people in one day. That would be a really good way of approaching this, not so much as a stand-alone amendment but one that is very much part of an amendment that is about creating a more gender-equal Ireland where women have a more equal status and, in particular, where women are more facilitated, supported and encouraged in running for public office. We should not forget that our Parliament still looks very male, stale and pale - perhaps not as much as it was when I was first elected to the Seanad in 2007, but it is certainly still very, very male. After my election to the Dáil last year, I was very struck by how different it is from the Seanad. Only 23% of Deputies are female. There is 40% women's representation in the Seanad. Let us make the Dáil more representative of women and let us bring forward a range of measures to do that.	spk_365

This legislation has long been promised by the Government. Indeed, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, promised it back in 2018 when we were debating the abortion legislation. A Private Members' Bill to provide for safe access zones to protect women and healthcare staff will be debated on Committee Stage in Government time in the Seanad tomorrow. Why will the Government not simply bring that legislation further? I am glad it is giving Government time for it, but I understand from the spring legislative programme that the Government still intends to bring forward its own legislation rather than allowing this Private Members' Bill, which has cross-party support and the support of doctors, healthcare providers, Together for Safety and other advocacy groups, to be brought forward. There is an extremely troubling report from Together for Safety that anti-choice activists have been obtaining information about dates and times of appointments for terminations so they can harass women.	spk_139

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-02-09	dail	33	Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Bill 2022: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_18	I will speak on the amendment as we are on Committee Stage. I support the amendment, on behalf of the Labour Party. It relates to an issue I raised during the Second Stage debate on the Bill, namely, the need to ensure adequate integration of renters into the proposed framework in the Bill. Clearly, the rebate for householders will be welcome, but we have criticised it as being inadequate and merely a drop in the ocean when we see the soaring cost of living crisis that so many households are facing. On Second Stage I spoke specifically about renters. We know that in Dublin Bay South as many as 44% of all properties are private rentals. Figures from  That is why the amendment is crucial, because it seeks to put in place better protections for renters, specifically to ensure that the Minister will make provision to ensure that renters receive the benefit of the rebate. As I pointed out on Second Stage, we would all hope that landlords would ensure that any saving on bills is passed onto renters, but in the absence of any safeguarding measure in the Bill this could not be guaranteed. That is why it is important that a guarantee such as this is inserted into the Bill. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. There will be a fairly united front from the Opposition in support of it. I was dismayed to learn that ten of the 11 amendments have been ruled out of order, as Deputy O'Rourke has said. I also sought to table amendments on foot of the speech I made on Second Stage, only to be told that the deadline for accepting amendments was before the start of the Second Stage debate. I am new to the Dáil, but this struck me as a really poor procedural law. We could not, therefore, have a Second Stage debate in any meaningful way because the deadline for putting forward amendments had already passed. That is the only reason I do not have an amendment on safeguarding. We had drafted an amendment on safeguarding renters, but that was disallowed by the Bills Office. That is not necessarily the call of the Minister, but it is a flaw in the procedure. That is exacerbated by the fact that out of the 11 amendments Members managed to put forward, ten have been ruled out of order. Therefore, this is the only amendment we will have a chance to debate on the floor of the House. That is really unfortunate. It is an important amendment to support and I am glad to do so on behalf of the Labour Party. It will provide more robust safeguards for renters, which is important, in particular in the context of report today on the crucial shortage of rental properties and the 10% increase year on year in the cost of rent across the country.  I wish to emphasise that this is not just a Dublin issue; this is about the cost of rent across the country and the lack of protections for renters more generally. This amendment seeks to address that in the context of a Bill that is about addressing the extortionate rise in the cost of living.	spk_302

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-02-03	dail	33	Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_39	I welcome the opportunity to speak for the Labour Party on this Bill and to express our disappointment that this is what we are seeing from the Government as a way of addressing the crisis in the cost of living that is sweeping across the country and affecting every community. As we are coming through the crisis of the pandemic, the Government has to confront the twin crises of the climate emergency and the cost-of-living crisis, which has manifested so strikingly and seriously for so many families, households and individuals across the country. While we accept that this is well meaning and that households will welcome the rebate proposed in the Bill, we are of the view that it is simply insufficient and inadequate to deal with the reality of the spiralling cost of living. We know that households are expecting, on electricity and gas alone, more than €400 of an increase on their bill this year following the price increases imposed. We know there are soaring costs associated with housing, rental, childcare, even in purchasing food and groceries. It is deeply disappointing to see Government putting forward this drop in the ocean. If I may mix metaphors, it is clutching at straws in putting forward this drop in the ocean as a way to address the crisis. Indeed if what we are hearing in terms of leaks from the Minister of State's colleagues' parliamentary party meeting last night is correct, it appears both the Taoiseach and Tánaiste agree with our analysis that the measure as proposed in the Bill is not enough to address the cost-of-living crisis. It is not enough of an answer. Much more needs to be done. We are hearing all sorts of kites being flown as to what can be done by Government. It is very disappointing to see that all we are getting by way of concrete proposals and legislation is a €100 rebate. It is tokenistic. It seems somewhat random if I may say so. It is certainly not a targeted or strategic way to address the reality of increased costs of living for so many people. This view is shared by so many of our constituents. Looking at my own emails from constituents in Dublin Bay South today, a constituent writes that she is a working mother with a two-year-old son. She and her husband both work. They are writing to a public representative for the first time ever, out of pure desperation. I know the Minister of State is hearing it in his own constituency as we all are. They have been involved in what she describes as excruciating bidding wars with insane prices in housing. They are trying to buy a house. They are both earning, they have relatively good incomes but they cannot afford a home. We are hearing from people renting about increased costs of rental. We are hearing from people who themselves are not struggling but who are incensed. A constituent wrote to me today saying they are growing more and more annoyed about the communications about the €100 rebate and pointing out that this initiative will cost the Government over €200 million, which could be spent in a significantly better way. My constituent describes it as a populist reactive gesture which does not help those who are in genuine poverty or genuine fuel poverty. That really sums up what we all on the Opposition benches are hearing in constituents and members of the public as to their view on this measure. We accept that there are issues beyond the Government's control driving up the cost of living. The Russian aggression on the borders of Ukraine is clearly a case in point. Yet there is much more that can be done at domestic level through legislation or other policy interventions to address the cost of living and the impact that international issues like the Russian aggression are having on individuals and households. We are saying that the Government can do more to address the scale of the crisis. For example, one of the key reasons the cost of living and rise in fuel prices are hitting so hard is that wages have not risen. Here is a way of addressing this. Let us look at how we can address the wage issue.We know that people on low pay and those in receipt of the minimum wage are the most affected of all by increases in the cost of living where they have seen no commensurate increases in their incomes. Here is one alternative way the Government can address this, namely, by increasing Ireland's minimum wage of €10.50 per hour to an hourly living wage of €12.90. Instead, we see a measure that is simply not strategic, not targeted and, therefore, not enough to address the cost of living for people. The Bill is flawed in its approach to renters in particular. We will table amendments on that, as will others. Looking again at my constituency of Dublin Bay South, as many as 44% of all properties there are private rentals. That is a very large proportion of households in my constituency and my local area. In the south inner city, Portobello, Ranelagh, Rathmines and other areas in the constituency, we see large numbers of individuals and families renting. The lack of integration of renters into the proposed statutory framework of the Bill is concerning. The Minister of State addressed this in his speech. We would welcome copies of the speech in order that we might look at that. He stated that he hopes to work with, I think, the RTB on this issue. The figures we have show that as many as half or more of households that rent will have their landlord's details on the electricity bill. That needs to be addressed because while clearly it is to be hoped that landlords will pass on the small saving in bills to renters, we cannot guarantee that. As I understand it, there is an absence of safeguarding measures in the Bill. The Bill looks at fuel prices, but let us look at the crisis in the cost of living in other areas. Let us hear from the Government about measures to address that. Daft.ie tells us that rents are rising at an annual rate of 6.8% and that Dublin is the sixth most expensive capital city in the world for renters. The average rent for a one-bed unit in my constituency is €1,643 per month. Let us contrast that with stagnant wages and low pay. The only capital cities which can compete with ours on rent are cities like Hong Kong, Singapore, Washington and London. We need to ensure that renters are getting adequate safeguards. The Bill clearly does not go anywhere near addressing the issue of rent increases, but let us ensure at the very least that savings on energy bills are passed on to renters. That is a key issue. I hope the Government will work with me and with my colleague, Senator Moynihan, our housing spokesperson, to see our renters' rights Bill passed. That Bill would deal with three key issues that clearly impact renters' experience and quality of life, including security of tenure and the cost of rent. We are calling for a three-year rent freeze and for measures to be passed to give renters greater rights to quality life and things like the right to rent an unfurnished apartment or home, which is the norm in other European cities. Our Bill would also end no-fault evictions and restrict the grounds on which a landlord can end a tenancy. What we are seeking is greater protections for renters. That in itself, particularly that three-year rent freeze, will help to address the cost of living for many, ensuring then that rents are capped and that renters have greater security. I have talked to constituents, especially those who are coming to Ireland from other countries to work and who are appalled at the lack of protection for renters here compared with their own countries. I am told that the norm in other European cities is a three-year rental agreement. Why are we in Ireland wedded to 12-month leases? That gives nobody security. It does not give private landlords security either. I know we have many so-called accidental landlords, and I hear from many constituents in that position too. Why not move to that European norm of a three-year lease as the legal basis for rental agreements? We need to look really carefully at how we can protect renters better and ensure that we target cost-of-living increases in rental and tenancy costs. That is a key issue that is causing so much hardship across the country, particularly in our cities. Last week, the Labour Party put forward a motion on the cost of living which sought to create or to propose a broader package of measures to ensure we address some of these issues - not just energy prices but also issues such as the price of accommodation, rent and house purchase. We put that motion forward also in a context in which we have seen from Oxfam figures showing that there has been a significant increase of wealth for a very small number of individuals in our society. Those figures were very striking and show that the wealth of Ireland's nine billionaires had increased by nearly 60% since March 2020 while most people have seen incomes and wages stagnate and the cost of rent, fuel and food increase. With all the talk and all the really admirable solidarity we have seen as we have gone through the Covid pandemic and the public health restrictions required by it, it is frustrating to read of these figures, particularly when we know how much fuel and energy prices are rising, how much childcare costs are rising and how much rent has risen for so many. That context makes this proposed measure feel tokenistic. It requires us to put forward a systematic approach to reducing the cost of living in all areas. That is what we sought to do in our motion last week. We were very disappointed the Government did not accept the motion in the good faith and the constructive spirit in which it was offered. Among the measures we put forward were the introduction of an emergency energy costs relief package for households. We called for targeted support for those in energy poverty through the widening of access to the fuel allowance and the introduction of a refundable carbon tax credit for low-income households. We had proposed that measure in our alternative budget last October, so it is not a new idea but, rather, something we believe would offer a much more targeted way of addressing rising fuel costs. It would offer practical support to people while supporting the phasing out in the longer term of fossil fuels, a much more realistic approach to the task at hand than an effective subsidy of fossil fuels. Ours is a measure that seeks to address the other crisis I have mentioned, which, I know, the Minister of State and his party are very aware of, namely the climate crisis and the crisis of rising carbon emissions. We also call for a windfall levy to be imposed on excessive profits made in the energy sector to offset rising prices. We have seen such a measure introduced in other jurisdictions recently. That would look at targeting not only the cost-of-living crisis but also that key crisis of the climate. I wish to locate the debate on the cost of living and this debate within the context of that climate crisis. It sometimes feels as if there is a rather disjointed approach to policy on the part of the Government. We heard of that disjointed or disconnected approach in the leaks from the parliamentary party meetings of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael last night, with apparently different views being put forward by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste as to how to address the cost of living, whether to increase the rebate or look at other measures. We are all agog, waiting to see what will come out of that. It is a disjointed approach, however. We see that disconnection even more when we try to link the climate crisis with the cost-of-living crisis. Let us not forget that in November and December there was a period of about six weeks when we were in this Chamber several times per week, rightly, discussing Ireland's need to meet its ambitious climate targets. I and my party support the Government in seeking to meet those ambitious targets and we support the carbon tax, but we are disappointed to see a lack of joined-up thinking when we see measures such as this come from the Government without commensurate measures to address the climate crisis, which has not gone away just because we are focusing on inflation in this debate. While being conscious that inflation is at a 20-year high, we need to ensure that the measures we are taking to address that crisis for people will also match the measures we take on the climate crisis. For example, a number of people around the country availed of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, better energy warmer homes scheme for smaller insulation projects many years ago but are now seeking to undertake further works which would have the effect of reducing energy costs for people while also reducing emissions. Many people are excluded from the scheme because a period of ten years has not yet passed since the initial project. That is problematic. It would be easy for the Government to fix that. Doing so would address both climate and cost-of-living issues. Last month, I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to ask if he would amend the SEAI rules on the one home, one visit restriction on the warmer homes scheme to allow homeowners to reapply for works that were not supported by grants in the 2014 scheme, such as external wall insulation on houses in which the walls are solid and therefore ineligible, and if he would consider loosening that problematic ten-year limit. The Minister, in his reply, revealed that there were no such plans to ease the burden on lower income households, which are particularly vulnerable to energy poverty. I would like to hear more from the Minister of State about the logic of that decision. It simply does not seem logical to me and does not seem to connect with a joined-up approach to Government thinking. I am conscious that Ireland is very far off our retrofitting target of 50,000 and that there is a need to accelerate rapidly the rate at which we are enabling people to retrofit homes. Lots of measures are being taken at ground level to address this. Just last Friday I had the pleasure of officiating at a graduation ceremony for a group of people who had just finished an intensive programme in construction skills.It was being run by the brilliant people at St. Andrew's Resource Centre on Pearse Street in co-operation with a range of State agencies, including the Dublin Port Company, which supplied the land for the course to be run. The organisers of the course, which has an excellent 63% job placement rate, are putting together a course on retrofitting and green homes with a view to upskilling sufficient numbers of people to undertake the smaller scale retrofitting projects that will make a difference to many individuals and households experiencing energy poverty. It will also make a major difference to meeting our domestic climate targets for households. The inspirational approach being taken by those involved in this training programme is admirable and they have been supported by Ministers and Deputies from across the parties, yet they are scrambling for funding to continue the programme. This is just one example of where we see initiatives that would greatly assist in addressing fuel poverty issues and the climate crisis but where we do not see joined-up Government thinking in supporting them. We are proposing measures at national level through the Dáil. We are also looking for Government support for local initiatives. We believe that this sort of joined-up thinking would be preferable to the tokenistic, scattergun or even confetti approach that is being taken with the sort of measure before the House today. We need to see more targeted measures to tackle the cost of living. I cannot say that enough. We need to see radical measures like a three-year rent freeze, cuts to public transport prices and the carbon tax credit proposed in our budget. These are the types of measures that will make a real difference. We must be conscious that the reality of low pay and job insecurity for many people is being exaggerated by the current inflation figures. That is the stark context of the €100 rebate. It is inadequate when contrasted with average heating price increases of more than €770 or when considered in light of data from the Parliamentary Budget Office suggesting that inflation will offset increases in the contributory State pension such that the purchasing power the pension carries will decrease. Given that we are in a context of rising inflation and we are conscious of the reality of low pay and job insecurity for far too many, the more targeted package of measures that we are calling for needs to be adopted by the Government so that people do not have to make a call between paying for food and paying for energy, which is the reality for too many. We need to see more ambitious, more targeted and more strategic approaches from the Government, approaches that show joined-up thinking and a co-ordinated tackling of the two giant crises facing us, namely, the climate emergency and the crisis that is being felt by all too many in the cost of living and spiralling increases in rents, housing costs, fuel, food and, indeed, childcare, which is an issue on which I hope we will see radical measures being taken by the Government. We will be pushing for that.	spk_332
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-01-27	dail	33	Higher Education Authority Bill 2022: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_32	"I am glad to speak for the Labour Party on this important Bill. I am grateful to my colleague Senator Hoey, who is our spokesperson on higher education, for giving me the benefit of her insights. Obviously, I too have a strong interest in this area, having served a number of terms as a Senator for Dublin University.I am also very proud of my long association with the law school in Trinity College where for many years I taught and carried out research and administration, which is an important part of any academic job. I am passionate about higher education and teaching. I miss my students and the role of an academic. It is a job that many people go to with a real vocation for teaching and engaging with students. It was very appropriate that the Minister started his speech on the Bill by acknowledging the enormous adaptability and significant work that has been put in by staff, students and administrators in third level institutions over the past 22 months in adapting to Covid-19. We all acknowledge that it has not been easy. It has been a major burden, especially on students. All of us have heard from parents and students who have been distressed at the lack of face-to-face interaction, the lack of ability to be present on campuses, the lack of capacity to mix with peers and lecturers, and the major disadvantage they have been placed at as a result. There has been a detrimental impact on their studies, but also on their personal and social development. Any of us who are parents, or who know young people who are students, will be well aware of the huge difficulties and problems that has caused for many students and their families. We also acknowledge and commend the staff who have done their very best in very difficult circumstances to provide high-quality teaching, albeit not face to face but remotely. It has been very difficult for everyone so it was appropriate that the Minister acknowledged that. I also want to join him in commending all those engaged in college communities at every level of further and higher education, including universities, colleges and institutes of further education, where we have seen such enormous effort put in to adapt to Covid-19. It is so good to see campuses coming alive again and to see staff, students, administrators and all the communities on college campuses being able to engage face to face and be present again. I will also refer briefly to the gendered impacts of Covid-19 at third level. This is something many of us will be very conscious of. I should say that I have had engagement through the Athena Swan programme. It is a great programme that we have seen being rolled out across the university sector in this country, as it has been elsewhere, which seeks to ensure that women have equal opportunities to men on campuses for promotion, in particular. We know that Athena Swan has now gone beyond gender. It is also looking at equality, diversity and inclusion programmes more broadly. We knew even before Covid-19 that there were real problems with discrimination against women at third level. Micheline Sheehy Skeffington, who brought a case against the National University of Ireland, Galway, highlighted inbuilt difficulties for women seeking promotion. I again pay tribute to the Minister's predecessor, former Minister of State, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, who brought forward women-only professorships, somewhat controversially, although I defended her very strongly. The evidence of the need for such professorships was so clear as was the provision of positive action measures at third level to address the inbuilt obstacles facing women in career progression. That brings me back to the point about Covid-19. While gains have been made through those professorships and the Athena Swan programme, with Covid we have unfortunately seen a particularly detrimental impact on women academics whose research output - numerous studies have shown this - has suffered more than that of male colleagues. Across all professions and careers, women have borne the disproportionate burden of home schooling to the detriment of career progression. In any debate on third level and the updating of its governance models, let us focus on the need to ensure we have not rowed back on progress made in addressing gender inequality. Figures on women in professorship positions at higher levels are still very skewed against them. We have seen, very happily, a woman provost elected in Trinity College Dublin and women are now heading up other higher education institutions. It is great to see that progress being made, but we are all very conscious that there is still a lot to be done to ensure we do not have gender inequality in third level. There are clearly other issues around diversity, especially in respect of economic disadvantage and class bias, which is something I have worked on in Trinity's law school scholarship programme. We have got a very strong model with the Trinity access programme, as have other universities and colleges, in trying to address the problem of inbuilt lower levels of progression to third level for students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. That is something that has to be addressed. I do not think any debate on third level governance should take place without reference to that. There are some specific provisions in the Bill where more could be done on diversity. A debate is needed on third level governance. As the Minister said, this legislation seeks to bring the statutory framework for the HEA up to date, given that the current legislation is 50 years old and has been in place since 1971. We need to acknowledge that despite the need to update that legislation, the higher education sector has played a major role in the development of our society and country. The contribution made by academics from all colleges and universities to civic engagement and public service has been immense. We have seen that throughout the pandemic but also long before it. For that reason, it is critical that this legislation must emphasise the principles of autonomy and academic freedom that have served us so well. We need to be very clear that in bringing our statutory framework for higher education governance up to date we are not creating more problems, in particular by creating a one-size-fits-all model that is over bureaucratic and treats all higher education institutions as alike when they are patently not. It is very good and very positive that the differences are acknowledged in the legislation. The Minister referred to the different sectoral Acts. The Universities Act is very different from the legislation under the 2018 Act that set up what are now the technological universities. Even within the university sector, Trinity College has a very unique governance structure that is acknowledged by the Minister and the legislation. Concerns around preserving autonomy of institutions must be addressed and brought into the legislation. There are very legitimate concerns among many of the higher education institutions, universities and colleges about a lack of regard for autonomy and difference and too much centralising of power with the Minister. Consequently, that could have a detrimental effect on academic freedom and creativity and could see a stifling of the kind of creative endeavour that has brought so much value, not just monetary but social, to our country. That is very important. There is much to welcome in the legislation. Clearly, the greater emphasis on the role of apprenticeships, and the need to update and modernise governance structures for apprenticeships and training, is very important. We would all acknowledge that, but it is also valid to speak of particular concerns. I might go through a few specific ones. I know we will speak more about them on Committee Stage. Conradh na Gaeilge has raised concerns about an insufficient emphasis on the Irish language, which is one particular point. While the provisions in sections 15 and 16 for the composition of the board of the HEA to be gender balanced are welcome, there is still a missed opportunity to create more provisions around recognition of diversity other than gender diversity. For example, if only one board member has direct experience of conditions for students, that may not be sufficient to represent the experiences of perhaps the most important stakeholders in this sector. That is crucial. We also need to ensure the legislation provides adequately for the views of academic staff, research staff and others to be heard. Trade union representation is crucial too. There is a frustration for many in the sector who feel they might be demoted to poorly defined stakeholders and that their concerns might not carry the same weight as others at the table whose voices are more clearly enshrined in the law. Having due consideration to equality, diversity and inclusion should come through and underlie all the provisions in the legislation, especially those around board membership for the HEA. There are also issues around the tone of the legislation.Section 9 enshrines as a function of the HEA that it should provide value for money for funding provided to third level institutions. There is concern among many of those in third level with regard to placing undue emphasis on monetary values of degrees and of outputs. The word ""output"" has a terribly bureaucratic connotation. It is often very hard to measure the output from universities or colleges in monetary terms. Some of the most important discoveries by researchers in history were made as a result of what would have been seen as intrinsically less monetarily valuable projects. Insulin, penicillin and Viagra are three products of immense value to Ireland's economy and the biopharmaceutical sector. These products, as we know, were all discovered by accident, as was quinine, which many of us enjoy in an occasional gin and tonic. There are lots of examples throughout history of products that were discovered as by-products of unrelated research and experimentation. I refer to the pacemaker, artificial sweeteners, Velcro, the X-ray and Play-Doh, which are all examples of discoveries that were made often as a result of projects that were being funded for completely different purposes or that were not seen as fundable. We need to be careful in this legislation that we are again giving due cognisance to the idea of creativity at academic level. President Michael D. Higgins has, given his background, spoken extensively about academic freedom. Last year, he delivered a particularly good speech at the Scholars at Risk conference on academic freedom and the value placed on education. He stated: ""Academic courses are now viewed as economic units whose success is too often judged in terms of arbitrary quantitative outputs of graduates, as opposed to the quality of the courses and the standards of academic excellence achieved by those participating in them."" He also wondered if, in future, tourists would tramp through universities and be told tales of where lectures were once given and of disputations, brilliant expositions encountered or books consulted, and if all of this would be consigned to history with the new model of more bureaucratic corporate language that many people see as underpinning this Bill. In the explanatory memorandum, there is extensive reference to economic utility of universities and further and higher education institutions. We need to be clear that we are also talking about much more intangible and less easily quantifiable benefits to our third level sector. The Labour Party had a successful programme in education under former Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach. Nobody knows better than us how the provision of high-quality third level education can usher in economic prosperity. It can raise the standard of living. I remember Ruairí Quinn, as Minister for Education, speaking glowingly about the growth in numbers referenced by the Minister and the enormous benefit to society. We can be so proud of the proportion of our population who now go on to third level or further and higher education. It is really outstanding in Europe. We need to make more of that. It is such a huge benefit to society that so many of our young people now have the opportunity to go to third level. That is important. It is beyond a monetary value. To define education purely in economic terms places in peril courses which are not seen to attract foreign direct investment or which do not neatly fall into the provision of economic benefit to industries which might form our most lucrative exports. Typically, courses in the arts and humanities are seen as less intrinsically or economically valuable in this way, and yet they have enormous benefit to us as a society. It is important to emphasise that. I want to refer to general funding concerns. Again, any debate about governance in higher education must take seriously the issue of funding. The Labour Party welcomes increases in and changes to the SUSI grant scheme for undergraduate and postgraduate students, but we still are anxious to see more done. We are conscious in particular of the extremely high, in many cases impossible, cost of accommodation for students. It costs between €7,000 and €11,000 per annum for accommodation on campus for those lucky enough to get it in UCD and Trinity College. These are exorbitant costs for students. All of us have heard stories of students sharing unsuitable cramped spaces due to unaffordable rents and competing with paid professionals for scarce rental accommodation in cities. Developments designated as so-called student accommodation are often still too costly. Again, this is a crucial issue because this cost on top of the €3,000 annual student contribution charge means students are paying very highly for their education. I have spoken with the Minister previously about the Cassells report and the need for the nettle to be finally grasped with regard to the big question of funding for third level. The Cassells report is now nearly six years old. The Labour Party has called for the key option of State funding to be adopted by the Government rather than either of the other two options set out. The Minister said he is against the loan option, which is a welcome announcement. I do not think anyone could argue in favour of the loan option. It is crucial that we move now to a situation where students do have access to free third level education. We can be very proud of the numbers who go on to third level, but the high cost of accommodation and the €3,000 charge clearly constitute a deeply off-putting deterrent for many. My final comment is in regard to an issue that has been very much topical in universities and third level, namely, the issue of non-disclosure agreements, NDAs. My colleague, Senator Ruane, has conducted a survey on the prevalence of non-disclosure agreements and confidence agreements and her concern that they are being used to suppress the sharing of information about harassment and bullying across third level. I have spoken with constituents in Dublin Bay South and with those I served when I was a Trinity Senator. These people told me of their experience of non-disclosure agreements in different institutions. I will not name any institution. There is a concern that NDAs may protect those who have engaged in unacceptable behaviour. I have submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister on how the HEA will address the practice relating to NDAs, as well as addressing concerns around incidents of bullying and harassment across third level. The Labour Party will support this legislation, but we have concerns about the tone of it and around the need to ensure adequate protection for autonomy of institutions and for academic freedoms within all third level institutions. We believe these are critical points to be considered in our debates on the Bill."	spk_423

Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-01-26	dail	33	Cost of Living: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I am pleased to speak on the Labour Party motion on the cost of living. This is a timely motion, as my colleagues, Deputies Nash and Kelly have pointed out. This is an issue that affects everyone across Ireland today. As we are moving into a new phase of the pandemic and all of us are cautiously optimistic, as we have seen the lifting of most restrictions at the end of last week, nonetheless, what is coming into stark focus now is the reality of increased costs for so many families, individuals and households throughout the country. What we have learnt throughout this pandemic is that the old way of doing politics simply is not good enough any more. We need to ensure we build on those collective values of solidarity that saw us through the toughest times in the pandemic and that we build on what are social democratic and socialist principles of greater roles for the State in intervening to address growing inequalities. I was very struck by the Oxfam figures showing the wealth of Ireland's nine billionaires increased by nearly 60% since March 2020 while for most people wages have stagnated while prices have increased. This is at a time of global insecurity, with Russian troops massing on the border in Ukraine, and consequences that Deputy Nash has spelt out of which we are all very aware in terms of rising prices for energy and serious implications for many in the manufacturing and other sectors throughout the country. I want to focus on two areas in which the Government can make a real difference if it addresses them and takes up the challenge of greater public sector investment in public services and greater and more targeted measures to address them. There are two issues on which people in my constituency in Dublin Bay South and throughout the country are really being squeezed. Childcare is a significant issue given the massive costs. Ireland has the second highest household spend on childcare in the OECD. In my constituency, I hear daily and weekly from couples and individuals who are scrambling to make ends meet and to meet childcare costs, yet we know that across the sector while parents are facing unaffordable fees, staff are being paid at below poverty level in many cases. Many childcare and early years professionals are seeking to leave the sector as they are simply unable to afford to continue to work in it. Crèche and childcare providers are leaving the market and are no longer providing the service because they too are not getting the supports. I have called for a Donogh O'Malley moment where the Government takes up what Labour Women have called for in our equal early years campaign, where we take up the challenge and bring into play a proper, universal, public, community-run childcare system that is affordable for parents and that provides good quality childcare with good supports and recognition for childcare professionals and early years educators. This must be done. We have heard promises of reform from the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, but there has been no delivery and parents still face high fees. Then there is the cost of housing. In my constituency, 44% of all households are in the private rental sector. We are seeing unaffordable hikes in rents and the Government has failed to take action on progressing the Bill that I and Senator Moynihan pioneered and that the Dáil debated in September, which would, among other things, have frozen rents for a three-year period. Our renters' rights Bill would have brought in significant positive reforms for those renting and would have sought to address this serious cost and increase that so many families and individuals are facing. What we want to see with this motion is a better Ireland than we have seen to date. We want to see an Ireland in which the collective principles of solidarity are built upon in which the State takes up the challenge of investment in public services and in which targeted measures are taken by the Government without delay to address rising costs and rising prices and, in particular, to target childcare and rent costs that are crippling so many families.	spk_25
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-01-19	dail	33	Violence Against Women: Statements	dbsect_11	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on behalf of the Labour Party following the horrific killing of Ashling Murphy in Tullamore, County Offaly last week. I begin by expressing my heartfelt sympathies and condolences to Ashling Murphy's family, her partner and friends, and to her community, the school she worked in and all of those who knew her. There has been an immense outpouring of grief nationally at the loss of such a wonderful young woman, with tens of thousands of people attending vigils in Ireland and abroad. Her killing has also generated an immense outpouring not only of grief but of anger at the extent to which all women are subjected to violence or to fear of violence. It has reminded us of so many other horrific killings of women in this country. This Thursday marks one year since the violent attack on Urantsetseg Tserendorj not far from here at the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC. Our thoughts are with her family and friends as we approach that anniversary, and with the families and friends of other women and girls killed so horrifically whose names have been spoken in this Chamber, including Ana Kriégel and Jastine Valdez. Ashling's killing reminds us that, as Women's Aid has reported, 244 women have died violently since 1996, 152 of them killed in their own homes. It has also served to remind us of the extent to which all women and girls are daily subjected to harassment, abuse, violence and assault by men. In recent days we have had an outpouring of women's experiences and stories being recounted. What is perhaps most surprising for me and many of us in this Chamber is the extent to which our good male colleagues have often been unaware of the extent to which we experience everyday sexism and microaggressions. While such violence is only perpetrated by a small number of men, the fear of violence is experienced by all women. All of us who have grown up and live in this culture have become so accustomed to changing our behaviour, assessing risk on a daily basis and modifying our movements all the time because of this fear that we simply do not question it any more. It has become something that is unconscious. We all check ourselves every day. Other colleagues have spoken of the mental checklist we do everywhere we go. We ask if it is safe to walk or cycle down this street, to get into this taxi, to jog in this park or along this canal. This daily checking and the constant need to engage in risk monitoring is instilled in us from an early age. It has taken a horrific killing like that of Ashling Murphy last week to remind us that it is not acceptable that we have put up with this for so long and that we are seeing our teenage daughters also take on this unconscious risk monitoring and fear. I am a mother of teenage daughters. It is simply not acceptable that women and girls in society continue to experience this fear and to engage in this constant checking and risk monitoring. This must be a watershed moment. Many have said that, but we are seeing a growing realisation among men and boys of the need to step up to challenge sexism and the culture in which misogyny and sexism is tolerated and in which men and boys continue to engage in public places in sexist or misogynistic jeering, catcalling, harassment or groping of women and girls. A study today shows that teenage girls have all but stopped cycling in Ireland largely because of a fear of harassment. It is time to engage in a radical culture shift, to adopt a policy of zero tolerance against violence against women and misogyny in all its forms. We know that gender inequality is the common strand which we see worldwide. In my role as chairperson of the Special Committee on Gender Equality established by the Oireachtas just before Christmas, I will be working with colleagues on a cross-party basis to ensure the implementation of important recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly. The assembly made 45 recommendations to tackle gender inequality, five of which refer specifically to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Here is what we need to do to build on those recommendations urgently. First, we need a Cabinet Minister, and I am pleased the Minister for Justice is going to take the lead in co-ordinating and implementing all strategies to prevent and counter violence against women. The Minister must urgently publish the promised strategy on gender-based violence. I know she has committed to doing so. She must also expedite the publication of the data we so badly need to build on the sexual abuse and violence in Ireland, SAVI, data from 2002. In parallel with that, we must also see the rolling out of a public awareness campaign focused on prevention and education for children in all schools through the relationships and sexuality education, RSE, programme – with no opt-outs for schools, whatever their ethos. We also need a parallel public awareness programme for adults to challenge misogyny and sexism in all its forms. In addition to that, we need to see the implementation of the criminal justice reforms recommended in the O'Malley report and committed to by the Department of Justice in Supporting a Victim's Journey. Two issues that jump out from the O'Malley report are the fragmentation of services for victims across the country and the lack of a voice for victims in the courtroom. We need to see really serious work on that in the coming months and ensure there is legislation to increase the level of representation for the victim in the courtroom and that addresses the real fragmentation of services and the inadequate supports in particular for victims of domestic violence and the lack of sheltered provision. We know we still fall short of the requirements in the Istanbul Convention. We need a fundamental change of emphasis to address not only the flaws in the criminal justice system, to build on the positive changes we have made such as Coco's Law and the introduction of the offence of coercive control and the definition of consent. We need legislation to tackle the existing gaps in the system but, in particular, we need to focus on the education and the cultural change. We need to recognise that given the gender imbalance in this House, where less than a quarter of us are women, that we must ask male colleagues to be aware of the unconscious bias that persists through our system and the chilling effect on women and girls of sexism, misogyny, mansplaining, sexist comments, exclusion and the other microaggressions that far too many women and girls continue to endure day in and day out. It falls to all of us, women and men, in this House and beyond, to take a stand against sexism and to take responsibility for ensuring that ours is a safe and equal country for all women and girls in which we stand up to sexism and misogyny in all its forms.	spk_159
Ivana Bacik	54	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2022-01-19	dail	33	Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_12	"I am glad to speak for the Labour Party on this important Bill and to speak not only as the Labour spokesperson on children but also as a member of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. I welcome the fact we are debating the Bill. I acknowledge that we had all hoped that today would be a landmark day for the rights of adopted persons to access information, to access birth information and to access their identity rights. I absolutely appreciate the Minister’s commitment to ensuring that and the fact significant progress is being made in the Bill. I share Deputy Kathleen Funchion’s reservations about aspects of the Bill, however. In particular, I share her disappointment that some critical recommendations of our committee in its pre-legislative scrutiny report have not been included in the Bill. I pay tribute to Deputy Funchion, who steered and chaired our lengthy deliberations at pre-legislative scrutiny stage. As she stated, the 83 recommendations we came up with were based on the extensive hearings conducted. I joined the committee having been conscious that there had already been quite extensive consultation, but I participated following my election in July in more extensive hearings. We heard from many stakeholders.We engaged closely in respect of the draft heads and we believed our recommendations to be robust. I appreciate that the Minister has accepted some of the recommendations, but I want to address three critical ways in which they were not addressed in this Bill. It is in the context of those recommendations in particular that many of us on the committee will be disappointed. Many of those who received our recommendations, including stakeholders who appreciated the recommendations, share that disappointment. First is the critical issue of access to information. Will this access be unrestricted as was promised and as people had hoped or will it be conditional? On this side of the House, we are all disappointed that the access remains conditional. It is a great step forward from what was previously provided for in other iterations of this legislation but there is still the condition of a mandatory information session. Why can we not get beyond this? It was helpful of the Minister to set out the long history over many decades of this State grappling with how to provide for information rights for adopted persons. The one thing he did not say was that in the recent past there were attempts by the Opposition, including my party, to bring forward legislation earlier. In 2020, we brought forward the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill, which would have inserted a new section 86 into the Adoption Act 2010. That would have been a simple mechanism to unlock the information necessary to enable adopted persons to access their birth certificates upon turning 18 by making traceable the connection between an entry in the adopted children register and the corresponding entry in the register of births. Other Opposition parties produced similar legislation that provided for simple unlocking mechanisms without cumbersome restrictions being placed on access. It is clear, not just from the history the Minister outlined but also from the Opposition attempts to legislate on this matter, that there is a clear cross-party intent in the Oireachtas to ensure an unfettered right of identity and information is provided to adopted persons. I pay tribute to the many individuals and advocacy groups, such as the Adoption Rights Alliance and the Clann Project, which also sought to do this, helped us with this and gave evidence before the committee. We also looked at legislation in neighbouring jurisdictions and we looked at other European countries. We are conscious that anyone in Northern Ireland aged 18 or over has had the right to a copy of his or her original birth certificate since 1987. In other jurisdictions, that right extends back much farther. In the provisions we have been presented with in this new Bill, however, we are still seeing the retention of a conditional right of access. I worked closely with the Minister’s predecessor, Katherine Zappone, on trying to ensure that there would be a right of access to information. We constantly heard, both in briefings with Ms Zappone and on the floor of this House and the Seanad, that this right had to be balanced with the right to privacy of mothers. We were also told that the right to information could not be provided for in an unconditional way. We examined this closely in the committee. I looked at what we said at the committee again today. We made the point that on the basis of the evidence we had heard and on the expertise of those who appeared before us, the constitutional balancing could be addressed in other ways and it would not be necessary to provide a mandatory information session. We said clearly that the inclusion of a mandatory information session for persons who had registered a preference for no contact would still mean that adopted people whose parents had registered this preference would be: “singled out for different treatment and a targeted warning about privacy rights.” This was seen by some witnesses as compounding misguided fears about adopted people and perpetuating injustice. We proposed an alternative. We said that an appropriate and clear alternative would be to send the correspondence and information about the no contact preference by registered post. This was a way of ensuring a balance in the rights, along with the other measures. As the Minister stated, there were other measures in the Bill to safeguard the privacy rights of mothers, namely, the age limit of 16 or over, the counselling provision and the measure to provide information in some way. The big question for any of us who have engaged with the process of pre-legislative scrutiny is why we are seeing the retention of this mandatory information session. Looking at the wording of the sections in the Bill and one can see that it is a mandatory information session; there is no other way to describe it. Looking at section 7, which states that in the case of a no contact registration the recipient body shall comply: “only where it has received a notification ... of the completion of an information session”. What is that information session to comprise? Section 17 clearly sets out what the information session will be and it is still referred to as an “information session”. It is referred to as a section which is, “a session held between the relevant person and a designated person, [and we know that is an employee of Tusla or the adoption authority] at which the designated person informs the relevant person of” his or her entitlement to get the birth certificate or information. The section mentions the fact that the parent has stated that he or she is not willing to be contacted and crucially, the importance of the relevant person respecting the privacy rights and preference of the parent. Why does that have to be imparted during an information session? Why can that information not be imparted through an easier mechanism such as the sending of registered post? That could include the back-up measure of counselling or supportive meetings where desired by the adopted person. Why could we not have seen an alternative mechanism put in place rather than this targeted warning session? We all accept that it no longer needs to be held in person and that it can be done by way of phone call or virtual call and that is a welcome change. From the perspective of the people who are contacting us, including adopted persons, mothers and other stakeholders, it is still seen as a paternalistic approach and as representing a condition upon access that is not desired or welcomed by adopted persons. We have seen some disheartened and disappointed language from those who have contacted us, some saying they feel it is offensive that our laws will still require the information session. They feel it is unnecessary to explain to them in this verbal fashion that they must respect the will of the woman who gave birth to them when this much is already patently clear. We are hearing real disappointment, disheartenment and frustration at what appears to be a grudging step forward rather than the big step we all hoped we would see in this legislation. I ask the Minister to look again at our report, particularly pages 23 and 24, where we clearly set out our rationale for moving away from a mandatory information session. I know I have spent some time on this, but perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the Bill is to see that measure retained and to see the language that is still being used in section 17. Again, I speak with a heavy heart. I thought we had moved beyond this and that the arguments we had heard over the years about the balancing of rights should be taken in a different context in 2022. We should be able to build on the experiences we have had and the different iterations, which the Minister has clearly outlined, that we have seen over the years in attempts to legislate on this. We should no longer need to see this sort of mandatory condition. What happens if an adopted person refuses to take the call? That person will then not have access to the information. This Bill does not provide, as we had all hoped and expected it would, for a release of information in all cases and that is the disappointment that is felt. I know others will be bringing amendments and Labour will be bringing amendments on this. We will be looking to implement the recommendations of the cross-party committee, which was specifically charged with undertaking this pre-legislative scrutiny. This is the important point and there will be a great deal of debate on Committee Stage on the provisions around this information session, particularly on section 17 and the related sections 7 to 10, inclusive. I also want to address the issue of illegal adoptions and incorrect birth registration information. Again, the committee addressed this in recommendations 10 and 11 of our report, where we specifically looked at the definition.The committee recommended that a change be made. In its view, having heard extensively from those affected, the definition of incorrect birth registration was somewhat sanitised and should be amended to read ""falsely or incorrectly recorded"" instead. The concern was that this seemed to reflect a recording of incorrect information that was carried out in error whereas we know from extensive testimony over the years that there were false registrations of births and that this was done deliberately and not just in error. The committee members believed, having heard from many of those affected, that this should be recognised in the legislation or in the explanatory memorandum. The committee suggested that the text in the explanatory memorandum should refer to ""illegal or unlawful adoption"" to clarify that the procedures for rectifying the register, which are very welcome, would apply both to those whose particulars were deliberately falsified and those whose particulars were merely incorrectly recorded. The Minister will probably move to reassure the House that the procedures for remedying the register will apply to false records as well as those simply incorrectly recorded in error. I anticipate that and see the Minister nodding but I reiterate the need to reflect the lived experiences of those who were illegally adopted. I welcome sections 52 and 53 in particular, which address the issue of illegal adoption. We are all conscious of the serious difficulties that so many adoptees have had due to false registration. I want to pay tribute to former Deputy Joan Burton, who spoke so eloquently on ""Sunday with Miriam"" last weekend about her own experience as an adopted person. She has been such a champion of adopted persons and their right to information and she really took forward the case of those who had been illegally adopted. In 2019, she and I published legislation seeking to deal with this after the revelations of over 100 illegal registrations of births and adoptions at St. Patrick's Guild. I also want to pay tribute to those who took the time to give their own public testimony of their experiences in the documentary aired by RTÉ in March 2021, ""Who Am I? - The story of Ireland's illegal adoptions"", which was so powerful. The contributors to that programme spoke about their experience of discovering, in many cases many decades later, that they had been illegally adopted and the trauma and anguish that caused them. One contributor very strikingly said that they felt their life was built on a lie they had been told. It is really welcome to see this legislation addressing their situation but when one hears that powerful testimony, it makes it all the more important that the reality of their situation is recognised. These were deliberately falsified records in some cases and not just clerical errors but the language in the Bill does not adequately reflect that. That is what the committee found also. Finally, in terms of the committee recommendations, I want to address a crucial recommendation which comes up a number of times in the report, namely, recommendation No. 73. This reflects an issue we had with the Bill more generally and which comes up in relation to a number of different issues in the Bill, that is, the lack of an oversight or an appeals mechanism. In recommendation No. 73, the committee called for the establishment in the Bill of an oversight process or accessible appeals mechanism. Specifically, the committee argued that the Bill should provide ""for recourse to an Ombudsperson or other process to ensure oversight of the application process, support for adopted persons and others in using the Bill's provisions, and an accessible and effective appeal mechanism"". On page 51 of the report, the committee outlined its rationale for this but it comes up in a number of instances in the pre-legislative scrutiny. Regarding head 13 of the Bill, for example, the committee said that this enabled Tusla or the Adoption Authority to make a request to a third party for information needed to assist in the process of tracing but this is lacking an enforcement mechanism or some oversight. I will have to check to see if that has been addressed in the Bill but more generally, what appears to be lacking in the Bill is a more general oversight mechanism or appeals process. Again, I am coming back to the mandatory information session, which is so contentious. What happens, I ask again, if the adopted person says ""I do not want to partake of a phone call"" or ""I do not want take this call""? Is there any appeal mechanism? What is the next step in the process then? Is there a next step or are we simply assuming there will not be a need for one? The committee had a concern about the fact that the Bill is lacking a clear outline for adopted persons and others of where they go next if the primary processes set out in the Bill have failed them in some way. I hope the Minister will take this commentary as a constructive criticism. What I wanted to do was outline three areas where the committee has made some very robust and clear recommendations that would have greatly improved the Bill. It is unfortunate to see they are lacking. As I said, there is much to welcome in the Bill. All of us will acknowledge that we are very pleased to see it coming before the House at this stage, so quickly in this Government's term, albeit so long overdue given the long processes that have gone before. We are all conscious of the history of the stigma which prevailed for so long that allowed for the incarceration of women and children and which has defined, for far too long, our national approach to adoption. The primary legislation, the Adoption Act 1952, enshrined a secret and closed adoption system and as a result, we have developed a secretive system. In the words of a former chairperson of the Adoption Board, Ms Vivienne Darling, this ensured that ""adoptees were kept in the dark as to their origins"" for far too long. I want to acknowledge the Minister's own commitment to ensuring that adoptees are finally brought into the light in being enabled to access birth information but he will also appreciate the frustration many of us feel when we still see some form of condition being placed on access to that information.  I have spoken before about my experience of representing many survivors of abuse in industrial schools and other institutions over the years and of hearing from them the really harrowing experience not only of being incarcerated and abused in many cases but also of being failed by a State that simply did not provide any safeguards for children in their situation. There is still a feeling among many of those who went through experiences like that as children, who were adopted, that they have been failed by the State. We need to make sure that we are stepping up and are seen to be really addressing the needs of adopted persons in particular, but also of mothers who were also failed by the State, particularly those who were incarcerated in mother and baby homes.  The Labour Party has called for a full public inquiry into adoption practices in the State, to investigate the scale of illegal adoption because we are still not clear about the scale of it. We need to give more scrutiny to that practice, which has been left in the dark for so long. We must also reflect on the ways in which we are still failing women and children in particular. Earlier tonight we debated violence against women and discussed the failure to provide adequate shelter for domestic violence survivors, for example. These are all issues which are very much intertwined. It is great to see legislation that will go some way towards meeting the real needs of adopted persons, their real need for information as to their identity and their need to access their birth certificates. Let us work together constructively on Committee and Report Stages to ensure that the Bill can be amended and can really provide for that full information right, that full right of access to identity that all of us want to see finally enshrined in our law."	spk_199
Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-12-16	dail	33	Proceeds of Crime (Gross Human Rights Abuses) Bill 2020: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_42	I am very happy with that and I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle making that suggestion. I am delighted to speak for the Labour Party and to support my colleague, Deputy Howlin’s brilliant initiative in bringing forward this Magnitsky Bill to tackle human rights abuses and to ensure that, as the Deputy said, those guilty of perpetrating human rights abuses will not have a safe haven in Ireland for their ill-gotten funds. We must also ensure that we have the necessary criminal justice infrastructure in place to deal with this and to allow for the seizure of assets of human rights violators. I am proud to be here to support this Bill and to speak in favour of it. It is an issue that is close to my heart. This legislation deals with money laundering as a worldwide crime and with the aftermath of issues in kleptocracies where regimes have robbed their people of their assets, raw materials and resources. The immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union was a case in point and the case that prompted the initial momentum around Magnitsky legislation. As Deputy Howlin said, since 2012 we have seen laws known as Magnitsky laws passed in a number of jurisdictions that provide for financial sanctions against the officials of other states who have committed human rights abuses or who have been involved in significant corruption. These laws are named after Sergei Magnitsky. He was an accountant who died in a Moscow prison after investigating a $230 million fraud involving Russian tax officials. While in prison, Magnitsky was refused medical treatment and after almost a year he was allegedly beaten to death while in custody. His friends publicised the case and lobbied American officials to pass legislation sanctioning Russian officials involved and engaged in corruption. Magnitsky’s tragic death is what prompted the passage of legislation and the international movement. Many colleagues in this House and in the Seanad will be well aware of the Magnitsky case, particularly because it has been publicised so remarkably well across the world by Bill Browder, the American-born businessman who has published on the issue and whose book  Since 2021 a number of jurisdictions have passed legislation on this, including the US in 2012, Britain, Canada, Lithuania and Latvia. The case for such legislation was strengthened in the last year, particularly in light of protests over the treatment of Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition politician. The Minister of State will recall that in the other House, when I was a Member of the Seanad, in our debate on the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Act 2021 on 1 February I spoke with him about the prospect of bringing in Magnitsky legislation and I raised the case of Alexei Navalny. The Minister of State told me then that the Department was seriously considering Deputy Howlin’s proposal and the Labour Party Bill and would facilitate it. I am grateful to the Minister of State, as I know Deputy Howlin is, for his constructive engagement on the matter and for the fact that the Government is supporting the Bill to go through Second Stage. That is constructive and it is appropriate that the House would not divide on this. There is clearly a consensus across the House on the need for this type of legislation. Deputy Howlin pointed out that we are increasingly seeing across the world that those who are taking up the mantle of the defence of human rights are coming under attack for their work. I have been proud to work with Front Line Defenders for many years. It is an NGO that works globally to recognise the work, bravery and courage of so many human rights defenders in different regimes. We will all have serious concerns about the abuses we are seeing and about the need to pass legislation here to strengthen the framework in Ireland that enables us to deal with this abuse. I am conscious that just as we talked about this in February when Alexei Navalny’s case was in the news, so too we are talking about this Bill today as we see a build-up of the Russian military on the border with Ukraine. We see growing concerns about the potential for human rights abuses there and for serious conflict with Ukraine. I know that is a matter that is being dealt with at a high level in the EU this week. It is in that context that we are bringing forward this legislation. Deputy Howlin has set out the nature of the Bill and clearly there are powers under the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 to 2016, as he said, to seize and dispose of assets. These powers may be available against corrupt foreign officials who have assets within this jurisdiction but the difficulty is that dual criminality test that would need to be satisfied. The purpose of this Bill, therefore, is to make the existing legislation more easily available and capable of dealing with such cases so that certain conduct occurring outside of our State will be described as criminal conduct for the purposes of our proceeds of crime legislation, notwithstanding that it does not constitute an offence under the law of the foreign state concerned. We see this as in keeping with other progressive legislation being passed in other countries around the world and we are also conscious of the initiative of the European Parliament to encourage all EU states to take up the same cause and to pass legislation mirroring this sort of Magnitsky law. This will ensure that foreign governments or officials involved in corrupt practices or gross violations of human rights, if they have assets in this State or in other EU states, will have to face the rigours of the law in those states. It is a huge issue when we look at the amassing of assets that corrupt officials have done in other countries, particularly in EU member states but also in countries like Switzerland. We need to ensure, therefore, that Ireland does not become that sort of safe haven and that we have the necessary tools and infrastructure in place in our criminal justice system to deal with this issue. I commend Deputy Howlin on bringing the Bill forward. I thank the Minister of State on behalf of the Labour Party for his constructive engagement on this and I look forward to the swift passage of this Bill in the memory of Sergei Magnitsky. I recognise the immense work done on this by Bill Browder and so many others.	spk_307
Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-12-15	dail	33	Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) (Foetal Pain Relief) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I am glad to contribute on behalf of the Labour Party and to set out why we cannot support this Bill. We will support the Government amendment. There is no care or compassion for women's health conveyed throughout the Bill, nor would it do anything to enhance or improve the health of women or our access to reproductive healthcare. As previous speakers have said, language matters in this debate. It is very important that we all speak on issues relating to women's reproductive health, abortion and crisis pregnancies with compassion, empathy and understanding for the many women in this country who face the awful prospect of a crisis pregnancy and who are faced with considerations and choices to make. We have to be conscious that for far too long in our very recent history, the language of foetal rights and that of the life of the unborn was used to devalue the lives and the health of pregnant women.It was used in such a way as we saw in 1983 with the eighth amendment to the Constitution and the consequent litigation on that. We saw terrible consequences for the health and lives of pregnant women. Until the repeal of the eighth amendment in 2018, our fundamental law and Constitution placed undue priority upon the protection of foetal life, placing the right to life of the pregnant woman and the foetus in direct conflict with the appalling consequences that are well known and have been well documented. We might recall the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar in 2012 and the dreadful case of PP in 2014 in which a pregnant woman was kept alive on life support against her family’s wishes and against the clinical judgment of her medical team because of the eighth amendment. We might recall the women who took their cases to the European Court of Human Rights, known as A, B and C, and the women like Amanda Mellet and Siobhán Whelan who took their cases before the United Nations. We might also remember the many more women, whose stories are untold but all of whom suffered under the eighth amendment and the approximately 160,000 women who were forced to travel abroad, often in dire circumstances, to access terminations of pregnancy, in many cases placing their health at risk. It was the recognition of that reality and of the real consequence of the eighth amendment, including that undue priority that was placed on foetal life that caused the Irish people to vote by a 66.4% majority in 2018 to delete the text that equated the right to life of the foetus with that of the pregnant woman from the Constitution. We should not forget that the referendum followed extensive debate on measures such as those proposed in this Private Members’ Bill, as well as extensive consultation through the Citizens’ Assembly process and the Oireachtas committee process. We might recall that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution recommended repeal for three key reasons. It did so because of the impact the amendment had on the provision of services for pregnant women; the continuing and ongoing breach of Ireland’s international human rights obligations; and the practical reality of thousands of women being forced to travel every year or to import the abortion pill. It was those considerations and the compassion and empathy for women in crisis pregnancy that brought about the holding of the referendum in 2018 and that remarkable result in repealing it by such a strong and clear majority. That majority voted in clear knowledge that the legislation which had previously been published would provide for legal abortion in Ireland consequently. This was progress and a huge step forward for the rights of women and girls. None of us in this House really wants to go back to those days pre-2018 when those of us who had daughters – and I have two – would face the prospect of those girls growing up under the chill of the eighth amendment, as so many of us did. I speak as somebody who was taken to court 32 years ago and threatened with prison for giving information to women in crisis pregnancy in my role as president of the Trinity College Students' Union. I will never forget the calls we got in the students union every day and every week in those dark years of 1989 and 1990 from women and girls in crisis pregnancy who were desperate to get the phone number of a clinic in England because they felt they had no choice but to terminate their pregnancies and we failed them in this State for far too long, for the 35 years the eighth amendment was in place. Let us not go back to those dark days. I am proud of the role the Labour Party played during those years; of the role my party played in the repeal campaign; and of my party as a pro-choice party. The activists of Labour Women and of the party were at the forefront of the repeal campaign. We are supporting the Government amendment and we want to work constructively with the Minister and the Government on the statutory review process that we are glad to see under way. We have been critical of the apparent narrowness of the terms of reference and I note the concerns expressed today by the National Women’s Council of Ireland on the terms of reference. We want to ensure that reforms will be introduced on foot of the experiential survey the Minister is conducting and I am glad to hear that Dr. Catherine Conlon of Trinity College Dublin will be leading the study into women’s experiences. They must be at the heart of the review. I am also glad that we will see the experiences of service providers and of the operation of the Act in the survey. It is also important that we look at policy recommendations and changes to enhance and strengthen women’s rights of access. In particular we want to see the lifting of the three-day waiting period, which does not have any medical basis and again the National Women’s’ Council of Ireland has made that point today. We want to see the introduction of a safe access zone law to protect from intimidation women who seek to access terminations. Again today I see Together for Safety noting that there are still ongoing intimidatory protests around our maternity hospitals. We are concerned that there are women in this country who, because of geographic differences in services cannot access terminations of pregnancies here and who have to travel still. We know that 375 women had to travel to England in 2020, compounding the crisis of the pregnancies they faced in many cases. We want to make sure we can deliver the reproductive health services we so clearly need to women in this country. For far too long those services were denied to us under that chill of the eighth amendment. Let us not take so long about the review this time either. Let us not take as long as it took us to repeal the eighth amendment. If I had known as a 21-year old activist that it would take over three decades to repeal the eighth amendment and to deliver healthcare to women in this country I do not know what I would have done. It was such a relief to so many of us of my generation to see the eighth amendment finally repealed in 2018. We do not want to go back. We want to ensure we move forward, build on the services that are available and build on the legislative provisions clearly set out in the 2018 Act. We want to ensure our clinical guidelines deliver doctors and medical professionals the guidance they need to ensure the Act is implemented with compassion, empathy and care for women who are pregnant, who are facing crisis pregnancy and who require terminations of pregnancy. That is the clear pathway forward that my party wants to see and I believe the clear majority of people in Ireland want to see that, as represented by that tremendous vote in 2018. Let us not go back and let us ensure that none of our daughters or granddaughters has to live under the chill of the eighth amendment or endure the sort of terrible consequences that so many women endured in this country for far too long.	spk_30
Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-12-15	dail	33	Animal Health and Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021: Instruction to Committee	dbsect_14	The Labour Party is serious about taking measures to tackle the climate crisis and ensuring we meet our ambitious but necessary targets on climate. As such, we welcome any proposals to increase tree planting and afforestation, particularly native tree planting and woodland cover. We see that increase in forest cover as an essential component of actions to meet our climate targets, especially given that Ireland's forest cover is among the lowest of any county in the EU. I understand the figure is 11%, compared with an EU average of more than one third. Sadly, just under 2%, or approximately 20,000 ha of that 11% is native woodland, of which only tiny fragments are original ancient forests, which covered 80% of this island just after the most recent ice age. It is in this context that we are willing to support the motion but we have concerns about the process. It is unfortunate that it is coming to us at such a late stage and in connection with completely different legislation. It is not good legislative practice, particularly in the last sitting week before Christmas, to see a motion brought forward in this way, with so little advance consultation. Many of us have been alerted to the concerns raised by the Social, Economic, Environmental Forestry Association, SEEFA, about the process by which this is being introduced. There are valid concerns around the process. Having said that, I agree that we need to take urgent action to ensure we meet targets, particularly on afforestation. I welcome today's publication of the detailed annexe to the climate action plan, which is something I have sought in this House on a number of occasions over recent months, particularly since the publication of the plan. We are all very conscious, and even the Government would acknowledge, that the plan was big on aspirations but lacked the detailed timelines on delivery of necessary actions. It lacked the level of detail that could only be supplied in a more detailed annexe. It is welcome to see that produced today. When I raised this with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, in the House last week, I had a suspicion that it might not be published until after the Dáil had risen. Instead, it has been published on the second-last day of the Dáil term, which is not ideal. It is unfortunate that we will not have an opportunity to debate the annexe in full before the House rises. Even on a preliminary look at the document and the timelines provided, there are disappointments, including in respect of bringing in regulations on e-scooters and e-bikes. There are some very welcome measures on the transport side to increase cycling infrastructure, active travel and public transport provision, but we are seeing many delays and a lagging behind. There certainly is not the necessary sense of urgency we had hoped for in the annexe. I hope we have an opportunity early in the new year to debate more fully the annexe, the afforestation targets and other targets set out within it and the associated timelines. I certainly will be looking for that debate through the Business Committee. Turning to the motion, we all have concerns about the licensing backlog. Indeed, I raised it in the House on 9 December when I asked the Minister about the number of afforestation licences issued, on which we had an engagement and debate. Many colleagues, on both sides of the House, shared my concern about that backlog and the delays in the delivery of ambitious projects such as Project Woodland, welcome though it is. The Minister acknowledged last week that what has been lacking to date in the forestry sector is a co-ordinated and joined-up afforestation policy that fits within the climate action plan and helps to deliver the necessary climate action targets. In that context, we should all be concerned not only about low levels of native woodland cover, as I mentioned, but also that we continue to cut down more trees than we are planting. For every acre of forestry that is planted, approximately 6.7 acres are cut down. That needs to change if we are to meet our ambitious but necessary targets. I raise these concerns and reservations in the context of supporting the motion.	spk_124

The Minister of State also acknowledged that there are still many issues to fix. We are hearing concerns about delays and bureaucratic obstacles, such as applicants being asked for Natura impact statements even though they have already proposed forestry plans. It is welcome to hear that more ecologists have been appointed, but there is still a concern about whether we will meet targets. The Minister of State referred to Project Woodland. I would like to know more about the nature of the forestry licences that are issued and how that impacts on the biodiversity crisis we are facing along with the climate crisis. Will the preponderance be native woodland and native tree species? Will there be an emphasis on that rather than the emphasis we have seen for far too long on commercial species?	spk_11

We are cutting down more trees than we are planting. We are felling more trees and granting more licences to fell than we are granting licences to plant. Indeed, Deputy Sherlock told me that for every acre of forestry we plant, we are cutting approximately 6.7 acres, so that has to change if we are to meet those targets.	spk_13

Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-12-08	dail	33	Offshore Renewable Energy: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I am glad to speak for the Labour Party in support of the motion. I commend the Regional Group on tabling it and I am glad the Government is accepting it. It is important that we have cross-party support on this important issue of the development of offshore renewables. All Members are conscious that Ireland is facing three specific crises in the context of energy and energy supply, the first of which is the rising cost of energy bills. All present are conscious that the average household is facing significantly increased costs as all 14 energy suppliers have increased prices at least once this year and in September the Commission for Regulation of Utilities warned there will be higher charges due to record demand and reduced supply. We have real concerns regarding fuel poverty for many households in winter. Second, there is a concern and crisis building in respect of security and certainty in energy supply. In response to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, in recent weeks, we learned that there have been seven amber systems alerts in the past 12 months. The third, and most existential, crisis is the urgent need to decarbonise energy and avoid a devastating rise in global temperatures due to the climate emergency in the next decade and beyond. We know that in order to address these crises we need to develop significantly our capacity for offshore wind generation. All Members will have seen the report of Wind Energy Ireland - I am grateful to it for supplying the briefing - setting out its concerns that we are not currently on track to reach our renewable energy targets through offshore wind generation. We know that by 2030 we must increase our generation of electricity from renewable sources from 30% to at least 70% or 80% and bring about a 30% reduction in CO2 emissions and a 32.5% improvement in energy efficiency. All Members are conscious that a robust, fair and transparent framework for offshore renewables must form part of this puzzle. Indeed, we need to see greatly enhanced grid capacity. Wind Energy Ireland states that we need a stronger grid and to develop further our delivery of onshore wind capacity in order to meet renewable targets. However, we still lack the detailed annexe and timeline that was promised when the climate action plan was published several weeks ago. I and my party welcomed the ambitious but necessary targets in the climate action plan. We want to work constructively to ensure those targets are reached but we are concerned that without that detailed annexe, we simply do not have the necessary level of information to see how we are going to reach those targets and what are the steps to be taken in the next few months, the next year and the next decade to reach those targets. I note the Climate Change Advisory Council today published a very critical review of the approach of the Government to reaching those targets, with Marie Donnelly pointing out a time lag in implementation, gaps between ambition and practical implementation and, in particular, referring to the absence of publication of that detailed annexe and timeline that I have previously asked about in the House. I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, who is present, about it, as well as the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. We really need to see that detail. The situation is the same in the context of offshore wind capacity. Anyone who had the pleasure of flying into Copenhagen airport pre-Covid will have seen the mass of offshore wind turbines there. It is no surprise that Denmark is leading the way on offshore renewables. Ireland does not yet have anything like that capacity or infrastructure or the investment necessary to develop that infrastructure to increase our offshore wind generation in the way we need. We know that demand for electricity will increase as we increasingly electrify transport and all our other amenities, so we need to move much more urgently on offshore wind. We are having this debate not only in the context of the critical review from the Climate Change Advisory Council, but also the repeated warnings from Mark Foley, chief executive of EirGrid, regarding the challenges in meeting our targets and, of course, the announcement of the withdrawal of Equinor from Ireland in recent weeks. Although all present know the establishment of the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, will be a significant step in the creation of a better planning and infrastructure building system for offshore development, we need to see more urgency. I was glad to hear the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, outlining a timeline for establishing the option processes for renewables and I note that he stated he hopes the first option will take place in the final quarter of next year, but we need to see much more urgency on all of these developments. Other speakers have referred to the Ardnacrusha scheme and the significant ambition and dynamism in respect of the construction of that hydroelectric scheme approximately 100 years ago. This month, we are marking the centenary of the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, but we should also be marking and celebrating the development of Ardnacrusha and channelling that focus and energy into building very quickly the green energy infrastructure we need, including offshore wind energy infrastructure. The motion before the House sets out some very important points on how we can do that.  I refer to the need to focus on other renewables. The motion addresses that issue too. I have tabled parliamentary questions on the issue of green hydrogen, seeking to explore precisely what initiatives we can take in Ireland to ensure the roll-out of green hydrogen in a way that is cost-effective, being cognisant that cost of production is currently a significant obstacle to this going forward. I understand the issue is to be discussed at the European Council of energy ministers later this month. I hope the Government will be proactive in promoting this alternative and I look forward to getting an update after that meeting has taken place. On the issue of solar, I, like many other Deputies, have received many queries from constituents in Dublin Bay South requesting an update on the Government's microgeneration scheme and the potential for installing solar panels. These queries are from individuals, households, schools, sports clubs and others that are keen to do this. We are seeing significant public buy-in on this, just as we are seeing significant public buy-in on moving to electric vehicles, EVs. However, in this case, too, the infrastructure is not in place. It is really difficult to get publicly accessible EV charging facilities. We are still awaiting Dublin City Council's plan on this. It is very frustrating when I am being asked why we cannot simply have more public access EV chargers. The situation is similar for those seeking to install solar panels. I have tabled parliamentary questions on why we have not seen new regulations and exemptions for schools seeking to install such panels, for example. I am glad to hear these new regulations are due for publication early next year but people are keen to move now on this microgeneration, which has significant potential for community buy-in.  As regards energy storage, in October I asked the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, his position in respect of the storage of electricity generated from renewables. I am glad to see the programme for Government contains a commitment to incentivise electricity storage. It is mentioned in the climate action plan but, again, we need more detail. Finally, I refer to the biodiversity emergency we are facing. We must be conscious that when we are developing offshore infrastructure, we are not doing so at a cost to marine biodiversity. Yesterday in the House I launched the Dublin Bay Bill, which would provide for a new statutory authority to promote and enhance environmental protection in Dublin Bay. That initiative is crucial in the context of rolling out offshore wind energy generation and anticipating the forthcoming policy statement on port infrastructure necessary to develop offshore wind capacity.  The Labour Party welcomes the motion and the opportunity to debate this very important issue, but we are anxiously awaiting and seeking much more urgent and detailed implementation plans from the Government on offshore wind generation and all these other necessary measures to reach our climate targets.	spk_33
Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-12-07	dail	33	Dublin Bay Bill 2021: First Stage	dbsect_6	"I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to establish a special committee of the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly to serve as a Dublin Bay Authority; to provide as an objective for the Authority the preservation for current and future generations of the distinctive character of Dublin Bay and its ecology as a coastal resource; to confer on the Authority the function of proposing and promoting policies and priorities for the protection and enhancement of the environment, and in particular the water quality, of Dublin Bay and of its natural habitats and wildlife; and to provide for connected matters.I am introducing this Labour Bill in order to promote a radical new vision for the protection and enhancement of the wonderful natural amenity on our doorstep that is Dublin Bay. If my Bill is passed, it would establish a statutory Dublin Bay authority charged with preserving for future generations the distinctive character of Dublin Bay and its ecology as a coastal resource. The authority would have the aim of creating a better framework for environmental protection, governance and improvement of water quality for all of those who use the bay. The idea is that the authority will create and strengthen a better framework for the protection of one of the great resources that our city has. Indeed, it is one of the greatest resources that all of us in Dublin have, not just those in my constituency of Dublin Bay South. All of us in Dublin have strong connections to the body of water stretching from Howth to Sorrento Point. We have strong connections to the bay. It is often the first thing we see when we fly into Dublin when coming home. It welcomes us, it is where many of us learned to swim, sail or paddle and, of course, it is the location for the opening chapter of our greatest novel,  I am proud to have worked with a number of people on this Bill, particularly our local councillors in Dublin Bay South, Mr. Dermot Lacey, Ms Mary Freehill and Mr. Kevin Donoghue. Councillor Lacey in particular has been calling for a model like this for some time. I have also worked with swimmers from the Half Moon club in Poolbeg and a group that was formed in 2020 arising out of concerns about water quality in the bay, namely, SOS Dublin Bay. As many colleagues will be aware, the latter's ""Save Our Sea"" petition has more than 20,000 signatories. Since the start of the terrible pandemic and throughout the various Covid lockdowns, we know how much the bay has become a place of refuge for year-round and seasonal sea swimmers. All too often, though, water quality has been poor and swimming has consequently been under threat in the bay. Biodiversity in the bay, including marine life, is under threat as a result. We want to establish a statutory authority with a specific mandate to propose and promote policies and priorities for the protection and enhancement of the environment, natural habitats and wildlife and to ensure proper monitoring and regulation of sea water quality.The membership of the authority would come from among elected members of the Eastern and Midlands Regional Assembly and others with a special expertise or interest in the future protection of Dublin Bay. While environmental protection will be a key requirement of the new authority, it would also have a mandate to improve access and facilities around Dublin Bay. We are conscious that there is an informal task force which has some responsibilities around Dublin Bay but which has no statutory powers. As a result, there is a lack of co-ordination for the protection and enhancement of this wonderful amenity. For decades we have witnessed the crumbling dereliction of the old Sandymount and Blackrock baths and a lack of facilities for those who would like to be able to use the sea and the bay in a more meaningful manner. We might even see a lido with public access for all swimmers in George's Dock if we establish a new authority with statutory powers that this Bill anticipates and envisages. Such a statutory model works elsewhere. For example, on the east coast of the US, a statutory task force was established some years ago for Chesapeake Bay to preserve the future of the bay, improve water standards and encourage greater use of the bay by local people. That is the sort of community facility we want to see established in and around Dublin Bay. That is why this Bill is so important. At the end of October, I asked a question of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on water quality in Dublin Bay. I was seeking to ensure a better system for monitoring water quality for all of us who swim in the bay throughout the year. On the floor of the House, the Minister disclosed that he, a regular sea swimmer as am I, had recently had an ear infection and wondered if it might be connected to the quality of water in the bay. I have never, to my knowledge, become sick as a result of poor water quality in the bay, but this is a real concern for many others with whom I regularly swim. Many of us have concern about ongoing discharges from the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant and the potential damage that dredging is causing to the ecosystem and biodiversity in Dublin Bay. It is not just about human usage of the bay; we also want to protect marine life and biodiversity. We need a joined-up and co-ordinated approach to the protection and enhancement of the bay. This Bill and the statutory authority it envisages would represent an important first step towards realising the true potential of the bay. I look forward to the Government accepting the Bill given that it has a very important environmental purpose and could really garner cross-party support. I look forward to future debates on it and to working with colleagues and others in the new year to ensure it will pass."	spk_154

I thank my colleagues — including Deputies Howlin and Sherlock, councillors Níall McNelis and John Maher and others in the party — who have contacted me to express their concern over the tendering process proposed by the Department and to express their support for this motion, which I am glad to support. I have received other representations from individuals in local employment services and those affected in Dublin, Cork, Wexford, Galway and other locations right around the country, including my area, Dublin Bay South. I spoke this afternoon to SIPTU's public administration and community division organiser, Mr. Adrian Kane. I am grateful to officials in Fórsa, whom I am aware have also been working on this matter. I know from engagement with SIPTU, Fórsa and others that we will see SIPTU members in local employment services in County Offaly, including Tullamore, and in Portarlington, County Laois, engaging in industrial action next week owing to a dispute resulting from the Government's termination of its contract with the local community sector companies that employ them. I am aware of the great concern of so many over the prospect of redundancy as a result of the tendering process. I ask the Minister to engage with the unions to ensure redundancies do not occur as a result of the decision. I am aware that the Minister has spoken about engagement but further, meaningful engagement is clearly necessary. The call from SIPTU is for the Minister to instruct her officials in the Department of Social Protection to put concrete proposals on the table to deal with the job losses in the sector that have already resulted from round one of the tendering process and to halt it or pause it, as the motion requires, before it moves on to round two. All of us will be cognisant that it is a stark situation for local employment staff to be in. They fear they will lose their jobs. Many of them have worked for many years in a system in which they have built up institutional knowledge and know-how on behalf of the State in assisting those who are out of work. There are now fearful that they themselves will lose their jobs. They provide many services in assisting people's transition to full-time employment or additional training. In many cases, these are simply not quantifiable in monetary terms. We are anxious that the baby not be thrown out with the bathwater owing to the change in process. What many of those in the sector genuinely feel is that the net effect of the creation of the new service and process will be that a set of metrics will be put in place that will specify impractical and unrealistic targets and milestones. There is genuine concern that the new tendering processes will lead to the wholesale privatisation of local employment services and effectively force out community-based, non-profit providers. While I accept that the Minister says that is not the intention, there is clear and genuine concern that this would be the effect of the process. Although we are still working through the devastating Covid pandemic, we are all conscious that these sorts of community-based, not-for-profit services are needed, now more than ever, in local areas. That is why I stress again the need for meaningful engagement with representatives of staff, service providers and service users. We want to ensure the services provided are not monetised in a way that results in job losses and takes the heart out of them. What is unique about the current circumstances is that both employers and trade unions are effectively united on this issue. That does not happen often. Let me refer to the multiple local employment services that carry out vital work in my area, Dublin Bay South, particularly at St. Andrew's Resource Centre, Pearse Street, which I have visited many times. The service at St. Andrew's, Eastside & Docklands Local Employment Service, is a joint enterprise of St. Andrew's Resource Centre and the Inner City Renewal Group, Dublin 1. My colleague Senator Marie Sherlock commended this service in the Seanad when addressing the Taoiseach last week. It is really worth mentioning some of the work done through the St. Andrew's centre. Staff there told me they spotted significant demand some years ago for construction skills. We are all aware of shortages in that sector. The service started a construction-skills programme that takes in 20 men every week, many of whom are from backgrounds of severe disadvantage, in some cases involving prison terms or addiction issues. The individuals can start work on a construction site after the intensive training provided on the course. They start work in a skilled job that pays well and that will see an increase in income as time goes on. This is transformative in the lives of the individuals concerned, but the intrinsic value of such a transformative service often cannot be measured in the monetary terms or by the metrics that may be prescribed as a result of the new process. The service I have mentioned is just one that I am familiar with in my area. I am conscious that there are services in Crumlin, Dolphin's Barn and the Liberties. Among the many individuals who have contacted me — and, I am sure, others — is Ms Una Lowry, the CEO of the Dublin South City Partnership, Dublin 12. She has expressed her concerns and those of her organisation regarding the new models being rolled out. She has said they are being rolled out without establishing any forum that would research and scope out the best model of employment services for those outside the labour market and without seeking sufficient engagement with a stakeholder forum to build a robust new model. When we examine the kinds of models that exist, including the partnership in Dublin 12 and the service at St. Andrew's, Pearse Street, we see genuine engagement with local communities and businesses.To give credit to Dublin Port, it has given St. Andrew's Resource Centre a site from which to operate its construction skills programme free of charge. We see real engagement at a local level on the ground because these services are community-based and, therefore, have access to funding for a variety of activities that might not be available to privately run or commercial providers. That is the crucial transformative programme that is functioning so well under the current model. There are, therefore, real concerns that the changes will lead to a deterioration in levels of engagement, community involvement and community benefit. The Minister referred to the ILDN. It is seeking meaningful engagement on the advice secured from third parties on procurement, the financial model, the impact of citizens and the sourcing of funding for redundancies if they arise. The network has reiterated concerns that the model proposed is an unsuitable for-profit model that has not been proven to work anywhere in the world, particularly for those who are distant from the labour market and who will need additional supports to become employed or to enter the labour market again. The ILDN is concerned that the model is not evidence-based, has not been tested or piloted and has not received endorsement from academic researchers. It is also concerned that it will transfer risks from the funder to the contract holder, thereby jeopardising not-for-profit community organisations not just at bid stage but also in implementation as there is considerable risk of operating at a loss that cannot be addressed by reserves or alternative income. These are real concerns that highlight the difficulty not-for-profit community providers face in seeking to enter a competitive procurement process that is very likely to have the effect of favouring the bigger, for-profit providers, which, realistically, will have more experience in making these sorts of tender applications and will, therefore, bring very different kinds of measures to the table. The Minister has said phase 2 will refer more to social value and social engagement. That is welcome but it still does not go far enough in answering those valid concerns that have been expressed by so many entities, including Fórsa, SIPTU, the ILDN, the individual service providers, the CEOs of the services and, most importantly, those who are being given the chance to make transformative life changes through the work of the services. It is unsustainable to continue on the current trajectory. I ask that the Minister consider, as the motion requires, suspension of plans to tender out services and consider, with her Government colleagues, supporting the motion, as we in Labour Party do. The sector is united against the current trajectory and we ask that she listens to all those who are on the front line.	spk_323

I have seen the figures for students' eligibility for free fees and I very much welcome the increase in the SUSI maintenance grant and the Minister's commitment to having that review completed by Christmas as well as his acknowledgement that the SUSI scheme needs overhaul. As the Minister said, the issue of student accommodation is not new. For far too long, we have had an over-reliance on the private rented sector which clearly does not have the capacity to deliver accommodation for students. It costs between €7,000 and €11,000 per year for accommodation on campus in UCD and in Trinity. These are exorbitant costs for students. At the protest last week, we heard stories of students who are commuting several hours to college each day, students who are sharing unsuitable cramped spaces due to unaffordable rent and competing with young professionals for scarce beds in Irish cities. Developments designated as so-called student accommodation are out of reach for them. We should not forget the plight of PhD and other postgraduate students who are suffering as a result of cost-of-living increases.	spk_354

We can contrast that with €170 in France and no fee in Germany or Denmark. I am conscious the Union of Students in Ireland called for a reduction in the budget but it was not included in the overall package.

Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-11-25	dail	33	Mother and Baby Institutions: Statements	dbsect_35	"I welcome the second opportunity this week to speak for the Labour Party on this really important matter. It is helpful to come back a second time in the same week to discuss this matter and engage with the Minister. First, I express my sincere sympathies on behalf of my Labour Party colleagues to all survivors and their families. All Oireachtas Members have received a great deal of communication and have had engagement with and met many survivors and affected persons. I thank all who have been so generous as to get in touch with us and express their personal experiences. I pay tribute again to them and to all those who demonstrated such courage on programmes like ""Who am I?"", which aired on RTÉ earlier this year. We are all conscious that this debate and the publicity and news around the scheme will have triggered many painful memories and difficult experiences for many. We need to discuss in a respectful and dignified manner the detail of the scheme. We are also conscious that the publication of the report generated a national conversation on the practices of illegal and forced adoption, coerced labour and institutionalisation of vulnerable populations of women and children. In my new role as Chair of the Special Committee on Gender Equality I am conscious we will address the 45 recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, many of which address the legacy of shameful treatment of women and children through so many decades of our history. We are conscious, in debating mother and baby homes, that women and children were incarcerated in those homes until as recently as 1998 and that many thousands of women passed through the institutions right to the end of the past century. On the terms of the scheme itself, I was glad to speak to the cross-party motion and I welcomed that the Government did not oppose its passage last night. It was a very positive action. I also welcomed many aspects of the scheme, as the Minister referenced in his address, particularly the learning from Residential Institutions Redress Board scheme and that this scheme will not require evidence of abuse or harm. Instead, it will be a more straightforward and accessible process, which is very welcome. I also welcome that it will be a non-adversarial process. It is good to hear the Minister's clarity on the waiver and the assurance that survivors will be entitled to financial support for independent legal advice prior to signing a waiver, which is crucial. It is also important there will be no gagging clause, which was a painful aspect for survivors of the residential institutions before the redress board was established. The scheme should be made more inclusive, however, and I spoke on Tuesday on the need in particular for the Government to accept the amendment proposed by my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Sherlock, in February and which the House passed with unanimous support. That would give an entitlement to an enhanced medical card to women and children who spent any period in an institution. That would be without the six-month criterion. I heard just today from a survivor who described her experience of forced labour and forced adoption in a mother and baby home in which she spent less than six months. She had a feeling of hurt on being excluded from the enhanced medical card scheme. I ask again that the Minister brings in those who spent less than six months in institutions into the enhanced medical card scheme. I do not see the reason for the restriction, which is unfortunate given that the Minister has been more inclusive in the terms than the commission recommended, which is also welcome. The six-month restriction will not apply for redress to mothers, although it will for children. Again, that seems an unnecessary restriction, given so many babies would have spent less than six months in the home and yet would deal with the lifelong trauma as a result of their time incarcerated in homes. They were then adopted or fostered. I also mention the timing of the scheme. The Minister stated on Tuesday night there would be legislation before this House in the new year to give a statutory underpinning to the scheme, and that will clearly give all of us more opportunity to engage constructively. I welcome that. However, it suggests the timing of delivery of redress will be further delayed, so I ask again that the Minister might contemplate making an interim payment scheme available, particularly to those who he says are being prioritised because they are older or particularly vulnerable. It would be a welcome reassurance to many survivors who are very anxious about the practical application of what we are debating tonight. I addressed the question of who will pay on Tuesday night, as others have done, and all of us are very conscious that religious orders and church authorities are and were highly culpable in the running of these institutions. Through their religious instruction and dogma, along with the dominance they continue to have in our schooling system, they set the context within which so many women were effectively coerced into these homes or certainly institutionalised in the homes. We are all conscious, again from the experience with the previous redress scheme, that religious authorities have not always paid their fair share. I am very glad to hear the Minister will meet the religious orders in the coming weeks and I hope the engagement will be fruitful. We have seen ongoing issues, however, with what I have described as the ""developer's wife syndrome"", where religious orders have all too often transferred their assets into the ownership of lay-run trusts, which have no liability to the State in terms of unpaid redress. The religious orders, which retain the legal liability, would then have no assets, as the Minister is well aware, which is a major question that may well have to be addressed in this scheme's context too. I am conscious that on Tuesday we also heard from a senior counsel, Mr. Stephen Dodd, who gave us a very detailed legal opinion as to why the State should compulsorily purchase the national maternity hospital site rather than enabling religious orders to retain it in their ongoing ownership. These are very much current matters around religious orders, land ownership and asset transfer. We must be mindful of that. I will also address the practice of forced or illegal adoption. I am conscious the system of adoption broadly was not within the remit of the commission and outside its terms of reference. We in the Labour Party have called for a comprehensive review of the entire system of secret adoption and family separation, falsified birth certificates and the practices that went on that are alluded to and referenced, particularly in the confidential committee section of the report. Women spoke of having babies snatched from their arms before final adoption papers were completed. We must hear more on that and it is a longer-term project."	spk_320

In his address to COP26, he said that every second of delay makes the task to cut emissions that bit bigger. He is correct. The crisis is cumulative and while we wait to take action we allow the problem to get worse. Unfortunately, not only were many of the outcomes of COP26 frustrating in betraying a lack of urgency at world leader level, in Ireland we are also seeing repeatedly long delays and missed deadlines in this Government's response to climate change. We very much welcome the ambitious national climate targets. It is necessary that those targets are in place and that we all sign up to the targets of a 51% reduction by 2030 and to achieve net zero by 2050. That is vital, but we are not seeing the necessary detail of how we will achieve those targets. Last night, I addressed this to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan. Following publication of the climate action plan, which sets out these very ambitious targets, I asked him when we would see publication of the accompanying detailed annex of actions, with timelines, to support delivery of the plan. The response I got from the Minister was that it would be published in the coming weeks. This detailed annex of actions and timelines is essential to provide all of us, and all the different sectors, with the information necessary to show us how we will achieve the necessary emission reduction targets.

I want to ask about the Government's spending on temporarily renting private beds in private hospitals. The Labour Party has continually advocated for expanding public healthcare by purchasing private hospitals outright. We are conscious that with the Covid plans, the Government essentially, at one point, took over full capacity of the private system. We now have this arrangement for leasing. We know that this arrangement cost the taxpayer €350 million between March and June 2020, and that a deal is currently in place with private hospitals should there be a need for them to manage capacity. How much is being spent on this temporary renting out of private beds in private hospitals? We have argued that the money would be better used to permanently expand our public capacity in a bid to tackle our ever-growing waiting lists, which we are all conscious of, our ageing population and the ongoing, devastating battle with the Covid pandemic. Sláintecare calls for the building of three elective hospitals. This part of Sláintecare is essential to deliver the massive, radical reforms that out healthcare system so badly needs. It would surely be much better and more efficient to use the resources already available, by buying the hospitals to fulfil that key Sláintecare recommendation to support our healthcare service through the pandemic and beyond. We know 50% of the population has private health insurance. This expense is built on a fear that the public system will not be able to care for us and will not have the necessary capacity if we fall sick. Looking at European neighbours and at how other countries are coping with Covid, we think that now would be the best time to prepare our healthcare system. I ask the Taoiseach about the spending on private beds.	spk_214

Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-11-23	dail	33	Climate Action Plan 2021: Statements	dbsect_14	"I welcome the opportunity to join this debate today on behalf of Labour. It is timely, following the conclusion of COP26. Although many of us might have mixed feelings about what was agreed on COP26, undoubtedly some progress was made, albeit not, perhaps, as much as we would have liked. Certainly, the onus is now on countries such as our own to deliver on the climate commitments made. I welcomed the recent publication of the Government's climate action plan which, as Members are aware, sets out 475 separate actions leading to the necessary emissions reductions that we have committed to, in other words, to halve our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. It includes provision for extensive offshore wind power, the retrofitting of 500,000 homes and other targets, such as the putting of 1 million electric vehicles on Irish roads by 2030. These were ambitious but necessary targets which my party very much welcomed. Without sight of the detailed annexe, however, to which the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smith, referred and which apparently will be published shortly to support delivery of the plan, it is difficult to see how we can achieve those targets and what steps are to be taken. I am mindful of the Climate Change Advisory Council's clear recommendation that it is in the next two to three years that we need to see the necessary investment to develop the infrastructure, around, for example, offshore wind generation and electric vehicle, EV, charging that will help us deliver on those more ambitious yearly reductions targets that we have set ourselves for the latter half of this decade up to 2030. There are huge questions as to how we can meet the targets, as to what are the steps that will be taken and whether Government is serious about meeting those targets. This is causing immense frustration among all of us affected: householders who are looking to do retrofitting, farmers who are not clear on agriculture targets and those who are still awaiting decent active and public transport infrastructure. Indeed, in my own area, in Dublin Bay South, there is huge frustration at the delays built into the BusConnects and the National Transport Authority plans. That frustration is felt across Dublin but, certainly, in Dublin Bay South, I am communicated with daily by constituents who are looking to do the right thing, who want to move to active travel and who want, if they have a car, to switch to an EV. Motorists are stymied unless they are lucky enough to have a driveway. There are many areas, such as my own in Portobello, where most households do not have driveways, where most parking is on-street parking and where there are simply not enough publicly accessible EV chargers to make it feasible or practical for many people to switch to EVs. I am frustrated by trying to ensure that we see the greater provision of EV chargers in publicly accessible areas across Dublin Bay South and I can see the frustration experienced by many who want to do the right thing but have simply not been given a clear pathway to do so through the lack of development of the infrastructure. It is difficult to see how we will meet that target in transport, for example, of putting 1 million EVs on Irish roads, or, indeed, meeting our targets of significantly fewer journeys by car, if we do not build and put in the infrastructure. I will not even start on the difficulties of getting pedestrian crossings and better facilities for cyclists and pedestrians in my area. There is frustration there. I note, in his speech, the Minister of State talked about retrofitting. There are frustrating delays here where the Minister of State noted ""the activity level to date is not sufficient for our ambition"". That sums up, unfortunately, a real lack of urgency and really serious delays that have been built into our processes. We need to address those as a matter of urgency because we need to see that sort of urgent and radical response driving governments around the world when it comes to climate change. The Taoiseach himself acknowledged this in his address to COP26 when he stated that ""every second of delay"" makes the task to cut emissions ""that bit bigger"". Of course, the Taoiseach is right. The crisis is cumulative and when we wait to take action, as we all know, the problem gets worse. Unfortunately, we have seen these substantial and significant delays built in. It means then that there is a lack of clarity about how we meet those targets. As I said, we urgently need the investment in the infrastructure now. We saw delays in the publication of the climate action plan itself and I have addressed those in previous debates in this House. It was disappointing, for example, that it was not aligned with the fiscal budget, as had been initially promised. As we know, we are well into the key decade in which we have to put in place the infrastructure to reduce our emissions by half by 2030. In addition to putting those measures in place, we also need to see - maybe this will be in the annexe - what are the vital redistributive measures that will deliver the just transition that will bring the public with us and that will ensure that those who might be adversely affected by necessary measures will be given the necessary supports. That is what we mean by just transition. We have seen through the pandemic the value of State intervention, public service and collective solidarity. That sense of the importance of public services and of the public sector has been reflected in recent election results where we have seen parties of the left winning in Germany, Norway and elsewhere with a growing consciousness of the need for that strong collective solidarity to also weigh in behind our response to climate change. It is through that sort of solidarity, through the empowerment of ordinary people and through effective and clear communication that we will bring society with us on meeting those targets and then we will all reap the benefits of a world in which a better society is possible, with cleaner air, warmer homes, better infrastructure and support for biodiversity. Labour is willing to play a constructive role. Indeed, we are doing that in opposition. I put forward, as the Minister of State will be aware, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (Carbon Footprint Labelling) Bill 2021 and I was glad the Government did not oppose that. I am also putting forward a Bill on Dublin Bay to try to introduce a statutory authority for Dublin Bay to improve the governance of Dublin Bay to ensure that we do not see the sort of developments we saw this week with algae growing across the water and real concerns among sea swimmers and others who use the wonderful amenity, as I and so many of us do, that there is not any proper or adequate monitoring of water quality in Dublin Bay. It is that sort of initiative that we propose to take. We will also be introducing a right to repair Bill with measures to stop waste and to tackle the cost of living by requiring manufacturers of digital electronic equipment to make available repair information to consumers. We want to work with the Minister of State in a range of ways to ensure that we meet those ambitious but necessary climate targets and to ensure that we achieve that just transition that is also so crucial."	spk_142

My Labour Party colleagues and I were happy to co-sign the motion to render it more of a truly cross-party motion. I welcome the Minister's announcement that the Government will not oppose it and I look forward to further constructive engagement on the legislation the Minister descried that will be introduced in the new year that will form the basis of the scheme. It is a genuine attempt to work to strengthen and improve the redress scheme. It is appropriate that we would all work on a cross-party, collaborative basis and I think survivors would want that. Many of us have received emails from and have been contacted by survivors who have eloquently conveyed their feelings and experiences. We have all heard the very powerful voices of survivors. I want to pay tribute to the incredible women like Catherine Corless, former Tánaiste, Joan Burton, the late Christine Buckley, Rose and Mags McKinney, Susan Lohan, Anne O'Meara, Samantha Long and all those who used their voices so bravely in pursuing justice and who have spoken out about the injustices that they experienced. We owe them a collaborative approach to ensure that their trauma does not become a political football and that we can move forward in a non-adversarial fashion. I want to express my sympathies, and those of my Labour Party colleagues, to all those who experienced suffering and distress in the mother and baby, county and Bethany homes. Since its publication in January, the report of the commission has generated intense debate which has been both painful and cathartic for survivors as well as for our society more generally. It has built on the reports of other shameful institutional practices in our State like the Ryan commission report, the Murphy report and so many reports that exposed the abuses to which women and children in particular endured in so many institutions over a relatively short time. Our history of institutional abuse is horrific. We have incarcerated people, women and children, in particular, for far too long. The witness evidence in the report really exposed the violations of human rights of so many. We know a total of 56,000 mothers and 57,000 children passed through the institutions in the decades examined. Thousands more were residents in other institutions outside the terms of reference of the commission. A shocking mortality rate for infants was exposed in the report and 9,000 infants and babies in the homes covered by the report died before their first birthday. That is a really shocking rate of 15% or one in seven. Within the confidential committee section in particular, we learned of the true extent of abuse, both physical and psychological, suffered by survivors. There was also the widespread practice of forced labour and the extensive practice of coerced or forced adoption. We are all conscious that, as the Minister acknowledged, there can be no quantification of the distress and trauma caused. It is very difficult, indeed probably impossible, to place any sort of price on what is owed to survivors by the State, religious orders and all those complicit, including pharmaceutical companies. That is something I want to refer to. In my previous life as a barrister I had the privilege of representing survivors of abuse before the Residential Institutions Redress Board, so I have experience of working within one of those redress schemes. I learned from so many of the terrible harms they had suffered in those institutions but I also witnessed the flaws in that system and I think we clearly learned from that scheme. It essentially institutionalised a hierarchy of suffering in that it required survivors to provide evidence of harm and abuse suffered in institutions in order to achieve a certain level of compensation. Appearing before the board was a very difficult and very traumatic process for those survivors who did so. Many of them told me they felt it was pitting survivors against each other, so that was a really retraumatising impact. It was obviously devised with the best of intentions but we see how difficult it is to develop an effective, robust compensation scheme. Learning from that, there are many aspects of this redress scheme that are very welcome and that are clearly a great improvement. The scale of this scheme is hugely welcome, with 34,000 survivors eligible for financial payments and 19,000 eligible for an enhanced medical card. It is to be non-adversarial and that is very welcome. It is to be accessible and there is no requirement to submit evidence of abuse or harm caused, and again that is really welcome. There is no requirement of silence, as I understand it, and that again is very welcome because that was a really unfortunate facet of the previous scheme. Those are all the welcome aspects but of course there are also critiques that have been expressed in recent days. They are very valid ones because there are still a number of people who will be excluded. While it is great women survivors who live abroad will qualify, as well as those who spent less than six months in the institutions, we still see a distinction where children who spent less than six months will be ineligible for payment, as will children who were boarded out, unless they spent their first six months in an institution. Women who spent less than six months in an institution have been excluded from the enhanced medical card scheme and that is really regrettable, especially as many of those women will have arrived at the institutions in late stages of pregnancy. We have heard from many who suffered physical harm and medical harm as a result of incarceration. Indeed, back on 24 February this Dáil passed an amendment from my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, to give an entitlement to a medical card to all former residents of mother and baby and county homes. I ask that the Minister consider giving effect to that intention of the Dáil as expressed following a very constructive debate that day. That is something others have also sought and it is called for in the motion. Many survivors have also expressed concern about the timeline for redress and concerns that if the scheme does not open until late 2022 then payments may not be expected until 2023. I ask that the Minister might examine the feasibility of a programme of interim payments to survivors, as was done in the North. I am aware he said he will prioritise older and vulnerable survivors but there is that other mechanism of an interim payment scheme and it might well meet some needs of survivors. I also want to address the point the Minister raised in his speech of who pays for the scheme and the role of the religious orders. The executive summary of the commission’s report was widely criticised for spreading blame perhaps too broadly beyond State and church and saying responsibility rests mainly with fathers and immediate families. We need to re-emphasise the causative role of both State and church authorities. We know how powerful the church was for so many of the decades in which these institutions prevailed and we know the church was also, through its teaching of ethical and moral dogma, directly responsible for generating the moral context within which shame and secrecy prevailed for so many who were incarcerated in the homes. Not until the Labour Party's Frank Cluskey introduced what was called then the unmarried mothers allowance in 1973 did the State take any responsibility for women who had been so shamefully neglected for so many decades. Not until 1987 did we finally pass laws to abolish the status of illegitimacy. State and church thus bear huge responsibility for the suffering of women in these institutions. Indeed, it was not just the Catholic Church. We know Protestant churches also had a role in incarceration. We are conscious also that obstructiveness was displayed by some of the orders involved during the compilation of the report and that has certainly been made public. Therefore, we need to see a much greater role for the religious orders in bearing the financial cost of redress. I again refer to the residential institutions redress scheme and the well-known failure of church and religious orders to pay what was their fair share of redress, leaving the State to bear the disproportionate cost of the scheme. The reasons for that have been well-aired in this House and elsewhere. We in the Labour Party have called for religious institutions to make a fair and proportionate contribution to this redress and the Minister has stated his intention that they would do so. If they do not, we have committed to drafting legislation to compel them to make a contribution. I hope it will not come to that because, again, I think we have learned from the experiences of the past. We need to look at the role of private capital in the system of abuse. In chapter 34 of the commission’s report the issue of vaccine trials was discussed in great detail. It is really disappointing to learn pharmaceutical companies involved in those trials apparently do not see it as necessary to make a financial contribution. I ask the Minister that we look again at that. We must acknowledge that there are many other measures that are crucial for survivors. This includes the adoption (information and tracing) Bill 2021 our committee is currently reviewing and, of course, a comprehensive review of adoption practices in this country, which we think should be done to ensure we are truly dealing with the legacy of the past. We must look at issues around illegal adoptions, in particular, forced and coerced adoptions and falsified birth certificates. We need to work constructively with the Minister and we certainly intend to do so to ensure the strengthening of this redress scheme, but also that these other measures that are so sorely needed by survivors are put in place. I look forward to doing so and I am glad that we will not see a vote on the motion, which has cross-party support.	spk_208
Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-11-18	dail	33	Residential Institutions	dbsect_36	I have sought to discuss the crisis in staffing in the home care sector and Government proposals to address it. The reason I raise this matter is because I have been contacted by a number of constituents who are extremely anxious about the current difficulties with recruiting staff to care for people in their homes. In other words, home care workers. We know that we simply do not have enough home care workers and that hospital patients who are ready for discharge are occupying scarce hospital beds because of a shortage of home care workers. In September, the Committee of Public Accounts heard from the HSE's chief operations officer, Anne O'Connor, that there are not enough people applying for home care jobs in either the public or private sector. We hear that in some cases HSE community organisations are only able to deliver 60% of home care needed. This is impacting on patients who need home care in order to leave hospital, but it clearly is also impacting on many other people who require care in their own homes. As we know, there is a policy, which I support, of decongregation or of moving on from congregated settings. As the Minister of State will be aware, that is the Government's policy. The concern is that the Government will simply not be able to move people on from congregated settings or, indeed, to keep people from going into congregated settings without the recruitment of additional home care staff. There is a lack of any governmental response to this difficulty. As I said earlier, I have been contacted by a number of individuals and organisations on this matter, including Home and Community Care Ireland, who told me that its providers is at close to full capacity. That organisation is on record that 8,000 carers are urgently needed in order to look after elderly persons in their own homes. I have called for a new a fair deal. We should be adjusting or amending the fair deal scheme to prioritise care for people in their own homes, rather than prioritising nursing home and congregated settings. This is a real concern. I have also been contacted by people who are carers and individuals who require care, including one constituent who is upset in circumstances where a home care package has been compromised to the point where the person who requires care is expected to cover for home carers unpaid. I have also been contacted by a constituent who is a carer. She told me that as a non-EU worker she does not have any security of status. I am asking the Minister of State what the Government proposes to do about this? I understand that due to the exclusion of home caring from the critical skills occupational list prepared by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, many of those who are currently providing home care and who are from outside of the EU are leaving to work in nursing homes and hospitals. We need to ensure that there is an overall Government scheme put in place to ensure that we can recruit enough home care workers and that, if necessary, any issues around visas for those from outside of the EU who are carrying out home care are sorted out. The provision of employment permits is one issue. Staffing is an issue, but it is clear that conditions and pay in the sector are also issues. I have previously submitted a parliamentary question on this issue, to which I received a response on 9 November from the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment stating that a recent review of the critical skills exemption for the non-EEA employment permit system for home care workers did not recommend removal of the occupation of care worker or home carers from the ineligible occupations list. If we are not seeing a move towards resolving this issue at that level, I want to know what the Government is doing to ensure that we will have enough supply of home care workers to carry out the necessary care in the home that people like my constituent and his husband so badly require.	spk_346
Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-11-18	dail	33	Residential Institutions	dbsect_36	I thank the Minister of State for his response and for setting out the Government's aspirations, but it is shocking that nearly 5,000 people, according to his figures, have been assessed and are still waiting for a carer to become available. There is no indication, although he might be able to provide it, as to how long they have been waiting. The shortage of home care workers clearly indicates there is a recruitment crisis, which is causing immense hardship, distress and suffering to many of those who are awaiting the allocation of care hours and to the members of their family, who may be in their immediate household, who are currently taking on the role of carer. It is also causing immense uncertainty and hardship for carers. One individual told me she has sent emails to many Deputies, media outlets and others. She notes that the majority of clients are very vulnerable. People need care and there are people available to provide it but because of the difficulties with visas for non-EU workers, there is a recruitment crisis. The response I received to a parliamentary question on this issue states that the difficulty is caused by contracts of employment and employment terms and conditions. These are the significant factors in the recruitment challenges faced by the sector, I am told, rather than a demonstrable labour market shortage. If that is the case, what is the Government doing to sort out the contracts of employment and the terms and conditions being offered? There is clearly an enormous need and demand for people to have access to home care assistants in their homes. It is extremely important for us all that we are moving towards a society where people are not required to be sent into congregated settings when they need care because the State is providing supports and care for such individuals in their own homes. I want to be of assistance in addressing this serious recruitment crisis. We need to see a freeing up of the logjam that is currently blocking access for people who need home care assistants.	spk_348

Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-11-18	dail	33	Disability Funding Report: Motion	dbsect_41	I thank Deputies Cairns and Canney for giving up their time. I acknowledge the presence of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte. As a former member of the committee in my role as a Senator, I was glad to take part in some of the hearings that led to the production of this report, albeit I had to leave the committee on my election to this House before the report was completed. It was, as Deputy Canney has said, a powerful experience to hear the testimonies of persons with disabilities, to hear representatives from disabled people's organisation and to hear renowned experts, such as Professor Gerard Quinn, speak about the importance of the UNCRPD and of implementing a truly rights-based approach for persons with disabilities. We all learned a great deal - I know I did - from the experience of being on the committee and I want to acknowledge that. I also commend my former colleagues on the committee, including Deputies Tully and Michael Moynihan, whom we all wish a speedy recovery, for the immense work that went into the report and for the strong recommendations in it. The voices of the individuals who we heard and their experiences are reflected in these recommendations. That is really important too. It is disappointing to learn, despite that key recommendation that the optional protocol would be urgently ratified, that it will be delayed. The Minister frankly acknowledged difficulties with it. I wonder will we see ratification in 2022, as is hoped for in the committee's report or is it likely to be delayed further. That is a key question. It is also disappointing to hear of the delay in the transfer of functions between Departments. There is an ambitious programme of transfer of functions. The disability unit that was within the Department of Justice has now moved to the new Department, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, but I understand the disability functions in the Department of Health have yet to transfer.I recall raising this issue at committee hearings with the Minister of State. At that point, it seemed that those functions would transfer sooner. I know there have been difficulties with individual hard cases, for example, falling between Departments. I hope we will see a very speedy and efficient roll-out of that transfer.  I will refer to a number of key recommendations, in particular on education and recommendations Nos. 23 to 26, inclusive, on the need to see a roll-out of ASD units and of SNAs to children with particular needs. In my own constituency in Dublin Bay South, I met with quite a number of parents on Monday night about their immense distress and frustration and not being able to access places for their children. We have a real shortage of ASD units in Dublin 2, 4 and 6. It is something that I have raised, as have others, in both Houses. We really need to see this addressed urgently so I am really glad the committee is highlighting that issue. The report acknowledges rightly that transport and housing are key factors to enable people with disabilities to live independently. On travel, I am really glad to see universal design thinking emphasised. There are two issues that disabled constituents have raised with me consistently. One is the need to regulate e-scooters. I was sorry I did not get a chance to speak on the Road Traffic Bill earlier. We ran out of time. It is vitally important that we regulate the use of e-scooters. These really cause people with disabilities and mobility issues a great deal of concern due to unregulated usage and the danger that presents to all of us on roads and footpaths.  There is the issue of free travel. Epilepsy Ireland, in particular, has been campaigning for change to ensure that individuals will have greater access to free travel passes where people with epilepsy may feel it is not safe to use private cars. I am really glad that housing and care is really emphasised in this report. Something that came up at many of our hearings was the need to ensure and facilitate and move away from congregation settings for persons with disabilities. However, as the report acknowledges, there are still significant numbers of persons under 65 years of age still housed in nursing homes and people in congregated settings where they should be facilitated with a move to community-based and smaller settings. This is an issue that I think we really need, again to focus on with much greater urgency. I raised it just this evening in a Topical Issue debate. There is a crisis in terms of recruitment of home carers. There is such a shortage. All of us are hearing it in every constituency. We are hearing it from those who require care themselves, either due to age or disability, from their carers within families and, indeed, from the carers themselves who have come to so many of us looking for greater certainty and better conditions. We have also heard from the providers of care services who tell us that they cannot recruit staff. In order to move to the decongregation which the committee heard so much about, we need to address this crisis so that people will be supported in living independently in their own homes through the provision of home-based care. That is an essential part of the new fair deal as well for those persons with needs that have in the past meant they were institutionalised but who happily, now, in a more enlightened time we hope we can support at home. However, I learned earlier that nearly 5,000 people, as of September, who have been assessed for home support hours were still awaiting allocation for a home carer. That is a shocking figure in 2021. I think that illustrates the difficulty with achieving that rights-based approach that this report so rightly demands.	spk_376

Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-11-17	dail	33	National Standards Authority of Ireland (Carbon Footprint Labelling) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_9	"I move: ""That the Bill be now read a Second Time."" I am glad to introduce this important Bill on behalf of the Labour Party. Following the publication of the Government's climate action plan and the conclusion of the COP26 talks in Glasgow last week, we have seen increased urgency and increased public focus on the need to take urgent measures to tackle the climate crisis and the need to ensure we put in place a just transition and climate justice measures. In all of our constituencies, such as my own in Dublin Bay South, we see individuals, households and communities coming forward wanting to contribute to our communal effort to tackle our carbon emissions and bring about a genuinely decarbonised society. However, we need supports to do this. That is why we are introducing this Bill. We in the Labour Party are a party of serious environmentalists. We are serious about offering practical ways to meet our climate targets. That seriousness of intent was evident at our party conference at the weekend in the Mansion House, where we passed some important motions on climate and where I informed delegates this Bill was just one of a package of measures we would be introducing in the Dáil and which we see as essential to enable us to reach those vital targets of a 51% reduction by 2030 and net zero by 2050. What does this Bill propose to do and what is carbon labelling? Carbon labelling seeks to give consumers greater information on the environmental impact of goods they will purchase, in other words, the carbon footprint of those goods. Consumers are currently faced with difficulties when seeking to buy sustainably and to buy in a more environmentally friendly fashion. Currently, there is an absence of an overall standard scheme on how to calculate or communicate a product’s carbon footprint to consumers. Increasingly, however, we are seeing moves at international, national and, indeed, corporate levels to develop those standards. There is a clear need for independent, verifiable and universal standards and specifications. The scheme under this Bill would empower consumers by enabling informed choices to be made. It would encourage the purchase of goods with lower environmental impact. That is exactly what this Bill seeks to do. Carbon footprint labels being developed attempt to itemise all greenhouse gas emissions relief through the product life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials through to manufacture, distribution, use and eventual disposal. Consumers are increasingly demanding this information. Companies are increasingly moving to introduce their own labelling systems. Just this year, big multinationals such as Unilever announced the introduction of labels across thousands of their products. We see legislatures moving to do this. In Colorado, the ""Buy Clean Colorado"" Bill, which was passed earlier this year, had the same intent. We are increasing momentum around this at EU level. In the circular economy action plan, published in March 2020, the European Commission proposed a revision of consumer law to ensure consumers receive relevant information on products at point of sale. The Commission is also proposing that companies would substantiate environmental claims. It is considering setting minimum requirements for sustainability labels and other information tools. We see this work going on at transnational level. Indeed, we are likely to see significant progress in the near future on the setting of carbon footprint standards. A harmonised EU approach is clearly the preferable way forward on rolling out this system. We are also seeing already significant progress at national level. That is what this Bill seeks to do - to build on that. The National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, the statutory framework on which we based this Bill, is our official standards body. It operates under the National Standards Authority of Ireland Act 1996 and is accountable to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. As the State's official standards body, its function is to inspire consumer confidence through a recognisable and reliable infrastructure of standards for products. The NSAI is already working on developing ways to measure carbon footprints. It is doing so with reference to the International Organization for Standardization, ISO, 14060 suite of standards and guidelines, which seeks to develop a set of auditable tools to help address climate change through a systematic approach to greenhouse gas quantification, monitoring, reporting, validation and verification. The NSAI is already offering an auditing and verification service against a number of ISO 14060 standards. This gives us a basis on which we can develop this scheme of carbon accreditation. We are also seeing civil society pushing forward on this. For example, the NGO, the Carbon Trust, which has been established on our neighbouring island, is already working with companies there to help them measure, manage and reduce the footprint of their products. It provides a blueprint for a product carbon footprint label, which provides consumers with verified information. It provides footprints on a cradle-to-gate basis, used for business-to-business products, measuring emissions from the extraction of raw materials, through to product manufacture, and up to the factory gate. It also provides cradle-to-grave footprints for business-to-consumer products, which is the model we are seeking to develop through this Bill and through the scheme to be established under it. The Carbon Trust follows a product carbon footprint protocol consisting of a carbon life cycle assessment and additional specific rules to certify the footprint according to type of label. There were a number of different labels. It is a useful model to see how practically this could work. Since we launched the Bill yesterday, we have had huge goodwill and support from members of the public for the principle behind it. The question we have been asked is how it would work in practice. It is worth saying we have models elsewhere, we see this working in practice elsewhere, and there is already a momentum for this.This Bill is not some sort of far-fetched or utopian vision. It seeks to establish, in a very practical way, a framework for providing consumers with necessary information to help them make sustainable choices. To return to how this would work in practice, we see the Carbon Trust providing a reducing CO2 label for some products, showing their footprint is reducing year on year and that the company is committed to achieving footprint reductions, in addition to a reducing CO2 packaging label to show the packaging's carbon footprint is also decreasing. We are familiar with other sorts of verification schemes around calorie counting products, nutritional information, fair trade and sustainable production, which are very well-established labelling schemes. Our Bill would build on these frameworks already in place and with which we are all very familiar. It seeks to confer powers on the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the existing body with responsibility in this area, to develop standards to give information about the carbon footprint of commodities and thus to require reporting of greenhouse gas emissions on that cradle-to-grave basis. We want to make it easier for people to take steps to reduce their impact on the environment with this Bill. We know that if we could see this information clearly, it would enable us to make those informed choices. It also places an onus on companies and corporates to stop flag-flying on climate issues. It would expose those who are carrying out what we might describe as greenwashing and would give credit to those who are taking the challenge seriously and taking substantive steps to reduce their carbon footprint. We know the term ""greenwashing"" was coined in the 1980s following a series of advertisements commissioned by the oil giant, Chevron, in an attempt to convince the public of its environmental bona fides. Deputies may recall its advertisements showing feel-good pictures of forest, woodland and so on, which diverted attention from the immense environmental damage being done by fossil fuel production. The term ""greenwashing"" has entered the lexicon and we know this is still a practice that may be used to fool customers into buying products that are not in fact environmentally sustainable. As legislators, we need to devise a scheme that will address the practice of greenwashing and give consumers real choice based on independently verified information. We in the Labour Party, as red greens or as green reds, have always sought to achieve a balance between the interests of consumers and those of society in a way that does not place undue obstacles on business but nonetheless recognises the responsibility of corporates and manufacturers in this regard. We are seeking to rebalance power between consumers, or individual citizens, and corporations. I will briefly mention the issue of gender equality and climate. I am very glad to have been nominated chairperson of the new special Oireachtas committee on gender equality. I note that, as former President Mary Robinson has said, ""Climate change is a man-made problem ... [with] a feminist solution"". In any new climate scheme we introduce, we need to be mindful of the gendered impact of climate change. We have seen that the UN estimates 80% of people displaced by climate change are women. All of us know the impact of the climate crisis upon women, in particular. I mention that because the impact of the climate crisis on gender is something I will be very mindful of in my role on the committee on gender equality. In that context, it is worth mentioning that International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women is next Thursday. I welcome the Government's engagement on this matter and the amendment it has put forward in the sense that it shows constructive engagement. We in the Labour Party are about constructive engagement on this. We will accept the amendment, but we will hold the Government to account to ensure that, in 12 months' time, the Bill will be read a Second Time."	spk_24

Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-11-10	dail	33	Rising Costs and Supply Security for Fuel and Energy: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the energy crisis. There are three specific crises facing us in this country as regards energy. The first is the most pressing for many households, namely, the rising cost of energy bills. The average household in Ireland is facing significantly increased costs. All 14 of Ireland's energy suppliers have increased prices at least once this year. In September, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities warned that people will face higher charges due to record demand and reduced supply. Many people, households and families have real concerns that they will face fuel poverty over the coming winter. That is a real and pressing concern for all of us. We need to hear more from the Government as to how that will be tackled. Second, there is a potential crisis building with regard to the security and certainty of our energy supply. My colleague, Deputy Kelly, raised this with the Taoiseach yesterday. He asked whether it can be guaranteed that the lights will stay on. He also noted that the response to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Sherlock in recent weeks pointed out that there have been seven amber systems alerts in the past 12 months, the most recent having been on 28 October. All of us are concerned about guaranteeing the security of our energy supply. That is very much linked to the rise in prices and the great burden this is placing on households. Of course, there is also a third crisis, which is a global crisis. I refer to the crisis currently being addressed at the Conference of the Parties, COP26, which is discussing how to decarbonise our energy and how to move to reduce our emissions to ensure we do not see a devastating rise in global temperatures over the next decade and beyond. We also need to focus policies on this area. All of us in the Opposition accept that these are challenging crises for the Government to address. There is no doubt about that. It is very difficult to address the challenge of enormous increases in prices for households and the burden that is placing on hard-pressed families and individuals alongside difficulties with supply and the urgent need to decarbonise. However, we need to see more from Government. We need to see more firm and concrete commitments to address these three crises.  Half of our electricity is powered by gas and demand for that has increased as most countries have exited lockdown. That has led to the shortages in supply. Urgent increased investment in other forms of energy generation, particularly in renewables and microgeneration, along with urgent investment in retrofitting will help us to tackle the crises in cost and supply. We have discussed before how we have no shortage of potential energy sources, including solar and wind generation. There is an abundance of wind potential in particular in Ireland. However, to date, we have not put in place the investment to develop infrastructure for offshore wind generation. We need to do so urgently in order to meet the ambitious targets we have set for this decade, up to 2030.  I heard the radio interview with the chief executive of EirGrid, Mark Foley, this morning. He spoke about the challenges in meeting these targets. EirGrid has launched a very ambitious blueprint today, Shaping Our Electricity Future, but there are real questions about how that blueprint can be delivered upon, particularly in light of last week's news of Equinor's withdrawal from Ireland and slowdowns in many areas, not least in transport with the announcement of the greater Dublin area transport plan being delayed.  We need to see more firm commitments on green hydrogen and the roll-out of new technologies. Last week, I asked the Minister of State to outline how the Government intends to make the production of green hydrogen more cost-effective. We again need greater clarity on that. We also need an update on when the new planning regulations on solar generation will be submitted. We all get correspondence from schools, community centres, GAA clubs, football clubs and other sports clubs in our constituencies about how they can contribute to meeting targets by investing in solar generation. There is tremendous goodwill in the community but these groups have so far been stymied and obstructed in installing solar panels and in feeding back into the grid. Microgeneration is of great importance in dealing with shortfalls in energy supply. We also need greater clarity from the Government on the issue of data centres. We know how much of a burden they place on energy supply and we need to hear more about how that is going to be addressed in the future. We have had that debate here.  We also need more firm commitments from the Government with regard to a just transition and how allowances are to be made for those on whom the measures necessary to tackle climate change will have the most impact. We need to ensure that households that are struggling to pay rising fuel and energy bills are supported in doing so. My party believes in the need to sustain a carbon tax. It is one of a suite of measures that is required to help us meet the challenge of this global climate emergency. However, we also believe that Government needs to do more to address the cost that imposes on households. We need better allowances in respect of the fuel allowance and a new carbon tax credit. In our alternative budget, Labour put forward a proposal for an alternative carbon tax credit worth €200 a week for households with incomes of less than €50,000 and whose homes have a building energy rating, BER, lower than B2. That sort of initiative would have been a real signal that Government understands that the transition to a low-carbon or decarbonised economy will have an impact on people and that this impact must be addressed.  There are ways to address this. There are ways that a Government that is green but which also recognises real burdens on struggling households can address these crises in energy costs and energy supply, while at the same time moving forward to decarbonise in all of our interests and in the interests of our global society. As COP26 enters its final days, we all hope and anticipate that we will see a clear pathway given at international level through the memorandum that is being prepared.We also need clarity on the pathway in this country. We need to see how the climate action plan that was launched last week will deliver in practice on the ground and how the impact it is likely to have on individuals who are struggling with fuel costs will be addressed through other Government measures, ensuring a just transition.	spk_39
Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-11-09	dail	33	Regional Transport Infrastructure: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_17	I am glad to speak on this motion for the Labour Party. It provides a timely opportunity for a debate about the need for better public transport and general transport infrastructure. We will support the motion. I am glad the Government is not opposing it. It is timely, especially with the announcement today relating to the greater Dublin area. The motion refers to transport infrastructure outside Dublin. We might take a moment to ponder just how disappointing today's announcement by the NTA is and what knock-on impact it will have for transport infrastructure outside Dublin 2, the counties in the immediate vicinity of Dublin, and for all of us living and working in Dublin city. In my constituency, Dublin Bay South, we clearly need to see what it will mean for us all. It will clearly have a seriously detrimental impact on the Government's ambitious targets for climate emission reductions. That is a real concern. I have been calling on Government to provide greater clarity about the implementation of measures to reduce emissions. I welcome the ambitious climate targets that we have set ourselves. We must all recognise the need to meet those targets. We must also be conscious of the need to have clarity about how those targets are to be delivered. Marie Donnelly, the chair of the Climate Change Advisory Council, was clear last week about the need to put in place, over this year and the next few years, the necessary infrastructure to enable us to deliver the more ambitious reductions in climate over the latter half of this decade, between 2025 and 2030. Yet, today, the NTA made an announcement kicking forward any delivery of major projects, such as MetroLink, light rail and overground infrastructure. This announcement is deeply disappointing. It is an appalling delay. It illustrates why we need a clear timeline and plan to meet targets when we see such delays. One of the positives that we have seen over the last 20 months was an increase in people using active transport such as walking and cycling. I welcome the NTA's commitment to improving infrastructure there. We need to be clear that cycling infrastructure in Dublin is still severely lacking. It still feels unsafe to cycle on many streets in the city centre. I speak as someone who cycles every day. The segregated cycle lanes across many parts of the city are welcome but, all too often, they are not joined up.A cycle lane finishing with oncoming traffic on O'Connell Bridge is one example of that. We need to ensure much better cycle infrastructure and give people the choice of using public transport. Today's announcement for the greater Dublin area is disappointing. There are issues with our transport infrastructure across the country, particularly in the north west. Our policy is to ensure better investment in public transport, not just in Dublin, but in towns and villages across Ireland. We have put forward the idea of a rural transport guarantee to ensure every rural town has guaranteed access to reliable, affordable and sustainable public transport and every child has a guaranteed place on a school bus. Our transport spokesperson, Deputy Duncan Smith, has put forward the need for that joined-up thinking across the country with regard to rural and urban public transport. Some of our public representatives in counties affected by the lack of investment have asked me to put three questions to the Minister of State, which she might address in the round-up at the end. First, Councillor Conor Sheehan in Limerick asked whether the Minister of State will supply a timeline for commuter rail stations around Limerick that were announced in the national development plan. I would be grateful for a response, even in writing at a later date. Second, will the Minister of State provide a timeline for the rail spur to Shannon Airport? That question is also from Councillor Conor Sheehan. Third, Nessa Cosgrove in Sligo asked me to find out when we can expect to see real movement on the western rail corridor. That was clearly an issue of great concern to all those in Sligo and other counties in the west.  As the Labour Party spokesperson on disability, I raise the question of accessible transport. Not only must our transport infrastructure be sustainable and climate-friendly, we must also ensure it is accessible. I have been sent videos of people struggling with wheelchairs on buses and in train stations as part of the Make Way Day campaign and more generally from colleagues in Labour Disability and others. Footpaths and shopping amenities can often be an impediment to access. People with disabilities need guarantees of being able to access public spaces. Local authorities should conduct an audit of accessibility in towns and villages across the country, looking at simple remedies such as dishing of paths to ensure no kerbs, matching up of paths with opposite sides of the road and pedestrian crossings. They may sound like basic and mundane measures but they can be the bedrock for those with disabilities or those pushing buggies, on which safe and secure transport networks are based. These are the sorts of measures that will encourage more people to walk to work or to shops rather than take private cars. We have legislation providing for access officers in all public bodies but we need dedicated disability officers in local authorities to work with planners and ensure we can rectify past mistakes in building infrastructure that is not accessible enough. I have put in parliamentary questions on how public bodies can comply with their obligations under the Disability Act, particularly in ensuring towns and villages are safe for those with disabilities. There is a need to stop further cuts. The motion contains a reference to cuts that have been made to Bus Éireann Expressway routes from Galway, Limerick, Cork and Belfast and states that these cuts have impacted connectivity and frustrated efforts to reduce transport emissions. I endorse the points made in the motion because if we want to reduce our emissions and meet our targets, we must ensure cuts made to routes are reversed. We saw in the Climate Change Performance Index today that our low performance has slipped further. We are now 46th in the rankings on how we have addressed the climate crisis. We remain among the low performers in greenhouse gas emission categories and we know we are performing poorly on international ratings generally on meeting climate targets, despite having set welcome ambitious targets. These cutbacks to crucial routes in cities outside Dublin must be addressed to ensure we meet the targets and provide connectivity for people in different settings. Part of the motion deals with regional airports. Since March 2020, we have consistently called on the Minister for Transport and the Tánaiste to ensure the sectors most affected by the coronavirus pandemic, namely, aviation, tourism and entertainment, continue to receive adequate supports throughout the public health emergency. We are conscious, as all colleagues are, of the unique challenges that have been presented to the aviation sector, in particular. I call on the Minister of State to ensure supports, where necessary, are maintained, particularly for smaller regional airports. The Labour Party supports the motion and urges the Minister of State to look at the announcement made today in relation to the greater Dublin area and ensure that where we have, on the one hand, ambitious targets on emission reductions in transport, we do not with the other hand make cuts to public transport routes, delaying the development of vital public transport infrastructure and not delivering the sort of transport facilities we badly need.	spk_250

However, it was promised last month. It was promised initially that it would be aligned with the fiscal budget. It is unfortunate it was not. There have been long delays. We are already well into the key decade in which we are to reduce our emissions by 51% by 2030. We are now nearly at the end of 2021. I know the Minister of State is more aware of this than any of us. I welcome, as does the Labour Party, the ambition of the targets that we are setting, but we are concerned about inconsistencies and apparent problems with meeting those targets. We see today problems with how we will reach the targets on offshore wind. That is a serious concern, given how much we will be depending on offshore wind to generate a sufficient quantity of renewable energy. We are seeing inconsistency with methane target reductions. We are seeing the Taoiseach committing to 30%, which is welcome, yet only 10% being signed up to in the action plan. We are seeing concerns about a just transition, as houses are struggling to meet energy costs.	spk_22

It is good to hear there are initiatives under way both at European level and here in Ireland. Any engagement I have with stakeholders on how we meet those targets for generation of electricity through renewables indicates green hydrogen is the energy of the future, although that may be a clichéd term. There has been a doubt about whether we can develop the production of green hydrogen in a cost-effective way, as the cost seems to have been the biggest obstacle to development. What I am seeking to explore is precisely what initiatives we can take in Ireland to ensure the roll-out of green hydrogen can be done in a way that is cost-effective.	spk_70

As the Minister of State has acknowledged, we certainly have an opportunity to build out renewables through green hydrogen, among other technologies. This might even allow Ireland to become a green hydrogen exporter in place of being an importer of fossil fuels to generate the energy we need. I very much welcome the ambitious target on the generation of electricity through renewables and I am very conscious of the vision increasingly being promoted around the world of electrifying everything as a way of ensuring we can move to a carbon-neutral or zero-carbon economy and society around the world.

Speaking for the Labour Party, and as a long-standing advocate for animal rights, I am very glad to see this legislation come before us. It is receiving a very broad welcome, which is good to see. There is a growing acceptance of the need for such a prohibition, as others have said. We are also all conscious of the need to ensure a just transition because of the fact that jobs that will be affected by this. For that reason, I am also glad to see the compensation scheme provided for in such detail in the legislation. That is very welcome. I am conscious that although this is directly an animal welfare and health Bill, and very welcome in that regard, we are debating it, as it happens, just as the Government's climate action plan is being published. I thank the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Ryan, and his officials, for putting in place earlier today a very useful and valuable briefing with Opposition spokespersons, including me, on climate, at which we discussed and heard directly from the Minister what is in the climate action plan. The reason I mention it in the context of this Bill is that the climate action plan provides a very welcome requirement for policy coherence and joined-up thinking across all Departments on measures to tackle the climate crisis and the climate emergency.  A key part of that is ensuring greater biodiversity through robust and effective legislation on animal rights and welfare and on protection of our wildlife and natural and wonderful biodiversity. Even though I am a Deputy for an urban area in Dublin Bay South, we have immense biodiversity and a huge amount of great natural amenities in my local community of Portobello. Where I live along the canal, there is a huge number of wildlife and a very good service offered by the council and Waterways Ireland, in many ways, to ensure wildlife, such as the swans on the canal and so on, is protected. That is also the case in Dublin Bay, although we can do much more to ensure better water quality and, therefore, protection of marine life in our waters. I am working with the Minister's colleagues in Government on that along with NGOs such as SOS Dublin Bay. This Bill is part of an overall package of measures that we need to see adopted across all of Government, with constructive support from the Opposition to ensure there are major benefits to our communities from promotion of biodiversity and a joined-up policy like that enumerated in the climate action plan. This will ensure better protection of animals and wildlife and that we have more sustainable cities and communities in line with our sustainable development goals, SDG, 11, to which we have such a commitment. I will not speak for long. I am not the agriculture spokesperson, but I am very glad to speak in support of the Bill and to reiterate my support, and that of the Labour Party, for this important measure, which will see us finally move to a prohibition on fur farming in the interests of animal health, welfare and rights. 	spk_295

With just over a week to the start of the crucial climate talks at COP26 in Glasgow and with only nine years to the 2030 deadline for the achievement of our ambitious and welcome 51% reduction target, what is lacking is a sense of clarity and urgency in the Government's response in respect of its proposed measures to deal the climate emergency and to show how we are going to achieve our emissions reduction targets. Everyone I speak to in the renewable energy sector and people involved in this are concerned about the lack of implementation measures, the lack of urgency and the lack of clarity. We were led to believe that the carbon budgets would be published in the first week of October, before the fiscal budget. It would have been preferable if we could have seen those budgets aligned. It would have been useful to have been able to scrutinise budget 2022 in the context of our vital climate action targets alongside the carbon budgets, but we were unable to do so. Now there are reports this week that the proposals of the Climate Change Advisory Council are likely to be published next week, but the Dáil and Seanad will not be sitting next week. It will be well into the commencement of COP26, therefore, before we will be able to have a debate in the Oireachtas on these crucial documents regarding the crucial measures in the carbon budgets and in the climate action plan. There is also a lack of clarity on other key measures we need to take regarding climate change. There were reports yesterday that the just transition commissioner will not be placed on a statutory footing, as was promised in the programme for Government. What is the position on that? There are also real concerns about the announcement in budget 2022 of the removal of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grant for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. This grant had already been reduced in July from €5,000 to €2,500. We agree with the need to incentivise the move to fully electric vehicles, and I welcome the budget announcement of the extension of the grant in that regard, but there is still a lack of clarity and a lack of notice to people who might have made decisions on making a move to more environmentally-friendly transport and who are now faced with this change. We must ensure that there is public buy-in for the measures necessary to tackle climate change. We have to ensure that people, particularly in rural areas, are assured about decisions and can have confidence in them. We have to bring people with us. That is crucial in advance of COP26. All of us, including those who will be on Merrion Square tomorrow at 1 p.m. for a pre-COP26 climate action protest, want to see real clarity, certainty and urgency from the Government.	spk_210

I am somewhat dismayed to hear that it will be 3 November and later in November before we will see consideration by the Government of the draft climate action plan and publication of the carbon budgets. That appears to be quite significant slippage, particularly as COP26 will have started on 31 October. It is a real concern given that these are measures which have had to be in preparation for a long time. We all are well aware of that and of the section 6A timeline for the carbon budget, which was for the period commencing last January. We know, therefore, that this is something that has been in preparation for a long time. It is simply not good enough to see this slippage into November. I accept what the Minister said about the advisory council, but it is unfortunate to see that long, ongoing delay. I would like a response on the other issues I raised regarding other measures that also require clarity. We also have to emphasise the huge opportunity that lies ahead of us in moving from fossil fuel bases. That is an opportunity we must grasp with positivity as well as urgency.	spk_212
Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-10-21	dail	33	Ceisteanna ar Reachtaíocht a Gealladh - Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_33	I raise an issue relevant to the climate crisis and our biodiversity emergency. It is about water quality in Dublin Bay, in particular. Will the Government provide a timetable for the introduction of an amendment to Statutory Instrument 79 of 2008, the bathing water quality regulations? On foot of a meeting I had with a great organisation, SOS Dublin Bay, we ask that an amendment be introduced to provide local authorities with the discretion to determine the bathing season for the purpose of monitoring water quality at beaches and swimming areas. We believe this is an important issue to ensure we move away from the highly restrictive swimming season definition, currently 1 June to 15 September, provided in the regulations. Local authorities, such as Dublin City Council and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, should instead be given discretion to ensure the monitoring of water quality all year around, where relevant and necessary. This would greatly improve our public amenity in Dublin Bay and biodiversity, and it would tackle the climate crisis.	spk_231

I believe I had just moved the adjournment of the debate and so had not yet had the chance to say that the Labour Party is happy to support this Bill. This Bill provides for amendments that might be described as somewhat technical but which are nonetheless important. They give effect to the Taoiseach's announcement of 27 June that certain education welfare functions performed by Tusla are to return to the Department of Education. This Bill will amend the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 to provide the Minister for Education with appropriate governance and oversight of the education welfare functions performed by Tusla following the previous transfer of responsibility for those functions from the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to the Minister for Education. We believe that, as has been acknowledged by all of those who spoke in the debate thus far, including the Minister himself, it is sensible for the Minister for Education to be provided with a direct line for policy direction and oversight of Tusla in respect of these specific functions related to education welfare. These functions cover issues such as the home-school community liaison scheme, the school completion programme and the educational welfare service. Tusla has stated that all three of these strands share the same national outcomes, these being improved attendance, participation and retention. These programmes might be described as not letting children fall through the cracks in education. That is very important. It was welcome to hear the Minister's words on the Bill and the purpose behind it yesterday. It would also be helpful to hear from the Minister, Deputy Foley, in the near future as to how she intends to take on these new functions, although it is clear these roles will still be performed by Tusla. I will address a number of themes that emerge from the Bill and its purpose. The first of these is the importance of smooth transitions in the transfer of functions and roles between Departments, including oversight of bodies such as Tusla by Departments. Upon the formation of this Government and the establishment of new Departments, departmental responsibilities were rejigged. That always happens after the formation of a government. Responsibilities move between different Departments. However, there is always a period of transition and this can cause serious difficulties. I have certainly been made very aware of this in the last few months by a number of constituents who have contacted my office because their children have effectively fallen through the cracks. There has been a difficulty in identifying which Department is responsible for the welfare, education or care of a given child. There can be interdepartmental issues in the case of, for example, a child with particular needs who requires support not only from HSE services, but also from Department of Education services. This can cause difficulties. The division of functions related to special education, children, disability and other responsibilities between different Departments and the transitional period arising from the transfer of significant functions between Departments has, on more than one occasion, resulted in no Department taking ownership of certain issues that arose. I have spoken with the Minister and other Ministers about particular cases in which this has happened. I acknowledge that there is a particularly big transition under way with the disability function being transferred, to a great degree, from the Department of Health to the Minister's Department. We are also seeing certain functions of the Department of Justice that relate to children and equality transferring to his Department. It is just something we all need to be conscious of. There is potential for gaps to emerge where such big transitions are taking place within the Civil Service. Everyone would acknowledge the importance of a smooth transition and of ensuring that there are arrangements in place that make lines of responsibility clear. Tusla is accountable to the Department of Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth and to the committee that works with it, a committee on which I now sit. With this new transition under the Bill, there must be assurances that duties transferred to the Department of Education will not go without scrutiny and that there will be a smooth transition. Perhaps the Minister might address how that transition will be managed? How are these new responsibilities to be transferred to the Department of Education? How quickly can it be done? The timing of transitional arrangements is also important. It is particularly important that we see arrangements put in place to ensure a smooth transition in this year of all years, when we have seen such an enormous impact upon children as a result of the devastating Covid pandemic. We know that, in September 2020, Tusla data showed that more than 12% of primary school children had missed more than the permissible 20 days per year. Given the prolonged closure of schools due to Covid-19 and the necessary restrictions associated with it, it is more important than ever to ensure that children do not fall behind or get lost in the system. Will the Minister speak further about the school completion programme? Does he anticipate it being affected by this change in designated responsibilities? How can we ensure that there will be a smooth transition? I will address the issue of the impact of school closures on children in some more detail. Recent reports have shown that some 4,500 students and young people did not return to school when they reopened following Covid-19 closures last year. There is no doubt but that contained within that alarming number are vulnerable students or students facing particular disadvantage who may have become really disengaged as a result of the closures and the great difficulties so many children and students experienced in having to work from home or having to be home-schooled. The term ""home-schooling"" was very much a euphemism. In many households, that was very difficult to achieve. We have seen research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the Economic and Social Research Institute and Trinity College Dublin, among others, which has examined the effect of school closures in Ireland and found evidence of a widening of inequality and of significant learning loss.We have all heard from individual families and constituents about the impact of school closures on their children, in particular children with additional needs. There have been some heartbreaking stories from parents about children regressing with slowdowns and delays in reaching developmental milestones, in particular children with additional needs. That is of real concern.  Research has also identified stresses on children arising from parental unemployment due to a loss of livelihood because of the Covid pandemic. As we now have a cautious return to workplaces, we will see more difficulties with parents and households trying to manage this transition.  While the Covid learning and support scheme is most welcome, we are concerned that it does not go far enough to ensure that those young people who are most at risk of becoming and staying disengaged from school and education are supported. Temporary increases in hours are not adequate unless backed up by ongoing investment. Budget 2022 could have taken the opportunity to expand the DEIS scheme, in particular, to include more schools which could benefit from the school completion programme.  In the debates on budget 2022 we said that instead of the €500 million in tax cuts offered by the budget, the Government could have made a radical change in our education system to make it truly free, tackle literacy issues and take more sustained and targeted action to tackle educational disadvantage. In particular, I and the Labour Party education spokesperson, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, spoke about our disappointment and frustration that we did not see more done on the catch up children scheme, which we have been calling for as long ago as February. We called for investment of about €100 million, which would be necessary to ensure we truly make up to children what they have lost out on through prolonged school closures, including the loss of educational and extracurricular opportunities, such as sport and other engagement in activities that would foster their development. We do not think the Government's funding is sufficient to ensure that there is adequate catch up, in particular for children who have been most severely disadvantaged. The funding allocated by the Government falls short by about €50 million. The funding allocated equates to just €50 per child to make up for over 18 months of disrupted learning. In the Netherlands, by comparison, €2,500 has been allocated per child. Even in Britain, despite all of the critiques most of us make of its current Government, there is an allocation of £1 billion for a catch up for children fund, equating to £85 per child. There has been research in Ireland on the effect of school closures and the need to ensure that we make up to children what they have lost out on. We have seen similar research in other countries. In Britain, the Education Policy Institute calculated that significant investment is needed to ensure that children do not fall any further behind.  We know in Ireland the enormous role education has played in the economic progress the State has made in the past 100 years. We know that educational disadvantage and inequality lasts a lifetime and is correlated with quality of life determinants such as health outcomes. We all know it to be true that investing in the education of children cannot start early enough. I have been to the fore in calling for a Donogh O'Malley moment. The Minister might recall that 55 years ago this year, the then Minister for Education, Donogh O'Malley, made the enormous and fantastic announcement that children would be entitled to a free secondary school place and that secondary school education would become free. At the time, this was seen as a very radical and unprecedented move because until then it was thought that children only had a right to a primary school place.  Just as that radical intervention was made, which became so significant in Ireland's economic and social progress since then and in our development as a nation, we now need to see free preschool education in the same light. We need to have the same radical intervention to ensure free early years places for every child are made available and that it is just a matter of course that all our children have access to the same educational and developmental opportunities in the vital early years.  I heard from constituents across Dublin Bay South during the by-election campaign during the summer about huge issues with the provision of childcare places and the scarcity of places. As we know, crèches and childcare providers have had to close during the pandemic. Many have found it unsustainable to remain open. Even where crèches and childcare providers have stayed open, the cost to parents of those childcare places has significantly increased.  I spoke on the debate on the citizens' assembly recommendations on gender equality yesterday and referenced an email I received from a constituent who told me a crèche in my area raised its fees on the day of the budget, the very day the Government announced a very welcome new funding scheme for childcare to be put in place from next September which would tie new funding mechanisms to a commitment that crèches would not raise their fees. That announcement, while welcome, does not do anything for parents who are now facing significant hikes in fees. It does not do anything for providers who have told us it is not sustainable to keep crèches open.  I spoke to the owner of a crèche in my area who would have liked to have stayed open, and desperately wanted to stay open. They knew they were letting down parents and children who rely on the service, yet they could not see a way to remain open. We have heard from professionals and staff working in childcare how unsustainable their position is. SIPTU's Big Start campaign identified serious problems with low pay in the sector and concerns about pay driving professionals out of the sector, which contributes to the difficulty in childcare services staying open. These are real concerns. We are failing parents and professionals and staff in the sector. We are failing providers with our current  The Labour Party, in particular Labour Party women, have been to the fore in promoting an equal early years campaign to ensure that we have a public universal childcare system in this country. That would have a game changing effect on our society. It would have the sort of effect the Donogh O'Malley moment had 55 years ago in guaranteeing children a place in secondary school. It would have an impact not only for our children, who would be guaranteed equality of access in early years to education and preschool, but would also have a transformative effect for women, men and gender equality in Irish society.  That takes up the theme we addressed yesterday in the debate on the citizens' assembly recommendations on gender equality. We know that in Ireland we have very low participation rates of women, in particular mothers, in the workforce. All of us know in our constituencies, and family and friend groups, that many women tend to give up work, or move to part-time work, because of difficulties with accessing and affording childcare. This, coupled with our gender pay gap of 14%, is driving women out of the workforce who may wish to remain in it if they were given the necessary supports to do so. This, of course, has an impact on gender equality.  I will conclude by saying that we welcome the Bill and will support it. It is largely technical in nature. We welcome the sensible moves it makes, but there is a bigger picture around the provision of supports for children, in particular those facing the sort of disadvantages Tusla and other State agencies are seeking to address and tackle."	spk_348
Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-10-20	dail	33	Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality: Statements	dbsect_19	"I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality.I listened with great interest to the Minister's speech. It is really good to see us having this debate. I was delighted to read the recommendations of the Citizens’ Assembly in April. What it has done in setting forward the 45 recommendations is present a visionary manifesto for change and for a society genuinely based on gender equality. The Minister quoted an open letter from assembly members in which they made clear their intent. It is inspirational and I join him in acknowledging the immense commitment and work done by the 99 citizens and Dr. Day, as chair of the assembly, in carrying out their task through Covid and adapting so swiftly to the move to working online. We in the Labour Party very much support the expeditious implementation of the 45 recommendations. They set out what is really a social democratic, left-of-centre and feminist vision for change on gender equality. Equality is central to the Labour Party's political philosophy and political belief system. I should also say we are very supportive in general of the citizens’ assembly process, as we were of the constitutional convention which predated it, the establishment of which was originally proposed by the Labour Party in government. I was proud to chair the Labour Party delegation on the constitutional convention in 2012 and 2013, the recommendations of which paved the way for the holding of the marriage equality referendum in 2015, among other things. It is a valuable deliberative process to have these assemblies established and maintained in this country. I wrote earlier this week about the potential for a new human rights culture to take hold in Ireland as we move through this awful and devastating pandemic. Assemblies like the Citizens’ Assembly and the constitutional convention are a way for us to move towards a new human rights culture in which the language of rights becomes more mainstreamed and accessible and we move to a new vision for rights that are not just first-generation civil and political rights but move beyond those more limited views of rights to a more substantial form of rights, that is, socio-economic rights which place positive obligations on the State to intervene to provide for greater equality. In that regard it is very useful to see what the Citizens' Assembly recommended in terms of the amendment of the Constitution. The Minister focused on those recommendations as well. The assembly’s recommendation to amend Article 40.1 to refer explicitly to gender equality and non-discrimination builds on similar recommendations made by other expert groups. We might reflect that the Constitution of the Irish Free State had a guarantee of equality that included the words ""without distinction of sex"", so it was more cognisant of gender as a ground of discrimination and the need to provide specifically against gender discrimination. That would be a very welcome amendment to include. The Minister asked specifically for the views of Members of this House on the second recommendation on amendments to the Constitution, that is, the recommendation that Article 41.2 be amended so the language would be rendered gender neutral. We might reflect on how extraordinary it is that in 2021 our Constitution still speaks of women as having a ""life within the home"" and of mothers as having ""duties in the home"". Not only is that absurdly discriminatory towards women and reflects, as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, has said, a perpetuation of gender stereotypes but it is also discriminatory against men, who do not have any recognition of their paternal role. We do not see any reference to fathers and that also needs to be changed. There have been many different formulas put forward for changing Article 41.2 and the Minister said he is well aware of the variations that have been proposed. We came close to the holding of a referendum on deletion of the very gender-specific language. What happened was, I suppose, a disagreement over what should replace it, if anything. From my experience in practice and taking constitutional cases, I would simply prefer deletion of the language. The problem is how one constructs a formula to recognise and support care and care work, as IHREC and the assembly again recommended, without setting up a hierarchy of rights. If we acknowledge the role of carers, what about the rights of those who are cared for? We must be so careful, in any constitutional reframing, about setting up hierarchies of rights. This is an issue on which we will, I hope, have more discussion and debate but it is difficult to see how we construct the very necessary recognition for care and the role of care in our community without creating difficulties. That is the real challenge. How do we recognise care in a way that is inclusive and not counterproductive? It is a debate we will continue to have. The third recommendation is a more straightforward one. It proposes we amend Article 41 to protect family life but with the protection not limited to the marital family. Just yesterday, the Labour Party published a new Seanad Bill to give entitlement for a widow or widower’s contributory pension for a surviving cohabitant in recognition of the glaring discrepancy in our law whereby we do not have recognition for cohabiting couples when one partner dies. That is a serious issue and was highlighted by the very tragic case of John O'Meara who lost his long-time partner Michelle Batey and who, because they were not married, was not entitled to the same supports a married surviving spouse would have been. Cohabiting couples account for 150,000 households, 75,000 of them with children. They are unprotected in the event of family tragedy like that which visited Mr. O’Meara. The Labour Party will also put forward a Dáil motion to change this. I call on colleagues to support the motion, which will call for an expansion of the definition of family in Article 41 to include families that are not based on marriage. It is very welcome that we have expanded the definition of marriage but we need also to expand the definition of family, as the Citizens' Assembly has recommended. I wish to refer very briefly to some of the other very important issues the assembly has made recommendations on, particularly those on women in politics. If I were to ask for two changes - and I notice the Minister did not commit to these in his speech - to ensure greater numbers of women participating in politics, the first would be to introduce a statutory right to maternity leave for women elected representatives, while the second would be to introduce quotas for local elections. Let us do that for the next local elections in 2024. A report I did for the justice committee in 2009 identified five ""Cs"" as obstacles to women’s progression politics, namely, lack of cash, an old boys' culture, lack of childcare, lack of confidence and candidate selection procedures. We sought to tackle at least some of those five Cs through the 2012 Act and the gender quota, which has been somewhat effective in the elections since, but we still see that the numbers of women Teachtaí Dála are very low by international standards. My election in July, as only the 37th woman in Dáil Éireann increased our proportion of women to 23%, so we still have a shockingly low level of women in politics. We need to see more positive action measures. The two changes to which I referred should be made. They are both key recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly. I will also speak in support of the assembly recommendations on childcare. It is unfortunate we did not see anything immediate in the budget to address specifically the cost of childcare for parents. I acknowledge the very important progress the Minister has made since taking up the portfolio and the progress we saw in the budget but it is still not working for parents, professionals, providers or, indeed, children. Just today, I got an email from a constituent in Dublin Bay South telling me the crèche their child was in had raised the fees substantially on the day the budget was announced. I know the Minister is proposing a new funding model and I very much welcome any move towards a universal public childcare system but it cannot come soon enough for the parents who are paying so much money for places that are so hard to access, as there is a scarcity of places too. The Labour Party has called for equal early years policy which would be a Donogh O'Malley moment to move us towards a system where every child in Ireland is guaranteed a free place in childcare. So much inequality stems from that disadvantage in the early years and we need to tackle that. As with so many of the 45 recommendations, the Citizens' Assembly has given us a very clear pathway for change in Ireland. It is a vision of change towards a society in which women and men are genuinely equal and we can say we are a society in which citizens and all of us resident in this Republic are truly valued as equal in our Republic. Unfortunately, that has not been the case for far too long. I see I am running out of time. I could say a lot more on the gender pay gap, which I am glad to see we are finally tackling, although again legislation introduced by the Labour Party some years ago on this issue should have been passed by now. We know that women experience poverty to a greater degree than men. We need to address the lack of socio-economic rights for women and men in order to achieve a truly equal Republic."	spk_350
Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-10-12	dail	33	Budget Statement 2022	dbsect_4	"I am glad to be responding for the first time in this House to a budget. I wish to follow the lead of Deputy Nash by approaching the budget in a constructively critical manner and welcoming what is positive in it while noting, however, that much of the positive change is so piecemeal that, although the budget has been largely and widely leaked in advance of its publication, with a drip-feed of selective positive piecemeal news, the reality is that it has failed to deliver. It has raised expectations without delivering any real change. The tax cuts announced today could have been invested in real and radical change in public services.What we have seen instead is a lack of a grand vision, some tinkering around the edges and a failure to address the real structural needs of people. There has been some good news in the budget for sure, for those who are perhaps cider drinkers or digital gamers. That is welcome. However, there is not so much good news for renters, or indeed, parents seeking to access increasingly unaffordable and scarce childcare places. This Government lacks a grand vision. What this budget lacks, and what Labour has proposed, is a new deal for a fairer and more equal Ireland and a new deal on care, climate, housing and work. This budget lacks a progressive pathway for delivering real change on these issues. On care and climate, the two issues on which I want to focus, as Deputy Nash stated, there is a lack of transformative vision. This is all the more a shame, given that we have come through Covid and we have seen what solidarity and a collective sense of purpose can deliver. We have seen the loss of so many thousands of lives to Covid and the devastation it has caused to so many, in terms of lives and health and also livelihoods. Through this time, we have learned the real value of public services and the need to ensure good, decent and adequate investment in our healthcare, education and childcare systems. That is what we mean when we talk about a new deal for a fairer Ireland. We are talking about the sort of moment we saw in Britain coming out of the Second World War, with the creation of the National Health Service. We are talking about the sort of transformative vision that was expressed by Dr. Kathleen Lynn in this country, when she talked about a new vision for children's healthcare, and that was exemplified by the former Minister for Education, Donogh O'Malley, when he announced free secondary education for all children 55 years ago, stating: ""We will be judged by future generations on what we did for the children of our time."" That is the sort of transformational vision that could have been delivered in this budget, but the Government has failed abjectly to do so. On care, we need to see a commitment to change to tackle the piecemeal,  I have called for a transformational moment in respect of childcare, which we are not seeing in this budget. Although it was well flagged that there would be much in it for parents, what we see instead is a disappointing failure to meet those expectations. A sum of €78 million is proposed in additional investment in core funding and to reform the national childcare scheme, which is below the €100 million that was flagged in advance. We have seen, in the words of the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, a promise of a turning point, but we have seen promises of turning points each year for childcare, without any tangible effect for those involved. We see some fine words in this budget, but no sign of any reduction in costs for parents who are now paying effectively a second mortgage in fees to crèches, with fees for children aged under five running at approximately €1,000 a month in my constituency in Dublin Bay South and throughout Dublin. There is also a lack of places. Therefore, it is not just affordability that is the issue; it is also a scarcity of places. I am hearing from providers in my constituency about the difficulties they have in keeping childcare services going. We are also hearing from those professionals and early years educators about low pay. Serious concerns have been raised about low pay in the sector. SIPTU's Big Start campaign and the New Deal for Early Years coalition are telling us that 42% of professionals are actively seeking work outside the sector now, with 78% saying that if conditions remain the same, they intend to leave within the next year. Low pay is the biggest factor driving people out of this profession. We are hearing from managers and providers who cannot recruit new staff and, therefore, cannot keep childcare services open. We are failing everyone. Our childcare system - or lack of one - is failing parents, professionals, providers, and most important, our children, who do not have access to quality early years education as a matter of right. That is why we need that Donogh O'Malley moment. We must ensure that children under school age who require deserve it, should be entitled to a free early years place in this modern Ireland. That is what we in the Labour Party have called for. I was proud to launch, with Labour Women, our call for a universal public childcare model, which we would have commenced in this budget, starting with a €60 million pilot. We would adopt a new approach defined by equality for children, affordability for parents and fairness for professionals. We put forward a clear and costed proposal of how this would be rolled out. It is built around the vision of a universal public childcare scheme. That is what is lacking in this budget. We do not see any commitment to a pathway to a future where there will be a universal public scheme. We do not see that absolute commitment to equal early years education provision for children in this budget. We welcome the changes proposed to the national childcare scheme. Indeed, my colleague, Senator Marie Sherlock, has led on that, but we do not see where it fits into the overall structural reform that is needed to fix a system that is failing everyone and is currently reliant on piecemeal private sector provision. Some questions remain. Why is it proposed to extend the scheme to under the age of 15 and how is that to be done? Why are we seeing such delay on the implementation of decent wages for childcare workers?  There is failure to meet expectations in the care and disability sector as well. As outlined in the recent disability capacity review, an investment of €350 million is needed in 2022 just to meet demographic and unmet demand. The additional funding of €105 million announced today is welcome but it is not enough to meet the serious needs of those with disabilities. The Disability Federation of Ireland has pointed out how increases in carer's allowance and the income disregard will not meet the needs of carers and will not help those carers who are not in employment. During the pandemic, we have seen how carers and front-line workers are unsung heroes who need supports. Not enough is provided in this budget. I welcome commitment in the budget to provide additional SNAs, but I know, from my constituency, just how short we are in terms of the allocation of places for SNAs in schools. Finally, on the catch-up for children fund that Deputy Ó Ríordáin and I have proposed, I do not see a commitment in this budget to ensuring that there is adequate resourcing put in place, particularly for those children who have additional needs and most need resources for catching up. On climate action, the budget lacks a sign of commitment to delivering a radical vision on climate. Climate should be front and centre. This should be a green new deal budget. That is what we had all expected, but again, the delivery in this budget fails to meet the expectations that have been raised. The UN Secretary General described the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that was published in August as a ""code red for humanity"". Indeed, the Minister for Finance himself said that the world is burning. However, there is no sense of that urgency, the need for immediate action or the grand vision to take that action when we look at the small print of this budget on climate.  We know that the political will is there. We see it in the school strikes for climate outside the gates of Leinster House every week. We see it the citizens' assembly on climate change, 100% of the attendees of which recommended that the State should take a leadership role and address climate change. It must be at the centre of policymaking in Ireland for all Departments. However, we do not see that in this budget. We needed to see plans for a more ambitious retrofitting programme and a commitment to a national recruitment campaign to ensure that we have adequate numbers of workers to deliver that programme. We also need to see more on just transition. We must ensure that income will be adequately redistributed for those who are going to be most hit by carbon tax increases. Labour called for a new carbon tax credit to be introduced to be refundable and allocated on a household basis and available up to a particular income limit and those living in homes of a BER rating of less than B2. We also called for increases in the weekly fuel allowance, and the announcement of such increases in the budget is welcome.We would have gone further and restored the extra four weeks that were paid in 2020. We wanted to see more expansion of eligibility for more households. Again, we did not see this in the budget. On transport, we called for a more ambitious programme and for free public transport for children and for all students instead of the half-hearted change we have seen. Certainly it is welcome to see reduced prices for those aged under 23. There is a question about how this can be rolled out logistically. We have a lack of public transport in many areas outside the major urban centres. It would appear that what we are seeing with the Government proposal on public transport is that it is encouraging people to use unaffordable, or sometimes unavailable, public transport before it can be made free to incentivise them to do so. We might call this putting the cart before the horse, or putting the Leap card before the bus or train where Leap cards do not extend or where there is no public transport available. The budget is short on completion dates for flagship public transport projects. There has been serious concern in Dublin about when the MetroLink will be rolled out. We should have seen front-loaded investment in active travel and city bike schemes. For years, I have been calling for the introduction of a bike to school scheme modelled on the bike to work scheme that would encourage more schoolchildren to purchase bikes for their commute to school and to move away from an over-reliance on private cars for that crucial school journey. The Labour Party delivered on the Dublin bikes scheme. We have seen strong public infrastructural schemes for cycling along the Grand Canal and in other areas in Dublin but too many infrastructure schemes are piecemeal. What we are lacking in the budget is a sense of a grand vision for a move away from reliance on private transport and a move to active travel and public transport measures. We need to ensure the infrastructure is there to enable people to make this move. Some of the changes proposed are simply inadequate. A measure refers to extending the €5,000 scheme for electric cars. Again, it is not enough to enable and support people to make the change and move to electric cars. We see a lack of provision for electric car charging points. This is a serious issue for people who actively want and desire to make a change away from fossil fuel reliance in their everyday lives. Overall, what we have seen in the budget is too much that is piecemeal. There is too much based on short-term thinking, of which we in the Labour Party have been critical. There is too little in terms of a commitment to the structural changes that are sorely needed in many areas, particularly in the crucial areas of childcare, care for older persons and care for those with disabilities. We have also seen tokenistic and piecemeal change put forward in the budget in many other areas, including climate, education and health, as Deputy Nash said. We are calling for a grander vision and a new fair deal for a fairer Ireland and a new fair deal for a more equal Ireland, in which the funding invested in tax relief is put instead into the delivery of high-quality public services. The budget we needed for 2022 was a budget that delivered real change for people throughout Ireland. This is not what we are seeing in this inadequate, flawed and under-ambitious budget."	spk_37
Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-10-07	dail	33	Fishing Industry	dbsect_37	I would like discuss the unsustainable mussel dredging on Irish coasts and the operation of SI 461/2021. I am raising this matter because it is something about which I have a particular concern. SI 461/2021 states that mussel dredging opened with effect from 14 September 2021. The statutory instrument provides that persons may fish for mussels between that date and 16 December next. The concern is that this statutory instrument is facilitating about a dozen large boats working around protected Natura 2000 site sandbanks in the Irish Sea and off Irish coasts. It is enabling them to remove so-called mussel seed from our commons and relay it into aquaculture sites. The seed then grows on the estuary with or without further dredging. It is often dredged up again for sale. The unique Irish definition of mussel seed, which, according to SI 461/2021, is mussels of any size as long as they are not intended for direct human consumption, allows big vessels to dredge up entire biogenic reefs wherever they find them. I understand from reading the statutory instrument that while a small number of sites are excluded from dredging within the terms of it, they are far few in number. There is serious concern about the impact this dredging is having on mussel beds and the broader issue of sustainable development. There is a wider issue about the need to halt unmanaged fisheries. Coastwatch and other organisations have tried for years to ensure that this practice be regulated and halted unless we can establish that it can be done without undue environmental impact. The real concern is that there is no mussel management plan and that exploitation of commercial shellfish without a species management plan or adequate impact assessment will contravene the marine strategy framework directive, MSFD, descriptor 3 requirements and have a serious impact on our biodiversity. Some years ago when I was newly elected to the Seanad, I raised a similar issue about cockle dredging at Passage East in Waterford. The then Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who had responsibility for it reversed the statutory instrument in response to the concerns I and environmentalists raised with him about the impact of big boats coming in and sweeping the seabed and destroying biodiversity and marine life. What is happening in this instance is quite similar. I am asking that the practice provided for in the statutory instrument be halted. I am not convinced that it is being done sustainably. There is no data to show it is being done sustainably. There is a real concern that these large, high-carbon-footprint vessels are dredging in and out of protected marine sites and that this is impacting on the biogenic reefs formed by mussels, which are crucial for the marine food chain and which form biodiversity hotspots in the sea. There is a real concern that substantial volumes of mussels have already been dredged up and that serious damage is being done. I do not have data on how many boats are active, but I have been told that there are 11 or 12. It should be possible to set the statutory instrument aside because of the assumptions that are being made or that it seems are being made on foot of it. These are unsubstantiated assumptions about mussel population dynamics. Specifically, the statutory instrument should be set aside because we do not have an environmental impact assessment and there is a real concern that we are damaging biodiversity at our marine sites.	spk_302
Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-10-07	dail	33	Fishing Industry	dbsect_37	I thank the Minister of State for his response. I am conscious that, as he said, mussel dredging is run on an all-island basis with Bord Iascaigh Mhara co-ordinating and providing a secretariat for the mussel boats, but I am told there is a difference in that in Northern Ireland mussel seed fishing grounds remain closed in 2021 as it was seen that there were not enough mussels. The mussel dredgers from Northern Ireland tend to come south to get mussel seed for NI aquaculture areas such as Belfast Lough. The Northern Ireland Government survey of summer 2021 states:These surveys have indicated the continued reestablishment of this once large seed mussel bed .... [This was a bed at Skullmartin.] We would therefore not recommend opening this bed at this time.Therefore, I think there remains a serious concern, despite the surveys the Minister of State has cited, that good weather has already facilitated intensive dredging over the recent neap tides and that substantial volumes of mussels have already been dredged up and damage done, both where they were dredged and where the dredged seed was dumped. Again, there is just a lack of information available on assurances about the environmental impact of dredging at this scale and this level will have. There is a concern also that the statutory instrument enables dredging based on assumptions that are not borne out by the reality, one difficulty being that mussel seed is so widely defined in the statutory instrument as to include mussels of any age or size under Irish law. During the recent by-election campaign, one of the issues I campaigned on was climate matters, in particular protection of the uniquely brilliant environment that is Dublin Bay. I represent Dublin Bay South. When we see this sort of wide-scale dredging being allowed under statutory instruments such as this one, it is important we question them and the environmental impact they have and look for environmental impact assessments.	spk_304

Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-10-05	dail	33	Childcare Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_15	"I am glad to speak for the Labour Party to support this motion and to have the opportunity to discuss this important issue. I have just come, as has Deputy Funchion, from the hearings of the committee on children, where we heard from a number of witnesses about childcare and issues facing workers in the early years sector. We heard from representatives of SIPTU and its Big Start campaign, and about how changes in the funding structures under the national childcare scheme has had an impact on after-school services. We were glad to hear from representatives from the Dublin 8 After School Alliance and Urlingford Community Childcare. One thing that all speakers had in common was that they all referred to childcare as being in a crisis situation. They all said that, through our lack of proper coherent vision for childcare, we are currently failing parents, staff, providers and, of course, children too. They said we are failing because we are not providing an equal service to all children, adequate rates of pay for professionals working in the sector, and, indeed, security for the provider. As other Members have said, we know parents face enormous costs in childcare. In my constituency of Dublin Bay South, high rates of fees are the norm. Approximately €1,000 a month is the norm for child and that is really difficult for parents to pay, as anyone can appreciate. We have heard witnesses say that Irish childcare policy for too long has been characterised by creative ways of stretching inadequate funding further. We heard there is a real danger that we will build on the current piecemeal provision. One representative from SIPTU described the occurrence of the financialisation of childcare and it struck me that we do not want our childcare system becoming financialised and commercialised in the same way we have seen happen in housing, with housing provision dominated by a number of big investors. There is a real risk in childcare, where there is a reliance on the private sector and piecemeal provision, that it will become financialised to the same extent and then it will cease to be seen as a public service. That is a real concern where we have a system held together by subsidies to private providers, where parents can barely afford fees and where there are such low rates of pay in the sector. We have the second highest OECD household childcare costs with couples spending an average of 24% of income, and single parents spending as much as 29%, on childcare costs. We know this has an impact on women, in particular. In Ireland, we have the lowest rate of participation of mothers in the workforce within the EU. We need to move to a different system of childcare in Ireland. On Saturday, I was pleased to launch with Labour Women a childcare policy calling for equal early years and a universal public childcare system based on three key criteria, namely, equality for children to ensure that each child in Ireland is guaranteed a place in early-years education and childcare; affordability for families whereby we move to a system with investment to ensure parents find crèches and childcare affordable; and fairness for professionals. The Big Start campaign has made it clear that early-years educators need to be paid a living wage. We very much welcome initiatives like the joint labour committee, but not enough is being done. I have received testimonials from SIPTU, from early-years educators. One described themselves as a single parent of two teenagers. They state:The low pay in my job has left me wondering how much longer I can stay in this sector. ... I presently work for 10.20 per hour, 25 hours per [week] ... I just finished my Level 6 in childcare and wondering now why did I bother.Rightly, we introduced higher levels of qualification requirements in the sector but we have not introduced higher levels of pay commensurate with those professional requirements.We must change that aspect. It is a crucial change addressed in this motion and one that we are also addressing in our policy in this regard. On a broader level, we need to move to what I have described elsewhere as a Donogh O'Malley moment. Just as when in 1966, some 55 years ago now, Donogh O'Malley, the then Minister for Education, introduced free secondary places for all children, we must now move to see early years education and childcare as a right for each child. We must move to a position where we can guarantee each child a place in early years education. I looked again at the visionary speech given in 1966 by Donogh O'Malley wherein he stated, ""We will be judged by future generations on what we did for the children of our time"". We will be judged for not having made sufficient provision for children of preschool age and for children of school age in respect of after-school childcare and support. We are again out of step in this regard. If we look elsewhere in the EU, there is much bigger spending nationally. Sweden, France, Denmark and Finland all invest more than 1% of GNI, which is the international target set by UNICEF, in the early years education sector. In Ireland, we are investing just 0.3% into the sector and this places us far behind the European average. We will be launching our Labour Party alternative budget tomorrow. It will seek to address the discrepancy relating to our low rate of spending in this regard. We ask that the run-up to this budget will see the Government outline how it will use this opportunity to move Ireland towards a universal public childcare system with a level of spending in keeping with the European norm. We ask the Government to replace the for-profit, market-driven, piecemeal model that currently characterises our childcare system with one that is State-led, universal and guarantees each child a place. We need a Donogh O'Malley moment or a National Health Service, NHS, moment in order to ensure that we move towards such a model and away from the existing type of provision in this area. Unfortunately, some Government innovations have had unforeseen consequences. This predates the Minister's time in office. I refer to the national childcare scheme introduced in 2019. We had powerful testimony concerning this scheme from witnesses who appeared before a meeting of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. That meeting was chaired by Deputy Funchion. We heard that some of the unforeseen consequences of the scheme have been a move to a work activation model from a child-centred model and from enrolment to hourly rates as the basis for funding. Serious consequences have resulted for community childcare providers and for children in those services. There is a real concern that equality of access is being hampered in that way. My colleague, Senator Marie Sherlock, took the lead on this issue and instigated the event held outside Leinster House earlier. I acknowledge that the Minister met with the community childcare providers. That was welcome. This issue is fixable. The providers that we spoke with at the committee meeting this afternoon asked all the members of that committee to ensure that this issue is fixed and that targeted interventions are reintroduced, if necessary, to ensure that children from particularly disadvantaged backgrounds are not adversely impacted by the changes to the national childcare scheme. Those consequences seem to have been somewhat unanticipated or unforeseen outcomes of the change to the funding model. The Minister addressed this aspect to some extent when he stated that the Government is moving to a new funding model. This is urgently required because we heard the community childcare providers saying that it is simply not sustainable to continue with the current model. We in the Labour party are supporting this motion because we believe in the need for a radical revision of childcare services and a move to a State-led, public and universal system. We must move towards such a system in other areas of care because we believe that there should be a continuum of care. As the term ""NHS moment"" suggests, there should be a continuum of care and we should have supports in place for all those who need them from the cradle to the grave."	spk_213
Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-09-30	dail	33	Climate Action: Statements	dbsect_32	"I am glad to contribute to this vitally important debate. The report from the IPCC in August warned us that we are at ""code red for humanity"". The UN Secretary General recently said that ""The alarm bells are deafening [...] Greenhouse gas emissions ... are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk"". We face a climate emergency, but we also face a biodiversity emergency. Just yesterday, the Fish and Wildlife Service of the United States Government declared that 23 species are likely extinct, including the ivory-billed woodpecker. The bird had previously been widespread in the south-eastern US. For anyone who is an insomniac like me and was listening to the BBC World Service during the night, a really haunting recording of the song of that woodpecker was played. It is possible now to hear that song only as a recording, because we can no longer hear the bird at first hand. For me, that really struck home. Reports stated, indeed, that the scientists from the Fish and Wildlife Service making the declaration became emotional when they described the impact of climate change and human behaviour on other species in our world. Therefore, there is real urgency regarding this issue. It is the sort of urgency that characterised the responses of governments around the world to the Covid-19 crisis. We do not, however, see that sort of radical response being characteristic of governments around the world when it comes to climate change. Governments must take the lead on this issue. What we learned from the experience of dealing with Covid-19 is that to tackle a crisis like an international pandemic, we must see strong action from states and governments. If any positive can be taken from the pandemic, it is that it has showcased the value of state intervention, collective solidarity and the public good. We are seeing that sense of the importance of the state and of public service reflected in recent election results. The Social Democratic Party, SDP, won in Germany. A similar party won in Norway. Three Scandinavian countries now have social democratic prime ministers for the first time since 2001. The same trend can be seen in the United States under President Joe Biden, where a $1.3 trillion stimulus package is being undertaken. There is a growing consciousness, therefore, of the need for strong government interventions and co-operation in respect of climate change. We all hope that will be evident in the intergovernmental talks at COP26 at the end of October. We also see a recognition of this new perspective in the recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly. They provide us with a manifesto on how we can tackle climate change nationally. In that assembly, 100% of the citizens recommended that the State should take a leadership role and address climate change through a range of measures, and that this must be at the centre of policymaking in Ireland for all Government Departments. It is crucial that we follow that blueprint and take that approach. In May 2019, Ireland became the second country to declare a climate emergency. Following that historic development, the now Minister warned then that declaring an emergency meant absolutely nothing unless there was action to back it up and that would mean the Government having to do things it did not want to do. Those were wise words, and such action is now needed. My party and I welcome the recent passage of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021. The legislation built on previous Bills. As a newly elected Senator in 2007, I introduced the first climate action Bill in the Houses, in collaboration with Friends of the Earth. We are all conscious, however, that these pieces of legislation are governance frameworks, but not ends in themselves. We must see a strong and robust climate action plan, coupled with a strong and robust national development plan, to ensure the necessary actions are taken to meet our climate obligations. Turning to the climate action plan, we are all conscious that the climate action delivery board, which is responsible for delivering the plan, involves all Government Departments. My question is whether it is adequately integrated into the Department of the Taoiseach and whether there is sufficient leadership from the centre of the Government and from the Taoiseach regarding what must be done. I wonder about that because we know from what goes into the climate action plans that a cross-departmental strategy must happen. I will give examples. We are asking the Government to work with the Labour Party on our National Standards Authority of Ireland (Carbon Footprint Labelling) Bill 2021. It is intended to place an obligation on the National Standards Authority of Ireland to define a standard approach to carbon labelling. Similarly, in the other House, Senator Ruane has drafted a companies emission reporting Bill to oblige companies with more than 50 employees to present the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment with an audited statement of their emissions, similar to the obligation in respect of the gender pay gap legislation. These legislative interventions and initiatives do not fall within the scope of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, but they are sorely needed to place additional responsibilities on the private sector. This illustrates the need for a joined-up approach involving all Departments. The national development plan must see a similar whole-of-government approach, led from the centre. We need an energy plan to ensure we are in a position to avail of our huge national advantages in respect of wind and current power. Offshore wind resources must be developed urgently. Turning to agriculture, we must ensure that agricultural strategy fits within and aligns with climate strategy. The Government must support sustainable activity in farming. We have strong examples of how that can be done. One project I visited and have long been impressed by is the Burrenbeo project in Clare. The Minister is aware of it. It is led by Brendan Dunford. It is an admirable example of how collaborative work between farmers and environmentalists can lead to strong outcomes for all. It is, therefore, in our national interests to be leaders on climate. Just as we led on progressive change with our marriage equality referendum in 2015 and our vote on the repeal of the eighth amendment in 2018, Ireland can also be seen to lead in taking radical action to tackle the climate emergency. We must build on the common purpose and solidarity that got us through the last year and a half to enable us to take this drastic and meaningful climate action. There are many concerns regarding our capacity to take this sort of radical action. One of those involves the recently reported delays to the rolling out of public transport infrastructure projects in Dublin. There is no clarity on the future of MetroLink, and yet projects like that are essential for us to ensure a sufficient move away from private car transport and towards greater reliance on public transport. I refer as well to the expansion of the national road network, while parts of the country are underserved by public transport. We also lack an updated national policy on the development of data centres, a topic we debated yesterday. There is a similar lack of urgency at EU level to pass the necessary regulation, which should come from a transnational perspective in respect of data centres, fracking and other aspects. I also point to the Government being unable to guarantee that there will be no blackouts during the winter and to ensure that there will be a sufficient number of construction workers to carry out an ambitious retrofitting programme alongside the necessary programme of housebuilding that is under way. I was proud to be at St. Andrews Resource Centre on Pearse Street yesterday for the launch of a new employment programme that will include a training course to retrain and reskill local people in retrofitting. That is the sort of local action we must take. The situation in which we find ourselves is overwhelming, but all is not lost. We should recall the message of hope contained in the IPCC report. It tells us that with meaningful and radical action we can do more than halt the current trajectory; we can also reverse it. Therefore, we need to see meaningful action being taken. We must see such action being taken on the circular economy, which the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, spoke about. We need to see strong measures on the right to repair, similar to the measure that President Biden introduced in the US. We must go beyond current EU directives on the right to repair and extend that right to include smaller household devices and to consumers. Issues also exist locally with cycling and public transport. I have called for the introduction of a bike to school scheme to give incentives for the purchase of bicycles for children to complement the bike to work scheme.  In Leinster House, we have had a conversation about parking and car parking for former and current Members. It is raining outside today and those of us who cycled in still have nowhere sheltered to park our bikes. I have been lobbying for such a shelter, and the Minister has supported me, as have other Ministers, but we still have nowhere to park bikes under shelter on the Leinster House campus. We see cars parked everywhere, but we do not see adequate facilities for the parking of bicycles. While that might sound trivial, it sends out a significant message to everyone regarding how we prioritise transport facilities. As the convenor of the all-party Oireachtas cyclists' group, I call for strong and visible action to support and promote cycling as an alternative means of transport in Leinster House as much as across the country. The Minister spoke about Dún Laoghaire and the strength of the measures taken there to promote cycling. It is welcome, and I hope we will see much more of that type of activity across Dublin and the country to encourage and to promote cycling. The fact that global warming is the result of human activity implies that a solution is at hand and that the means of addressing the climate emergency can be embraced by all of us. It implies that it can be done. I state that because being too doom-laden can cause people to switch off. It can be counterproductive if people feel there is no hope. Greta Thunberg and many other fantastic activists from younger generations urgently need us to promote a hopeful and can-do message about the types of measures that can be taken locally, nationally and internationally to address the climate crisis. I know the Minister understands that, as does his party. We in the Labour Party will work constructively with him from the Opposition benches, but we need to see more urgent, radical action on this issue."	spk_344
Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-09-30	dail	33	Planning and Development (Climate Emergency Measures) (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_39	I am glad to speak on behalf of the Labour Party in support of this Bill. I am conscious that this is the third time in two days that we have had the opportunity to have a substantive debate on climate and climate-related issues. It is a sign of the times and how pressing and urgent this issue is. In today's earlier debate, I spoke, as many did, about the IPCC report and the warning that we are at a code red for humanity. I also spoke about the crisis not only for our climate but for our biodiversity with the announcement yesterday by the US Government that 23 species would be declared extinct. We know that this is as a result of human activity and human behaviour. We know also that there is a need for urgent action and a common purpose internationally to tackle climate change, just as we have seen that international common purpose in tackling the Covid pandemic. It is a matter of harnessing the same commitment and the same solidarity. I hope we can bring a measure of that. In yesterday's debate on data centres we sought only a pause, as an interim measure, on the development of centres and that the Government conduct of a review of the environmental and economic impact of the data centres and of the context in which they are to be developed. That was a sensible approach to take, which the Labour Party supported. We spoke yesterday of the need for the Government to provide clarity as to the strategy for the development of data centres, in particular the strategy as to how to deal with the increased demand for energy that development of data centres would inevitably bring about. The question is how to power data centres. Can they be powered entirely from renewable sources? If that is the case, that is very welcome. I listened to earlier speakers talk about how technology has moved on. There is no doubt about that. The data centres that are being developed now are more energy efficient than those that were developed in the past. Again, there is no doubt about that. As I said yesterday, and as the proposes of yesterday's motion said, we are not against data centres. We understand and acknowledge their huge importance for our economy, jobs and for all of us. This is how we live now and we cannot roll that back.  In my own constituency in Dublin Bay South, there is a huge amount of tech investment in the community, as well as various employers. We are all very much conscious of that. At the same time, we need to see regulation of data centres. We need to see a coherent plan, in the present as opposed to the future tense, to see what the Government is proposing to do now to regulate data centres. What are we proposing at national level to ensure that they are carbon neutral or, indeed, that the increased demand on energy will come from renewable sources? Moreover, what is being done at EU level? I regret I did not get the chance to make the following point yesterday. Something that has struck me much more on reflection is how absent EU level regulation of data centres is. This is an international issue. If data centres are not built in Ireland, they will be built somewhere else. It is a global climate emergency, not just an emergency that we face here in Ireland. We need to have a transnational, EU-wide strategy and an international strategy on how data centres are to be developed, not just in terms of the huge demands they make on energy - we listed the enormous demand yesterday in terms of the figures we have from EirGrid - but also the demand they make on water supply in Ireland, as elsewhere. These are huge issues that we need addressed. As I said, we need clarity from the Government before we could proceed any further. That was the very sensible rationale behind the call for a temporary pause as an interim measure. The Labour Party supported the motion last night, as we support this Bill.  I am grateful to Friends of the Earth for outlining a number of concerns that I think would be addressed through legislation of this sort and that is why we are supporting it. There has been a good deal of talk about the immediate-term pressures on the electricity system in Ireland, particularly relating to the two gas plants that have been out of action. We have real concerns that comments recently from the Government and the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, indicate that we still be reliant on gas generation in the longer term, particularly with the increased demand from data centres and that this will, of course, impede our ability to meet our ambitious but necessary climate targets in terms of emissions.It is questionable whether we can say new carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings will be sufficient to prevent excessive demands for energy that will force us to fall back into fossil fuel reliance again. The crucial question we in opposition are asking is how can we see any roll-out of data centres without falling back into a reliance on fossil fuels. How can we be assured the increased demand will be driven by renewable sources? We must see regulation put in place to ensure that is the case. Again, that is absent both nationally and at EU level. The final point is, when we talk about investment in renewables, we are all conscious there is a huge amount still to be done here and that we need to see serious investment made in a whole suite of technologies. We see from Wind Energy Ireland an analysis that carbon pricing, storage and green hydrogen can eliminate the need for fossil fuels in electricity. It has some impressive and optimistic modelling about our ability to reach 85% renewable electricity by 2030 and 100% later in that decade, so that is doable. The IPCC report does give hope that with serious, substantive, radical action and intervention, we can reverse the effects of climate change and we can deal with and tackle the climate emergency. We cannot lose sight of that hope and optimism. Modelling from Wind Energy Ireland is indicative of that hope. However, we need to see the Government intervention that will actually give effect to those hopeful projections and optimistic modelling and, currently, that is lacking. We debated today the forthcoming climate action plan and we are holding these debates in the weeks prior to the holding of COP 26 in Glasgow. We are all hopeful we will see concerted international action, led by strong governmental actions across different countries. I think we are all very hopeful of that, but at the moment many of us feel we are just in a vacuum and what we lack is a coherent policy, a coherent plan and a present-tense statement of intent from the Government as to what will be done to regulate the development of data centres and ensure we meet our climate emissions targets in order that we will be able to move to that very important development of renewable energy sources to replace our over-reliance on fossil fuels. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for letting me in. I know the procedures on a Thursday evening are somewhat different and I am grateful to him for giving me time to speak on this important issue.	spk_510
Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-09-29	dail	33	Data Centre Moratorium: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_7	"I am glad to speak for the Labour Party in support of this motion and commend Deputy Whitmore and her colleagues on bringing it forward. I am glad to have the opportunity to debate the important and pressing issue of data centres in a measured, thoughtful and rational way. The wording of the motion is careful. It simply calls for a pause on the development of data centres and sets out very clearly and persuasively the reasons for doing so. When I took up the brief for the Labour Party on climate very recently and started looking into the question of data centres, what surprised me most was the absence of an updated national plan or Government strategy. To me this is particularly surprising given the projections of massively increased demand arising from data centres which others have spoken about. We have seen from EirGrid's analysis that demand from data centres could account for 27% of all demand in Ireland by 2029. Others have spoken about that. It is a staggering figure. Given that data centres' demand is predictable, and that we can project demand and demand is steady, it seems even more surprising that the most up-to-date Government statement on the role of data centres is from June 2018. We need a clarity of approach from government at a national level as to how the demand for energy from data centres will be managed. Having listened carefully to what the proposers of the motion have said, I note they have not said they are not opposed to data centres. That is a sensible point. That ship has sailed. We are all utterly reliant on data centres and global connectivity. We all accept how crucial the tech sector is for Ireland. In Dublin Bay South, my constituency and that of the Minister, we are all very conscious of the enormous contribution the tech sector has made. Taking a measured and rational approach, I would agree with the Minister that we need a plan-led regionally balanced approach. Policy and regulation are required to enable the transition to a zero carbon electricity system. What is currently lacking from the Government, both in the speech from the Minister and the Government's amendment to the motion, is clarity and a sense of how the growth of data centres is to be managed over the short and medium term. In his speech the Minister mentioned the publication of plans in the next month, but in the meantime we do not know what the position is. The wording of the Government's amendment states that it will set out ""a suite of actions"" and that the Government's statement on the role of data centres will ensure an ""alignment with electricity emission reductions"". We need to know how this is to be managed now. The motion calls for a pause in further development as an interim measure until the sort of crucial assessments that we need into the environmental, economic and energy impacts have been carried out. That sort of risk analysis seems a sensible and measured approach. There are two reasons that we need to support the motion and that the Labour Party will be voting for it. First, the motion recognises the demand on energy and, as we have said, the projected increased demand in energy demand as a result of the development of data centres. Second, the motion recognises the climate emergency within which we are all struggling with these issues. In terms of the demand on energy, others have pointed out that there are 70 operational data centres in Ireland. Most are concentrated around Dublin. It is the largest data centre hub in Europe. That is not something to be dismayed about because if they are not here they will be elsewhere. The climate emergency is a global one. We have to bear that in mind when we are speaking about data centres. As the Minister said, many multinationals have stated their commitment to transition to zero carbon power and carbon emission neutrality. That is all welcome, but we know, given what EirGrid has said today, that even where the energy that fuels data centres comes from predominantly renewable sources, as we hope it will, the demand still adds pressure to the grid. We are still reliant on non-renewable sources of energy, and demand becomes unsustainable without clear policy interventions and clear and urgent action being taken by the Government. The absence of an indication from the Government as to what that intervention will be is what the motion speaks to. It is also important to note that, as I said, demand from data centres will be steady. We can project what it will be, but that is all the more reason to have a coherent national strategy in place. It is not just about energy and energy demand; it is also about the demand on our water supply. We know that most data centres use a huge amount of water to cool their servers. In terms of the climate emergency, all present are very conscious of the fact that we are at a crucial juncture in the international movement to fight climate change. We are conscious of the IPCC report published last month. Tomorrow the Dáil will debate the upcoming climate action plan in anticipation of the COP26 conference in Glasgow at the end of October. There is a huge mobilisation of young people, in particular, many of whom were outside Leinster House last Friday. Many are anxious to see us take urgent action to address climate change. It is because of this and the Government's commitments that commit us to reducing our emissions and reach a 51% target by 2030 with a net zero-carbon emissions target for 2050 and to reaching 70% renewable electricity by 2030, that we know this is simply not compatible with the projected increased demand in data centres unless there is a radical and urgent intervention by the Government and a clear and coherent plan as to how this demand is going to be met while aligning us with those ambitious but vital targets on climate emissions reduction. To conclude, this motion simply calls for a pause. It is an essential interim measure to ensure that we meet climate targets and develop a sustainable policy on the location of data centres. It is crucial that we do this. We owe it to future generations, and to our young people who are out protesting every week, to do this. We are lacking currently from Government a clear strategy as to how this will be managed into the future. That is why the Labour Party is proud to support the motion. "	spk_80
Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-09-23	dail	33	Ombudsman for Children's Initiative on Eliminating Child Poverty and Child Homelessness: Statements	dbsect_34	"I commend the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, and the staff of his office on the publication of the A Better Normal report. It is a very important report and I welcome the opportunity to debate it. I am glad to hear the Minister will meet the ombudsman in the coming weeks to discuss the report. The report points to the need for urgent political and cross-departmental action and planning for children post Covid. In particular, it calls for the establishment of a cross-departmental time-limited joint Oireachtas committee to address child poverty and homelessness. I hope the Minister will implement that and that all Deputies will be able to join with him in implementing it because clearly this is an issue that requires a cross-departmental and whole-of-government approach, beyond the brief of the Minister and clearly encompassing the Department of Social Protection, Department of Education and Department of Health. That is clear from the report. Indeed, it is clear that is needed if we are to further the recommendations of the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures review by the Minister's Department. On the issue of poverty, the CSO has published alarming figures.The Minister stated that 8.1% of children in Ireland live in consistent poverty. The ombudsman's report points out that Ireland has missed its 2020 target of reducing by 70,000 the number of children in consistent poverty. In addition to that stark figure, we also know that the CSO figures show that 15.3% of children are at risk of poverty and 23.3% of children are experiencing basic deprivation. This really is a huge problem and failing in our system. Perhaps we might recall the words of the famous Irish suffragette and renowned activist on the areas of poverty alleviation and children's rights, Dr. Kathleen Lynn, who said her work was underpinned by a belief that ""every child was an individual and must know himself, or herself, loved"". The State should be guaranteeing this commitment to children by guaranteeing equality and a high minimum standard of living for all. I wish to refer to homelessness and Housing First, and then to education and where we need to do more to ensure that we are living up to the commitments in these reports and in the review of the Minister's Department. We know that fear of, and real risk of, homelessness is damaging our children at key developmental periods of their lives. Yesterday, we debated the Residental Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill 2021. We were glad that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage did not oppose that Bill. I have already contacted the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage to ensure that the Bill will be making further progress through the committee. We are most anxious to ensure that it becomes law. The Bill seeks to address security of tenure, affordability of rents and deposits and quality of accommodation for those in the rental sector. These are crucial issues for children in particular. We know that three in ten children under the age of 18 are living in rented accommodation, according to the recent census. Focus Ireland tells us that the biggest cause of families entering homelessness is the sale of houses by landlords, with vacant possession thereby ending tenancies. We need to stop this practice. I am aware that it is one of the aims of the Government's own Housing for All plan. The Government is seeking to legislate for tenancies of indefinite duration. Our Bill would provide for that and could, if implemented, play a huge part in addressing the real fear of eviction. It is the fear of eviction that we have heard, from so many individual constituents and respondents to our Labour survey, has such an impact. One respondent who spoke to us last week and who is renting a home from a private landlord, told us of her fears that her children might be without a home upon the impending expiration of the lease. Another spoke of her fear of the health impacts of staying at home with her children in rental accommodation with fungus on the walls and a serious damp problem. Children across Ireland are facing real impacts on their health and well-being because of poor-quality rental accommodation and fear of eviction. A Labour Party Bill introduced previously by my colleague, former Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, specifically sought to address the impact of homelessness upon children. The Green Party, when in opposition, supported that Bill. I ask that the Department, in collaboration with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, brings that legislation forward, because we need to ensure that children are protected against homelessness and the fear of homelessness. On schooling and education, the ombudsman has made recommendations in this area. Indeed, the extent of the recommendations shows the need for a strong intervention from the Department of Education on this issue and for a cross-departmental committee. In February, alongside my colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, I proposed a catch-up for children scheme. I proposed that the Government put forward €100 million to address the severe impacts upon children from prolonged school closures due to Covid-19. This fund, in addition to making up for lost education, would also seek to ensure children were caught up with on extracurricular activities, such as sporting activities and the arts, and, indeed, personal and social development. We know, in particular, that children who are vulnerable, living in poverty or have particular needs have suffered real set backs in their development because of the closures of schools and associated activities. We were most disappointed to find that the catch-up fund that was much more belatedly announced by the Minister for Education falls far too short of what we believe will be needed to ensure that children's development is not severely impacted on as a result of the Covid restrictions. As I have said, we support the Office of the Ombudsman for Children in calling for the establishment of a dedicated committee to address these issues, including issues around the impact upon children of Covid restrictions, poverty and homelessness. We must ensure that real, substantive actions are taken and that these are taken on a universal level for all children, not on the piecemeal basis that unfortunately has characterised far too much of Government policy on children and children's rights for too long. The UN International Day for the Eradication of Poverty is coming up on 17 October. We think that the Oireachtas should mark the occasion by demonstrating our commitment to ending poverty for children, in particular, by establishing such a committee, as recommended by the Ombudsman for Children."	spk_283
Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-09-22	dail	33	Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_8	"I move: ""That the Bill be now read a Second Time."" I will share my time with Deputies Kelly and Duncan Smith. I will take ten minutes and they will take five each, with the agreement of the House. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to introduce this important Bill which the Labour Party has drafted with particular input from our Seanad colleague and housing spokesperson, Senator Moynihan. I pay particular tribute to the Senator for her immense work and for her commitment to ensuring a strengthening of rights and protection for renters in this jurisdiction. This Bill is essentially about addressing what we and most reasonable people see as an existing power imbalance between landlords and renters. We want to address years of housing policy under this Government and the preceding Government which has favoured landlords and emphasised the use of rental properties as investments rather than as homes. We want to tackle that head on with this important legislation. I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I welcome the news this morning that the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is not opposing the Bill. We are glad to hear that and look forward to working constructively with the Government to ensure that the Bill's provisions are accepted and brought into law. This Bill represents a commitment I made during the by-election for the Dublin Bay South constituency earlier this year. During that campaign, I and all those canvassing with me heard from many people across the constituency who were experiencing difficulties and traumas as renters. I refer to really serious problems regarding security of tenure and fear of evictions, to unaffordable rents and deposits, fear of further increases and to poor quality of life and, in some cases, really poor conditions in rented accommodation. That is unacceptable in 2021. During that by-election campaign, I made a commitment that the first Private Members' Bill I would introduce would be a Bill to ensure greater protections for renters. I am glad to be able to abide by that commitment with my party colleagues and with the great assistance and support of Senator Moynihan. We want to tackle these issues not just for those in Dublin Bay South, but for those across the country. I am conscious that this is a particularly pressing issue in my own constituency of Dublin Bay South. The proportion of households who are in private rental accommodation is double the average. They represent a very significant proportion of those living in the constituency. Despite this, the problems and traumas those renting in Dublin Bay South face are replicated across the country. My colleagues and I will speak about some of the testimony we have heard from our own constituents.  This important Bill addresses three important issues in a range of constructive and positive ways. We look forward to working with the Government and with those of all parties and none to ensure that these provisions are accepted. The issues we are going to address and which I will outline were also identified in a recent report on housing published just last week by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI. That study highlighted the disadvantage experienced by many groups within the housing system and particular difficulties regarding the rented sector and the lack of rights and protections for renters. The stark findings of that report really emphasised the need to pass this important legislation.  As I have said, we are looking at three particular areas. The first thing we wish to do with this Bill is to strengthen protections against eviction for those who are renting. The legislation would remove so-called no-fault evictions. Importantly, it would provide for tenancies of indefinite duration. It would remove the ground allowing landlords to terminate tenancies on the basis that they intend to sell the property within three months and puts curbs on evictions for the purposes of refurbishment or passing the property on to family members. These are very important measures which would protect against eviction and which would provide significant additional protections for those renting.  We have heard from Focus Ireland - and I will speak further on this - about its concern, based on figures from the Residential Tenancies Board, that the main reason given in eviction notices currently being served is landlords declaring an intent to sell. Focus Ireland tells us that this is the primary cause of families entering homelessness. That clearly has a significant knock-on effect not only for those families, who face severe distress and trauma, but for us as a society. These are important measures which would have a knock-on effect in reducing homelessness. The second challenge we seek to address in the Bill is that of unaffordable rents and deposits. Despite the introduction of rent pressure zones in 2016, rents have increased by almost 40% in Dublin and by 20% elsewhere. In other words, rental costs have risen at a faster pace than mean earnings. Just yesterday, I heard from a constituent of mine who said that they have become a renter for life because they will never afford to get a mortgage. This person estimates that, after 26 years of renting in Dublin, they have paid more than €341,000 in rent. This person cannot save for a deposit and is therefore caught in this position. We are therefore really concerned about unaffordable rents and deposits. We have previously called for a three-year rent freeze. That is essential, particularly given the recent increase in inflation. There was a good deal of news about that yesterday. It is simply not enough to link rents to the consumer price index, although we supported the Government in doing that. It is not sufficient. We now need a much more effective curb on rent increases. I have spoken to constituents who tell me that their landlords are increasing rents by 4% because they can. That is a real concern. Our Bill would also declare the entire State a rent pressure zone and would cap deposits at just one month's rent, among other measures. As I have said, we also see a three-year rent freeze as an essential policy measure, although this is not provided for specifically in the Bill.  The third issue addressed by this Bill, which again mirrors a finding in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission report, is that of the quality of accommodation and conditions for renters. Currently, renters in Ireland face a whole range of different restrictive measures in their leases that prevent them from seeing their rented homes as permanent and that contribute to the enormous demand for buying houses and apartments. Many people want to get on the property ladder because they face poor quality accommodation as well as the fear of eviction and rent hikes. In other European countries, it is common for renters to be able to keep pets in their home and to request an unfurnished property so that they can move their own furniture and belongings in. Renting is therefore seen culturally as a more reliable, long-term and sustainable option for individuals and families. We have never had that approach in Ireland. It is time to change things. Our Bill provides for protections for renters and the right to rent properties unfurnished, and would also rule against an absolute prohibition on keeping pets in apartments and houses, among other things. It also provides for model tenancy agreements and for greater rights with regard to information and transparency for renters. For example, it provides for a public register to be put in place which would set out the number and length of previous tenancies and the rent paid and previously paid. It would also list the refurbishment and renovation works that purportedly led to eviction. All of these measures are essential if we seek to redress the current imbalance between renters and landlords. Again, to speak about my constituent's experience and the survey carried out for the Labour Party, we have heard from renters who describe experiences renting in Dublin and elsewhere as soul-destroying and terrible. Just yesterday, another constituent told me of a direct experience of leases containing a condition that tenants must pay a professional cleaner to have their rental properties cleaned before they can get their deposits back. In essence, this is an additional cost and will result, in many cases, in tenants paying hundreds of euros to get apartments professionally cleaned. I hear this is now a standard clause in many rental contracts. It is very frustrating for renters and a clear example of the serious power imbalance that prevails between landlords and tenants and that we are seeking to address in this Bill. The Government's measures to date have not been sufficient to address the specific concerns and fears of renters. As I said, we know from reports yesterday that with the rise in inflation, a three-year rent freeze is now essential as a specific Government policy measure. We also know, however, that the provisions in this Bill will provide essential protections for renters because, currently, they face a stark context. That is apparent not just to those renting but to everyone, from the parents whose adult children are living in bedrooms and boxrooms in the family home well into their 20s, and often their 30s, to those who are, as we say, couch-surfing and who are not officially registered as homeless but simply cannot afford a place of their own, even though their incomes are too high for them to be on a housing list. We need to ensure that renting becomes a long-term, viable and sustainable option for people in Ireland. We also need to ensure we have a cultural shift to move away from this vision of renting as always being in terms of a landlord's investment and income. We should instead skew our policy, rightly, somewhat back towards renters and the need to see rental properties as homes."	spk_48

Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-09-16	dail	33	Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill 2021: First Stage	dbsect_35	"I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2020 so as to provide for greater security of tenure and rent certainty for tenants, and to provide for connected matters.This is the Labour Party's Residential Tenancies (Tenants’ Rights) Bill 2021. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to introduce it. I have drafted this along with my Labour Party colleague and comrade, Senator Moynihan, our housing spokesperson. I pay tribute to her for all her work on this issue which is a very important one. During the Dublin Bay South by-election campaign, following which I was so proud and honoured to have been elected, we heard from so many people, renters and homeowners alike, who were so concerned about the difficulties everyone was experiencing in rented accommodation. These are widespread but they amount to difficulties in three particular areas, namely, difficulties for those who lack security of tenure because they are facing eviction or fear eviction, difficulties with unaffordable rents and rent hikes - even where people have been paying rent at a particular level for years they fear unaffordable rent increases - and third, difficulties with poor quality of life and low standards in rented accommodation, which again is a very serious and persistent issue for so many.These are the three issues that this important Bill seeks to address in a range of constructive and positive ways. They are also issues that were identified in a report published this week by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute. Their study highlighted disadvantages experienced by particular cohorts including those with disabilities, single-parent families, Travellers and others in the housing system, but there are widespread issues facing those who rent. Their stark findings underline and emphasise the issues that were raised with us during the by-election campaign and underline the need for this important renters’ rights legislation. First, we believe it is vital that we strengthen protections against evictions for all those who are renting. We know there remains a significant risk that homelessness levels will rise following the lifting of pandemic restrictions. We are also anxious that our homeless figures would include those in so-called ""hidden homeless"" situations, that is, those who are staying with friends or couch surfing and whose situation is not sufficiently recognised. The legislation I am introducing today would significantly restrict the circumstances in which evictions can be carried out or tenancies terminated. Among other provisions, we seek to remove grounds for so-called ""no fault"" evictions and we seek to ban the practice of landlords terminating tenancies on any grounds after six years of a Part IV tenancy. We are providing that evictions can only happen for renovation purposes where no reasonable measures can be taken to maintain the dwelling fit for human habitation. We are also looking to reduce the range of family members that a tenancy can be terminated to benefit. That is the first set of provisions which seek to address the security of tenure issue. The second challenge we are addressing in the Bill is that of rent hikes and the fear of rent increases that we have heard so much about from so many. We know that despite the introduction of rent pressure zones in 2016, rents have increased by almost 40% in Dublin and 20% elsewhere. To tackle this, our Bill would link annual rent increases to the consumer price index after a three-year rent freeze and would declare the entire State a rent pressure zone among other vital measures. The third issue we are addressing is that of quality of life related to quality of accommodation which mirrors the findings of the IHREC report. Particularly in Dublin, many renters are faced with very poor quality housing and a host of unfair restrictions that impede their long-term stay in accommodation and contribute to the enormous demand for house and apartment purchase. In other European countries it is common for renters to be able to keep pets in their homes, to air-dry clothes and laundry on a balcony and to request an unfurnished property so that they can bring in their own furniture and the comfortable things that they want to have around them in their home. This contributes to seeing rental accommodation as a longer term prospect for single people, families and households generally. In addition to the simple measures I have outlined, our Bill would require landlords to file a statement that the dwelling meets minimum housing standards when registering a tenancy.  We are keen to see this Bill debated and are hopeful that it will be debated in Private Members' time next week. Indeed, I made a commitment during the by-election campaign that if I was elected this would be the first Bill I would introduce and I am very proud to do so. I want to ensure that we are building on existing legislation and building in better protections for renters. People are tired of five wasted years of inadequate housing policy from the two larger parties in government and are weary of the continued failure to put forward an inclusive vision for homes and housing in this country. Renting must be seen as a long-term and viable option. It must be made an option that is much more attractive to people, and those who are renting must be given greater protections and rights. We want to address the power imbalance between renters and landlords and that is the key issue that we seek to address in this important Bill."	spk_301

Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-09-16	dail	33	Adoption (Information) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_47	"I commend Deputies Connolly and Pringle on bringing forward this important legislation and express my strong support and that of the Labour Party for it. I am glad to hear through the Minister that the Government will not oppose the Bill. As Deputy Connolly said, this Bill joins a number of other Bills, all with common purpose, which is to enable adopted persons to have access to the information that would enable them to see their original birth certificates. Earlier this year, the Labour Party brought forward a similar Bill, the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2020. It has a slightly longer Title but has the same purpose, effectively. It would have inserted a new section 86 into the 2010 Act, thus unlocking the information necessary to enable adopted persons to access their birth certificate upon turning 18. It would have made traceable the connection between an entry in the adopted children register and the corresponding entry in the register of births - a simple legislative device, yet one that has given rise to such difficulty over so many years. It is extraordinary that in 2021 we still have not been able to provide for this simple unlocking mechanism that would address the anguish and heartbreak of so many people who have been denied the right to their identity for far too long. There is also a Sinn Féin Bill that seeks to do the same as well as the Government's own Bill, the general scheme of which was published in May of this year and which is now undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny. There is a clear cross-party intent in this House and in Seanad Éireann, from all parties and none, to ensure that this important issue is addressed and it is to be hoped that this will be done in this Dáil term. Indeed, the Minister has made a clear commitment to do that. I pay tribute to the many individuals and advocacy groups such as the Adoption Rights Alliance, the Clann Project and others that have worked so hard to keep this issue highlighted and to ensure we do not forget the need for the rights of adopted persons to be recognised. This debate also serves to highlight the need to bring legislation forward.  It is useful to review what has caused the difficulties and to understand why there has been this blockage when there is clear cross-party intent. Many of us have worked over many years to try to address the perceived blockage. Many colleagues have referred to the constitutional argument that was used for so long by successive Attorneys General that the right to information was always trumped by the right to privacy - the purported or perceived right to privacy - of the birth mother. However, we know from so many different reports over the years and from the testimony of birth mothers themselves that many did not wish that secrecy to have remained in place and did wish to have contact made with the children they had given up in such different and repressive conditions over so many years. Their purported right to privacy has always been enabled to trump the right to information.  It was a source of deep frustration to me that during the previous Government term, between 2016 and 2020, we did not finally get to legislate for this. We came very close and there was a lengthy debate on it in the Seanad but ultimately a Bill that sought to address this issue fell in January 2020. We had tried to devise a system with the Minister's predecessor, which would have enabled the unlocking while providing for the balancing exercise that we were told needed to be done. The idea was give birth mothers an opportunity to come forward and register objections and if no objection was registered, then the way would be cleared to provide access to information. I am glad that we have moved beyond that and are looking at a much more straightforward right to information being provided in the Government's legislation. This is long overdue.  It is extraordinary to examine the legislation in neighbouring jurisdictions and other European jurisdictions in this area. Just across the Border in Northern Ireland anyone aged over 18 has had the right to a copy of his or her original birth certificate since 1987 and that right has existed in England and Wales since 1975. Long before that, in Germany that right has existed since 1957 and in Belgium since 1960. In some jurisdictions, those who are aged 16 and over have access to this information. Again, we must ask why it has taken us so long and emphasise the urgency of bringing forward this legislation now. I look forward to taking a place on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. That committee, chaired by Deputy Funchion, is undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny and I look forward to participating in that scrutiny. I hope we will see that done with all of the necessary speed and attention that it deserves. I am glad to hear the Minister's commitment to addressing the issue of those persons who were illegally or invalidly adopted and who currently have no accessible records. They have serious difficulties because they need access to files and not just to their birth certificate which, itself, is inaccurate or falsified. I have met many of those affected. Indeed, my party colleague, former Deputy, Joan Burton, was a strong advocate for those who had been illegally adopted and for adopted persons generally. She has gone on record to speak powerfully of her own experience. I would like to pay tribute to others who have also done so and to those who have given public testimony to their own experience as adopted persons, including in the documentary, ""Who am I? The story of Ireland's illegal adoptions"", which aired in March of this year on RTÉ. They spoke about their experience of discovering, in many cases as adults, that they had been illegally adopted and the trauma and anguish that caused them. They realised, as one contributor said, that their lives were built on a lie that they had been told. It is extraordinary to think that can continue and persist and that we still have no legislative redress for individuals in that position. We are all conscious of the history and of the shame and stigma that prevailed for so long. The Adoption Act 1952, the primary legislation on which our entire adoption system was built, enshrined and fetishised a secret and closed adoption system. We developed a secretive system which, in the words of a former chairperson of the Adoption Board, Ms Vivienne Darling, ensured that adoptees were ""kept in the dark"" as to their origins. Birth parents were required to make a fresh start and high walls of separation were built between adoptees and their birth parents. That was perceived to be a system that had public support. It is extraordinary that the Adoption Act has been amended eight times, but never have information rights been provided for and that closed and secretive system has prevailed and persisted ever since. I am grateful to Dr. Maeve O'Rourke and Ms Claire McGettrick who, among others, have done so much work in uncovering the shameful history of our laws on adoption. I have had the honour of representing many survivors of industrial schools and other institutions who endured horrific abuse. I represented many of them before the Residential Institutions Redress Board and heard first-hand their stories of their experiences of being failed by a State that long had a policy, over many years up until very recently, of simply incarcerating and containing children and women who were perceived as breaking social mores or not conforming to the State's morality of the time. I am glad we have moved beyond that and am grateful to so many who have moved us forward.  I will conclude by again expressing my support and that of the Labour Party for this important Bill and for the principle it enshrines. I look forward to working constructively with all colleagues to ensure that we finally address, in this Dáil term, the needs of adopted persons which is long overdue."	spk_385
Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-07-15	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_32	Go raibh maith agat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I thank the Tánaiste for his warm words last week following my by-election result. I am deeply honoured to be here to represent Dublin Bay South in the Dáil. It is a great honour indeed. Following yesterday's health committee meeting, I wish to raise the pressing matter of the proposed new national maternity hospital, which we might say is both a local and very much a national issue. During the by-election campaign the issue of women's health and maternity healthcare was raised with me many times. I heard from women who were due to give birth and who were deeply concerned about the ongoing unduly restrictive practices being adopted in many maternity hospitals and from partners of pregnant women anxious about their exclusion from labour wards. We urgently need to ensure better and more consistent provision for women's healthcare and maternity hospitals. In that context I also heard deep frustration from many people about the tortuous legal negotiations which have been ongoing for so many years surrounding the proposed new national maternity hospital. I heard about the many serious and valid concerns which remain about the ownership and the clinical independence of the proposed hospital. All of us absolutely accept the need for a new national maternity hospital. We agree it should be co-located with an adult acute service. However, without State ownership of the land on which the new hospital is to be built, valid concerns will remain about the clinical independence and the ethical governance of the hospital. We saw an all-party consensus emerge on this in the Dáil in the motion passed on 23 June. The key question I have is what the Government has done since 23 June to ensure that the hospital will be built on State-owned land and that these concerns will be met. We did not get an adequate answer on this at yesterday's health committee hearing. As someone who campaigned for many decades for repeal of the eighth amendment, I was so glad that in 2018, with repeal, we finally got to a situation whereby women here in Ireland could access the legal abortion and reproductive healthcare we need. However, that progress within our laws with repeal is not reflected in the negotiations on the new maternity hospital, especially, I fear, not in the structures around the Catholic successor company into which ownership of the site is to pass. I have called this syndrome whereby religious entities pass ownership of their assets into an ostensibly lay company the developer's wife syndrome, whereby we see male developers handing over ownership of assets to their wives or spouses in order that the legal liability will no longer attach to the person who holds the assets. My serious concern is that this legal device will be used in this transaction with the national maternity hospital and we will see a Catholic successor company continue to hold ownership even for a long lease. In the eyes of the church, 149 years is not a long time. I am deeply concerned, therefore, that without State ownership we will not have the clinical independence and guarantees that women will have access to all the services we need.	spk_199

Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-07-15	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_32	I thank the Tánaiste for the kind words and the response but it is simply not good enough to say the Government would prefer to own the land yet not be able to do something about it. We have a compulsory purchase order process. That should be used if St. Vincent's will not pass the land to the State. The question remains why St. Vincent's Holdings CLG will not simply gift the land to the State and why it is so anxious to retain ownership. Without a sufficient answer we risk simply sleepwalking into the default position we have had for so long with our education and health institutions in this State, whereby religious orders or Catholic successor companies continue to hold the long-term asset, the land, yet the State pays - in this case €800 million - to invest in a new building and the salaries and running costs of that new building, a building which will be on land which will ultimately revert into the ownership of religious entities or religious front companies.That is simply not good enough for women's healthcare in Ireland in the 21st century. That is why I am asking for clarity in regard to the State not simply preferring to own the land but that something urgent will be done by the Government to ensure the State will own the land on which the new hospital is to be built.	spk_205

Last week the Oireachtas passed the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Bill to provide for the linking of rent increases with the rate of inflation. Since then a number of cases have come to my attention and the attention of my colleague, our housing spokesperson, Senator Moynihan, of landlords issuing notices to tenants of rent reviews in advance of the new rules coming into effect. For example, a tenant has been given notice of a rent review to take place under previous rent-pressure zone, RPZ, limits and there are reports of landlords seeking to implement 4% rent increases, including from constituents in my home constituency in Dublin Bay South. Many renters have been in contact with me seeking clarity as to the legality of such a move. I ask the Tánaiste to confirm whether this practice is legal and whether guidance has been provided to the Residential Tendencies Board. Is it legal for landlords to serve notice for rent increases, which are not due to come in for months, above the rate of inflation to get around these measures?	spk_240

Ivana Bacik	53	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#IvanaBacik	2021-07-14	dail	33	Lifting of Covid-19 Restrictions: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_3	"I thank the Acting Chair for those warm words and all my colleagues who took the time yesterday, both inside and outside the Chamber, to wish me well. It was a warm welcome and I am grateful. I am told that I am the first ever Deputy to be sworn in while not in Leinster House. The convention centre feels very different. It was also stated yesterday that I am only the 37th woman in this Dáil and only the 131st woman ever to be elected to Dáil Éireann. Those statistics gave me pause for thought yesterday. I am proud and honoured to have been elected to represent Dublin Bay South. I thank and give all my gratitude to those who supported me, to my family and to my campaign team. I have thanked them all and will continue to do so. I am conscious that we ran a campaign which was rooted in the Labour values of equality, solidarity and fairness and which reflected a communitarian philosophy. We also tried to put forward a form of constructive and positive politics. It is in that spirit that I come to debate this motion in my first substantive contribution here. I was struck yesterday, while sitting through Dáil proceedings, that the manner in which debate is conducted in this House is different from what happens in the Seanad. There is a difference in culture. This is partly because of the gender breakdown. In the current Seanad, where I was proud to represent graduates of Dublin University, the membership is 40% female. This contributes to a more collaborative style of politics. Things are somewhat more confrontational in the Dáil because we only have a small number of women, namely, 23% of the overall membership. That is of interest to all who observe and have an interest in the parliamentary processes and democratic engagement. I want to speak in a constructive manner about the motion and to try to bring a reflective approach to it. I am concerned and dismayed by some of the language that has been used in respect of the critical issue of reopening, how we deal with the immense threat of the Delta variant and how we seek to balance risks as we move forward out of lockdown and try to provide a safe reopening. Yesterday, others raised the issue of extreme language, hyperbole and using terms like ""apartheid"" and ""Nazism"". These are utterly inappropriate terms when we are speaking about balancing risk as we move towards a safe reopening. I should have welcomed the Minister of State when I first began to speak. I know that her language was measured. It is the sort of measured language that we all need to bring to bear on this crucial issue and navigating our way out of lockdown to a safe reopening. I came of age in the 1980s in Trinity College. Kader Asmal was one of my most inspiring lecturers and he went on to become a minister in a post-apartheid South Africa. The word ""apartheid"" is one that we should not use lightly in any context. My grandfather was imprisoned by the Nazis in Czechoslovakia during the Second World War. For our family, fascism was a real issue. It is not a word that any of us should use lightly in this country or anywhere else. I will speak to the motion. For me and for Labour, it is about a safe reopening, balancing risk and moving out of lockdown in a measured way. Our concern is that there should be a range of measures deployed by Government as we move out of lockdown. We are concerned about and have been critical of the mixed messaging and lack of consistency from Government. We have been critical of the real potential for discrimination against young people that may form the base of the Government's plan to move to reopening. My Trinity colleague, David Kenny, described it this morning as an unfair, intergenerational measure to discriminate against those who have not yet had the option to be vaccinated. We would all be concerned about the impact that Covid and public health restrictions have had on young people in particular. I have called for a catch-up for children scheme for our children who missed out on so much through prolonged school closures and the loss of so much extracurricular activity. Deputy Ó Ríordáin and I have called for a catch-up scheme, which would help to ameliorate and address some of the awful impacts that Covid has had for so many young people. We also need to ensure that we provide safe spaces to socialise outdoors for young people who are out of school, that we offer other options and that we are not seen to discriminate in this way. Other speakers have talked about social solidarity. We have had really strong social solidarity through Covid. It has been a strength in Ireland. We have seen strong uptake of vaccines and an impressive roll-out of the vaccination programme. I am so glad to have been vaccinated. I got my digital Covid certificate yesterday. We should look at good models of practice elsewhere. Denmark rolled out Coronapas. It is not just about proof of vaccination there but also about rapid deployment of antigen testing. Denmark has a population of 5.8 million and the capacity to carry out 500,000 antigen tests daily. A key part of the Coronapas system is the use of rapid testing. The use of such testing means that system is not discriminatory against those who have not yet been offered vaccines, which is crucial. It enables people who have negative antigen tests to participate in indoor activities, matches and so on, as well as in indoor hospitality. That is the sort of model we are calling for and which Deputy Kelly and my party colleagues called for yesterday. We are anxious to ensure that roll-outs of indoor hospitality are done safely. We want to ensure that we do not fall foul of the Delta variant as we have seen in some countries that have had to close again following reopening. We have to be mindful that where we have seen failures or flaws in our programmes, it has been because people have felt left behind. They have felt that there is a lack of solidarity, for example, among over-60s. In the by-election campaign, over-60s felt left behind because younger cohorts ended up being fully vaccinated before them because of the issues with AstraZeneca. These are real concerns and they will undermine our collective effort as we come through Covid. For us, this is about balancing risk, coming constructively to this and looking at how we can support a safe reopening. We cannot see any more mixed messages, confusion and certainty. We owe it to everyone, younger people and those working in indoor hospitality, to come up with a clear way through this. That is what Labour is talking about. It is in keeping with our values of equality and solidarity."	spk_45

Will the Taoiseach and the Government be willing to support the Bill I have prepared along with my colleague, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, which is before the Bills Office and would provide protection to renters, tenants and those living in rental accommodation against rent hikes and evictions and would provide for a better quality of life?	spk_92
