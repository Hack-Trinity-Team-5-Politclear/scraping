This is a real-life impact. I received a message from one such apprentice and he said:Hi, I am an apprentice. I have been working for below-minimum wage as a plumber for the last 17 months. I am still waiting to go to phase 2 for over a year. I feel exploited since I have not been to college. I have been worked to my limits on a wage of €7.52 an hour. I have given all to my craft and I have had nothing but hardship given back but I continue to work hard every day.What is the Taoiseach going to do about it?	spk_207

Mairead Farrell	43	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2024-02-14	dail	33	Business Costs for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	An tAire Stáit and I both know the very real impact business closures are having across Galway. This is an issue we see in our cities, our towns and our more rural and isolated areas. In any local town, you will see the coffee shop, the butcher, the local grocery shop, the bars, the restaurants and the hotels. Any one of these closing can have an impact on the area. If we ignore the fact that these businesses are struggling and that businesses are telling us that they are going to have to close their doors, we do so at our own peril because of the impact these businesses have on their local communities, the vibrancy they bring to them and the job opportunities they create and because the amount of money in circulation increases when people are employed in the local area. One business owner in the Connemara area, a very rural area, contacted me to say that they are extremely concerned that they will not be able to keep the doors open until the summer. That is the kind of impact we will see if we do not take this crisis seriously at this very moment in time. Inné, phléigh muid an méid atá ag tarlú sa nGaeltacht maidir le cúrsaí pleanála. Dar liomsa, baineann sé seo ar fad le buninfreastruchtúr nó bunseirbhísí na Gaeltachta. Muna bhfuil daoine in ann teach a thógáil, a fháil ar cíos nó a cheannach, ní bheidh siad in ann fanacht sa nGaeltacht. Ar an taobh eile den scéal, muna bhfuil gnólachtaí agus an cineál seirbhísí sin sa gceantar agus muna bhfuil caiféanna, bialanna agus tithe tábhairne in ann fanacht ar oscailt, ciallaíonn sé sin nach bhfuil na bunseirbhísí sin ann. Dúirt gnólacht áirithe liom go bhfuil siad an-bhuartha nach mbeidh siad in ann fanacht ar oscailt go dtí an samhradh toisc go bhfuil siad ag streachailt an oiread sin. Tá sé fíorthábhachtach go n-éistfidh an Rialtas leis na comhlachtaí sin mar beidh sé fíordhona dá mbeadh orthu dúnadh.	spk_50
Mairead Farrell	43	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2024-02-14	dail	33	Recent Developments in Northern Ireland: Statements	dbsect_19	Cuirim fáilte roimh an bplé seo ach go háirithe ós rud é go bhfuil an Feidhmeannas tar éis teacht le chéile arís agus is rud iontach é sin dár ndóigh. Tréaslaím le mo chomhghleacaí féin Michelle O’Neill a post nua agus tá mé ag súil le feiceáil céard a bhéas á dhéanamh sna míonna atá le teacht. I welcome the opportunity to discuss this. It is particularly welcome that we are able to discuss what happened on Saturday, 3 February, and the fact that what happened was a very historic and momentous day. It was a day that many would never have thought possible, including many in my own family as well. To me, without question, the day really was a day of hope and of looking towards the future, and what might be. I congratulate my own colleague, Michelle O'Neill, on her new position as First Minister. It has been very clear from the get-go that Michelle will be a First Minister for all. We now need to ensure that all of the all-island institutions are up and running so that we can deliver a better future and a better Ireland for everyone. Teachta O'Dowd mentioned that we need to make sure that we are preparing for that future that I hope to see, namely, a united Ireland. He is correct that we need to make sure that we are preparing, and that we cannot see happen what has happened in other places, where referendums were run without preparation. That is why we have been always very clear on the need for the Government to have and to constitute a citizens' assembly to discuss that very future. I also congratulate my colleague, Conor Murphy, on his new post as Minister for the Economy. It is an extremely exciting time, specifically for the third level sector. I know he will have a strong focus on third level mobility for North and South and increasing cross-Border mobility, which is crucially important for our all-island economy and indeed for students' experiences going forward. I look forward to that.	spk_205

Bhí agóid taobh amuigh de Theach Laighean inniu le daoine a bhí bailithe ó chuile cheann de na Gaeltachtaí chun aird a tharraingt ar an gá le hathrú suntasach ar an mBille um Pleanáil agus Forbairt (Leasú). Tá siad ag éileamh go mbeidh a gcearta teanga san áireamh sa Bhille nua agus go mbeidh an Ghaeltacht lárnach sna comhráite faoin reachtaíocht. Faoi láthair, tá na cosaintí don Ghaeltacht níos laige sa Bhille molta ná sa dlí mar atá sé anois agus cheana féin, níl daoine Gaeltachta in ann teach a thógáil, nó a aimsiú fiú, ina gceantar féin. Mar gheall air sin tá siad ag mothú go bhfuil bánú ag teacht ar an nGaeltacht. An nglacfaidh an Rialtas le leasuithe chun tithíocht agus todhchaí a chinntiú do phobal na Gaeltachta? This relates to the protest outside the Dáil today in relation to planning, particularly in the Gaeltacht. Many people feel they cannot, build, buy or rent in Gaeltacht areas, specifically with reference to the Bill today.	spk_89

Ar ndóigh, tá go leor teaghlaigh sa cheantar faoi bhrú uafásach dá bharr mar tá 120 páiste ag freastal ar an seirbhís seo go laethúil agus ní hé seo an chéad uair go raibh ar bhainisteoir an ionaid é a fhágáil. Léiríonn sé arís eile go gcaithfimid breathnú ar an íocaíocht a bhíonn á fáil ag daoine atá ag obair san earnáil seo ar an gcéad dul síos. Chomh maith le sin, caithfimid breathnú ar sheirbhísí sa Ghaeltacht ina iomláine chun a chinntiú go bhfuil an tacaíocht ann do dhaoine a bheith in ann obair sa Ghaeltacht. Más rud é gur ar an luathoideachas atáimid ag caint ar, nó ar an dara leibhéil nó pé rud é, caithfimid a chinntiú go bhfuil an tacaíocht sin ann. Tá sé sin fíorthábhachtach, ach go háirithe má táimid i ndáiríre go bhfuilimid ag iarraidh go mbeadh teaghlaigh óga in ann a gclann a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht. Ar ndóigh, tá deacrachtaí eile ann mar gheall go mbíonn ar na tuismitheoirí taisteal níos faide agus iad ag dul ag obair toisc go bhfuil siad ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht. I thank the Minister of State for taking this Topical issue. This relates to an ionad tacaíochta teaghlaigh that has been open since 2009 and specifically deals with children from six months to 12 years of age and early education. I am sure the Minister of State has heard me speak about the issue of making sure that we have services in the Gaeltacht in the Chamber before. It looks like this service will have to close by the end of the month because the manager will be leaving and there are serious difficulties with recruitment. My colleague, Deputy Funchion, has long been raising the issue of ensuring there is adequate pay in the sector. I am fully aware of the things the Government has done in relation to childcare but I am deeply concerned about the impact this is having on the 120 children and their families who are dealing with this particular service every single day and the people working in it. To me, it is also about the services that are needed, whether in early years education or childcare. We see the same issues in secondary education, where it is harder to recruit in these Gaeltacht areas. If we are serious about maintaining the Irish language and people being able to raise these families in these areas, we need to address them. There is a deep concern now. The ionad has been on the go since 2009, but there have been issues continuously with managers having to leave. It is about providing supports for the early education sector.	spk_279

Mairead Farrell	43	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2024-01-31	dail	33	Research and Innovation Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_15	"Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire as sin. I am glad we are discussing the Bill in the Dáil today and I am also glad to see so many Members have indicated they want to participate in this particular discussion. As the Minister mentioned, I also look forward in the coming weeks to having that collaboration and looking at the Bill in even greater detail because, of course, we are hoping we will see from this a new departure for promoting research and development in this State and not just looking at a reorganisation of our two existing research funding bodies. I welcome the name ""Taighde Éireann"". It is a lovely name. As somebody who is very interested in the Irish language, I like the fact that it has such a strong name. I also hope that this merger does not have any unintended consequences when it comes to the distribution of funding between disciplines. We have had a very strong emphasis on STEM subjects and that is something the education committee worked on in great detail. We know that science, technology, engineering and mathematics are hugely important subjects, and ones in which I am particularly interested as well, but they are also subjects that produce research, the output of which is often more easily quantifiable in monetary terms. This arises from the production of intellectual property, industrial designs, licence agreements, copyrights and so on and these are key elements of any successful economy. However, we must also recognise that research in the humanities produces output that may not have an immediately recognisable monetary value but is no less important. This research is often essential to the construction and development of society and, therefore, these must be two wings of the two birds. We need to make sure we approach research and innovation with all of this in mind. One of things some of those who are engaged in science at third level often say is that we also need to look at the trealamh - this is what happens sometimes when science is done through Irish in secondary school. In English, this is the equipment that is there to makes sure that the people who want to study sciences and progress, who have great ideas and want to contribute to society here, have the ability to use the top-class equipment. It is really important that we see that level of investment in that regard as well. We will discuss the Revised Estimates in committee later but I think the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, is taking them rather than the Minister, Deputy Harris. I was reviewing the Revised Estimates for 2024 and some of the figures produced by the Department on the State's approach to research and innovation were quite interesting. The Department has not yet published figures for 2023 or provided a forecast for this year but I imagine that is probably due to Taighde Éireann being in the process of being established. It is worth highlighting that according to the European innovation scoreboard, our score in 2021 was 11, which then fell to six a year later. The Revised Estimates did not provide the figure for 2023 but I managed to locate this on the European Commission's website. It showed improvement last year but noted some ongoing weaknesses, which included research and development expenditures in the public sector; investment in environment-related technologies; non-research and development innovation expenditures; and enterprises providing ICT training and lifelong learning. The new Taighde Éireann body will not be able to address all these weaknesses so its establishment will need to be matched, of course, with our renewed focus within this Chamber. On the Revised Estimates, the last year for which the Department provides figures for gross expenditure on research and development is 2021 and in that year we spent as low as 1.5% as a proportion of GNI*. That is obviously lower than the expenditure of states such as Sweden, Germany, Austria, France, Belgium and so on, but it is equivalent to the likes of Greece, Poland, Hungary, Lithuania and a number of others and, therefore, we need to use this as an opportunity to state that we are taking research and development, innovation and so on seriously and put a renewed focus on it.  We have had a situation in this country for a number of years where intellectual property has been located here, which realistically has been a result of tax policy. However, that really means that the research and development was carried out elsewhere and domiciled here. What we need to look at now is upping our level of domestic expenditure because there are so many people with so many ideas as well and the Minister knows that from going around the different universities. We meet students who have exciting ideas and they see opportunities here that they wish to pursue. We need to give them everything in our power to be able to do that and make sure we have a very holistic approach. We also need to think of those who undertake this level of research and the institutions themselves that encourage this type of research. When we are looking at that and at these young people - older people too, people of all ages - who are potentially starting off in a career and looking at what they can contribute, one of those groups of people is the PhD researchers who have ideas, want to follow up on them and bring those ideas to fruition. One of the big issues for them is the rent, which is a significant overhead. I was just down in Trinity College Dublin where there was a protest about the cost of student accommodation. The message was very clear. What the students want now is reduced rents. Therefore, we need to look at the PhD researchers being included in the student renters tax credit as well. I understand that this falls under the responsibility of the Ministers, Deputies O'Brien and McGrath, but perhaps that is something the Minister, Deputy Harris, can raise with them. The tax credit in itself is not the be-all and end-all for these students who are paying extremely high rents but every little will help for them. We know that most PhD researchers struggle to support themselves. This is something that definitely should be looked at, particularly because those PhD researchers are the type of people that we will rely on into the future, providing the leadership in that research. Unfortunately, there is the issue of the unaffordability of student accommodation. It was very clear from the report that Trinity College Dublin Students' Union just did was that they are overreliant on extremely high-cost accommodation. This is particularly the case for international students who might be coming in to do PhDs or other courses and are relying on vulture fund-owned student accommodation. I might just touch on the continuation of the employment control framework, which means the continuation of high pupil-to-staff ratios. This is one of metrics by which Irish universities are ranked. I have a concern that it could drag our ranking down. It has also been flagged at European level that it infringes on university autonomy in addition to requiring them to continue the practice of using precarious employment contracts to try to circumvent the framework. I am sure the Minister has seen that IFUT recently produced an excellent report that laid out in stark detail the precarious levels of employment in third level institutions, which, again, is not helping those who are trying to provide research and innovation. The survey by IFUT found that almost 40% of respondents identified as precariously employed. Precarious employment in academia means many early doctoral graduates are leaving research. If we create a situation where talented doctoral graduates are then poached by universities in other countries, we will cut the legs from under ourselves. Finally, I want to flag the National Training Fund, which is something that is of keen interest to an awful lot of people in the sector. I have been trying to find out what is going on with the legislation underlying the fund because most informed observers seem to be clear that there is an issue where the fund is prevented from funding further training and skills. However, finding out exactly what it is is not straightforward. When it comes to the fund, the Minister's Department has a particular responsibility but the Departments of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, and Finance are also partly responsible. However, when we table parliamentary questions, everybody seems to be pointing their fingers every which way. Perhaps the Minister could make a commitment that he is going to get to the bottom of this once and for all. Universities have been calling for a fund to help them pay for laboratory and other research consumables. At the same time, not far off €2 billion is just sitting in the National Training Fund, which then gets invested in low-yield Exchequer notes. I cannot fully understand why that is happening. I have ideas but maybe the Minister could clarify that. It is high time for a move on it."	spk_166
Mairead Farrell	43	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2024-01-24	dail	33	Post-European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_16	I am very concerned about the escalating conflict in the Red Sea and the risk this could spill into a wider regional war. Every time we turn on the global news, we hear inflammatory rhetoric, with some political or military figure telling the audience we need to prepare for war with whoever is considered to be the supervillain at that time. Truthfully at this point, we have to ask ourselves whatever happened to diplomacy. Where is the EU in trying to promote dialogue and de-escalation? I cannot understand how the US and Britain can find the resolve to bomb Yemen but not to call for a ceasefire and an end to the genocide that is unfolding in Gaza. The Houthis say their actions were a response to the genocide in Gaza, so if we stop the genocide, perhaps we can also stop the blockade of the Red Sea, allow shipping routes to be opened, conflict to be decreased and the loss of more innocent lives in Palestine to be prevented. To most people, this seems absolutely elementary, but the British Prime Minister, Sunak, has said the UK will always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade. It would be welcome if it took a stand for international law and the freedom of the Palestinian people but, unfortunately, it seems to be another case of the strong doing as they wish and the weak suffering as they must. I again raise the issue of Julian Assange, something I have raised numerous times with the Minister of State pre- and post European Council meetings. What is happening to Julian Assange is an attack on journalism and the free press and I urge the Minister of State to raise this at the European Council meeting.	spk_169
Mairead Farrell	43	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2024-01-23	dail	33	Conflict in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory: Motion	dbsect_9	"One in every 100 Gazans has now been killed. The death toll has reached over 25,000. That is an absolutely terrifying figure. It is actually a figure that is impossible to comprehend but we have to comprehend it because we need to understand the scale of the loss and the genocide that is unfolding in Gaza. I know that, during an tAire Stáit's time as Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, he got to know my home county of Galway. I will use it as an example. It is like every resident of Athenry, Barna, Clifden, Moycullen, Oranmore, Oughterard, Portumna and Ballinasloe all being wiped out in a four-month period. That is the scale of devastation visited upon those poor Palestinians currently in Gaza. Yesterday,  We have all heard the genocidal statements made by Israel's Government. Its minister for defence declared that Israel was fighting human animals and that it would eliminate everything. The country's Prime Minister said it was fighting Amalek, the biblical tribe God supposedly commanded be completely eradicated. However, what the Irish people, including the hundreds of thousands of them who have protested against the genocide unfolding in Gaza, see is a proud but defenceless population of Gazans who are currently undergoing a genocide, a population that has long been starved, subjugated and stripped of their most basic human rights and dignity. One in four are now at risk of starvation. The entire population of Gaza is at risk of famine. Women are having to give birth through Caesarean section without anaesthetic, resulting in emergency hysterectomies and death. On average, more than ten children every single day since 7 October have lost one or both of their legs. Many have had to undergo amputations without the use of anaesthetic. What kind of cruel world do we live in that allows that to continue without the international community actively doing anything about it? This is a crime against a humanity and the shame of the world. I am shocked at this Government's lack of action. It was one of the first governments of a western nation to speak out but only a week ago the Taoiseach was ruling out actively supporting South Africa's case. There appears to have been some kind of shift in the Government's approach but only as a result of the public outrage at its lack of action or, perhaps, because another EU nation, Belgium, has now stepped forward to say it supports South Africa. I give credit where it is due to Belgium, but the latter is a former colonial power and it would have been far more fitting if we had been the first. We should have been the first and we should continue that support now given our history as the first western nation to oppose apartheid in South Africa. We can be thankful that Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh is part of the South African legal team. As a result, many Irish people felt that we were there in spirit. We are a signatory to the genocide convention and, as such, we are obliged to do everything we can to prevent the risk of genocide. Trócaire has said that this humanitarian disaster is without parallel or precedent. A week ago, the last remaining university in Gaza was levelled. Of course, it is no surprise that Israel is denying access to education just as it is denying the lives of the people of Gaza.It is trying to destroy their education.

Mairead Farrell	43	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2024-01-23	dail	33	Housing and Homeless Prevention: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_10	The issue of vulture funds snapping up family homes across this State is an absolute shame on this Government, just as it is a shame that over 4,000 children were in homeless accommodation over the Christmas period. The fact that this has not been mentioned every single day by Government Ministers in this Dáil since it returned is utterly shameful. Today, I was interested to hear the Taoiseach say he regrets that vulture funds are snapping up family homes. When one listens to those on the Government benches, one would almost think that they are not in government, and that they do not have the power to make changes to make lives better for ordinary families and workers. I remind the Minister that the Government does have such power. Deputy Varadkar is the Taoiseach and Deputy O'Brien is the Minister for housing. If they are not happy about it, they can do something about it. The only reason the Minister moved on this in 2021 was that there was public pressure and the Opposition was putting pressure on the Government. Last week, the Minister would have seen the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Harris, on student accommodation. The reality is that the announcement, which was made in DCU, was no more than a re-announcement. The student union was wise to the fact and clearly stated the facts in that regard. I will explain what was not included in that re-announcement. The Minister failed to mention the number of vulture funds which have snapped up purpose-built student accommodation. The accommodation funded by these vulture funds is simply and utterly pricing many students and young people out of access to third level education. We have seen in Galway, Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Carlow that purpose-built accommodation is totally out of the reach of ordinary students. We see that students are being priced out of the market when they look for a place to stay in order to access third level education. The Minister is the Minister for housing, so he needs to do something about it.	spk_254

That CEO has long retired, but I wonder what he would say if he was looking at rents today. Does the Minister of State know what the average rent was when the former CEO expressed that regret for the Irish people? It was €986 per month.In Galway, rents are more than €1,980 per month. Is it any wonder that vulture funds are trying to bulk purchase homes that are normally for families to buy? The real wonder is why the Government is allowing them to do this. I am from Mervue, a proud community in Galway. A lot of people who live in Mervue want to stay in that community and they want to be able to raise their families there. The reality is that the Government's policy is not letting them do that. We can take, for example, the Crown Square site, which is just beside our estate. It was to deliver 345 apartments but Galwegians cannot purchase these because they are build to rent properties. The other reality is that many people will not be able to afford to rent them because we know the kind of rents these funds charge. These are the consequences of the Government's actions. Never in the economic history of this State have so few created so much misery for so many people. It is not just people in Galway city who are affected but it is people across the State. It is also students who are truly impacted by this accommodation policy because it impacts student accommodation as well. I heard the Minister, Deputy Harris, making big announcements yesterday but the reality is that a lot of those were reannouncements. He was telling us about some new three-point plan he had when it was essentially the rehashing of an old plan. Not only that, but that old plan was also reliant on vulture funds. Not many people realise that vulture funds provide almost the same number of student beds as the universities. In Dublin they provide more than Dublin City University, University College Dublin and Trinity College Dublin combined. That is completely pricing people out of third level education."	spk_346

She said putting up her Christmas tree and putting the lights on it reminded her of the countdown to being evicted from that home with her three children. That decision is on the Minister of State. He is in the Department of housing. It is on him that this woman will be evicted. He could support this ban on evictions and make sure this woman and her family are not homeless over Christmas. There is nowhere to go in Galway city or county. Emergency accommodation there is at capacity. There is no room at the inn for this woman and her three children or the more than 150 children who are homeless across Galway city. I am dealing with a family with five children who have been in emergency accommodation for two years. Again, this is on the Minister of State. There is no room at the inn for the single mother with a two-year-old child who is couch surfing. This is supposed to be an exciting time for this young mother with her child.

The conditions required to deliver aid to the people of Gaza do not exist. If possible, an even more hellish scenario is about to unfold, one in which humanitarian operations may not be able to respond.We have been witnessing apartheid in Palestine for many years.

I am horrified to hear that visa was revoked for drawing attention to something that is obvious. There is nowhere safe to go in Gaza at this moment. We cannot allow any kind of fatigue to set in. We need to be as strong as possible because what the Netanyahu government wants is for people to turn away so that his government can force and continue to force Palestinians from north Gaza to south Gaza and continue to bomb then.

Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-12-05	dail	33	Renters: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_19	There are but the next speaker should be here in time. It has been said that there are only two certainties in life, death and taxes, but perhaps rising Irish rents should be included in that old maxim because here we are again. Whether it is the latest Daft report, CSO statistics, the census or, as in this case, RTB data, we are talking about rents rising again and again. At exactly this time last year, Eurostat detailed how, over the previous 12 years, average rents here had increased by a whopping 82%. One year on, the RTB informs us that average rents increased by 11.6% year on year. This is the highest annual increase since the RTB began compiling this data series in 2007. Galway city, where I live, has the unfortunate distinction of having the second-highest rents at €1,577 a month. Although it comes in second place, it appears to be closing the gap on first place as it had the highest average increase for new tenancies, at 12.7%. This is the devastating reality of the impact of the Minister's policies on workers and families. I see the pain, the anguish and the suffering this causes and that is why we need to listen to what is in this motion tonight. That is why we need to see a three-year ban on rent increases for existing and new tenancies and why we need to put one month's rent back in renters' pockets. Crucially, we need to look at affordable housing for Galway city because it has been left behind as regards affordable housing.  Young people have had not only their whole student experience, but their ability to access third level education, made far more difficult by this housing crisis. They are trying to live in cramped and overcrowded accommodation. I have seen several single beds in what looks like a hallway. People are also now couch surfing or commuting for hours upon end. How are they supposed to be able to do their third level education? A great many are dropping out because of the Minister's policies.	spk_391

These are widely recognised as having brought about the first nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Ireland was of course the first country to sign it. Frank Aiken, who was then Fianna Fáil's Minister for External Affairs, was under no illusion. He recognised and stated explicitly that it was our neutrality that was key to this. Our neutrality was not simply a side effect of a state that was a former colony. No; neutrality was at the forefront of a positive and constructive foreign affairs strategy. It is what allowed us to play the role of an honest broker for that treaty. I always knew that Fine Gael was not keen on our neutrality. To be fair to it, it was always open about that. I have to say, however, that I thought Fianna Fáil at least was different when it came to the issue of neutrality, but I was wrong. When the Tánaiste previously said that he would defend the triple lock, I naively thought he would be true to his word but again, I was wrong. This effort to whittle down our neutrality through a thousand cuts is there for all to see. It is absolutely insulting to the intelligence of the Irish people to tell us that our eyes are lying to us. It is an insult to say that all the NATO partnerships that have been entered into are not part of a long-term project to get on board.The Minister of State and the Tánaiste could have put this to a referendum if they wanted to do the decent thing. Instead, they are trying to smuggle through customs this effort to get us into this through the back door. A Sinn Féin government would look to enshrine our neutrality in the Constitution and to leverage our neutrality as part of a positive foreign policy which places peace and diplomacy at the forefront, rather than outsourcing our military decision-making to larger powers. Now is the time to strengthen our neutrality rather than abandon it.  Tá an chuma ar an scéal go bhfuil an Tánaiste náirithe mar gheall ar an bpolasaí neodrachta atá againn. Shíl mé go raibh Fianna Fáil agus an Tánaiste i bhfabhar an pholasaí neodrachais atá againn ach ón méid atá feicthe agam le roinnt míonna anuas, tá cuma iomlán difriúil ar an scéal. Tá neodrachas mar chuid lárnach agus mar chroílár an pholasaí ghnóthaí eachtracha atá againn sa Stát seo. Tá a fhios againn ar fad go gcreideann an pobal inár neodrachas. Fiú nuair a bhí na fóraim sin ar siúl ag an Rialtas agus an Tánaiste agus é ag dul chuig ceantair agus cathracha éagsúla, nuair a tháinig sé go Gaillimh agus nuair a chuaigh sé go Corcaigh bhí sé soiléir go raibh formhór na ndaoine i bhfabhar an pholasaí neodrachta atá againn. Feiceann muid fiú sna pobalbhreitheanna go bhfuil tacaíocht an phobail leis an neodrachas. Tá sé fíorthábhachtach go ndéanaimid é sin a chosaint. Tá agus bhí ról láidir againn go hidirnáisiúnta mar gheall ar an bpolasaí neodrachta atá againn. Tá sé sin feicthe againn sna Náisiúin Aontaithe fiú le gairid anuas. Mar a dúirt mo chomhghleacaí an Teachta Cronin, tá sé le feiceáil arís eile maidir leis an méid atá ag tarlú i nGaza nó sa Phalaistín faoi láthair cé chomh tábhachtach is atá sé go bhfuil guth láidir neodrach againn ag an staid seo. Ba chóir dúinn chuile shórt a dhéanamh chun é sin a chosaint.	spk_258

The stark thing that stood out to me when speaking to one particular business owner was that she said that this may not have happened before or it may not have happened to this extent before, but we know this will happen again and asked what can we do to ensure it does not. Her business was completely destroyed in terms of what had been there previously. That was something that was not expected and was not anticipated. This is only really the start of our winter season, of our storm season and of the impact it will continue to have. It is welcome that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, stated there will be a meeting between Galway City Council and the public representatives. One of the crucial things is to get as much information out to the public, specifically the members of the public who are impacted by this so that is welcome. He mentioned stage one, when does he expect that to be completed? I understand he mentioned mid-2023 at one point and I was not sure if it was related to that specific thing because it is the end of 2023 now. He also mentioned that a delay is caused by a shortage of specialist engineers. I assume he is working on trying to recruit those specialist engineers and I am aware of that. How many of those types of specialist engineers do we have at this moment across the State who can currently work on this? Are they specific to geographical regions or can they insist on other areas? 	spk_351

Moreover, the Department has acknowledged these schools need more assistance, because a lot of them are in DEIS areas.

Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-11-21	dail	33	Health Service Recruitment Freeze: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_15	In life, two of the most important things are health and housing, and both areas seem to be in perpetual crisis here. Indeed, most of the Government's actions actually seem to be making matters worse for people. A recruitment freeze in the health service at a time when the system is bursting at the seams is just simply incomprehensible. You would think that it would be a cost-saving exercise, but is it? Many within the HSE want to move away from using agency staff but this requirement ban is doing the exact opposite. That is not to mention the young people who are being treated as afterthought by the Government. The Government's idea of workforce planning seems to be getting graduates on an aeroplane to Australia as quickly as possible. I will tell the Minister the story of one young woman who contacted me. She is a speech and language therapist who was recently offered her dream job in a rehab hospital. Due to the demand she started the job in a temporary capacity, through an agency, while waiting for the contract. As this can take months in the HSE, she relocated to do so and then the job offer was withdrawn. As she had started through the agency before the freeze, she was allowed to continue to work, albeit with no job security. The HSE is now paying 30% more for her through the agency than if it had been able to honour the contract. As she said to me, nobody wins in this situation.  There are recent healthcare graduates who are wondering if this country does not actually want them. I was contacted by one woman about podiatry graduates in Galway, who were holding out for HSE jobs. They had done their interviews and were told that offers would become available because we are crying out for podiatrists in our more rural areas. They are now in limbo, scrambling to find private clinic jobs. As that woman said to me, the freeze will cause the brain drain of healthcare students. Ní dhéanann sé ciall ar bith nach bhfuil muid in ann daoine a earcú sa chóras leighis anseo, daoine óga atá cáilithe i réimse leathan ábhar agus atá ag iarraidh obair anseo in Éirinn, i nGaillimh agus i gceantair iargúlta ar fud na tíre ach nach bhfuil in ann mar gheall ar an mbac ar fhostú anseo, bac a chuir an tAire isteach. Caithfimid fís a bheith againn don tír seo agus breathnú ar an todhchaí, todhchaí na ndaoine óga sin atá díreach críochnaithe lena gcuid staidéar agus atá ag iarraidh fanacht agus a bheith lonnaithe anseo.

Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-11-16	dail	33	Science Week: Statements	dbsect_17	Today, we are celebrating Science Week. We are honouring the achievements of science and we are recognising the success of science and the progress that has been brought about by scientific research. I recognise that the Minister mentioned that we need to do everything we can to make sure that a career in science is available to everybody. This week, the education committee went on a visit to the Holy Family School for the Deaf in Cabra. It was a fantastic visit. We visited both the primary and secondary schools. In the primary school, we heard that first class were doing experiments every day of that week and that all the classes were looking at really celebrating science and participating in it . When we are looking at that, we need to make sure that we are doing everything that we can and to value those who are working in science. The Minister mentioned PhD researchers who are making invaluable scientific discoveries. We need to do everything we can for them and make sure we are valuing them as fairly as possible. As we know, those who are in their early careers as academics often have to endure quite precarious conditions in terms of their employment in third level institutions. We need to do everything that we can to keep people within research-based careers. Next week, in the audiovisual room, I will be hosting the launch of the recent report of the Irish Federation of University Teachers on precariousness in academia. To be frank, while we celebrate science, all the achievements and the fact that so many people are participating in Science Week, which is really important, we also need to make sure that we are aware of the difficulties and the issues, because the report does make for sober reading. We cannot have a situation whereby we value the output of scientific research without recognising the essential inputs which make scientific research possible. I have spoken to many students who are just beginning to pursue their scientific degrees. As we know, many students have had to go outside of Ireland because perhaps courses are not available. They might have to go to different places in the EU. There is also the issue of accommodation costs. The fees may be even higher abroad, but because the accommodation costs are significantly lower the net cost to the students is lower. I note that the Minister made a very significant announcement post budget in relation to accommodation to the effect that there is significant additional funding that could be made available for technological universities and other traditional universities, which will come from the European Investment Bank and will be matched by the Housing Finance Agency. As the Minister is aware, the technological universities have the difficulty and the issue around being able to borrow. It is something that needs to be resolved. Perhaps today the Minister might explain in greater detail that particular announcement. Of course, as with all announcements, the devil is in the detail. It is important to have that level of detail. We know that many of our universities already have significant borrowings, so it will be interesting to see how much appetite they have in relation to taking on more. I am conscious that I am constantly mentioning the issue of affordability as well. If we want to make this area better and we want as many science students to be able to stay here rather than having to go abroad, it will be essential that there is that affordability element. In relation to PhD researchers, we have had the publication of the independent report on stipends, which recommended an increase to €25,000. I am aware that there is significant variation in stipend rates across institutions. There are different categories of stipends, whether they are funded by Science Foundation Ireland, the Irish Research Council, its succeeding body or the institutions themselves. We will really need to look at the role the Minister is playing in relation to helping to implement the report's key recommendation on that increase to €25,000. Another issue that is impacting on PhD researchers is that they are currently excluded from the student rent tax credit. I do not fully understand how that has been able to happen. I have raised the issue directly with the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform. It seems to me that this would have been something that would have been good to tease out or figure out in the most recent Finance Bill. We know that PhD students are struggling. The Postgraduate Workers' Organisation of Ireland has been very clear with us in relation to its own demand and also the fact that many PhD researchers are struggling. There is the issue with taxation and as a result of that, they cannot access the rent tax credit. It is something that I think really does need to be looked at because it is an issue that has been raised with me. It is a missed opportunity and something that we can hopefully look at going forward. The other issue is the fact that many lecturers are struggling with the precarity of contracts. Many lecturers are on rolling contracts from year to year. It is an historic issue that has been going on for a long period of time. We know that almost one third, or 32%, are employed on fixed-term or hourly-paid casual contracts, academics are working, on average, 11 hours per week over their normal hours without additional compensation, and 61% of causal hourly-paid employees do not get paid for time between terms. Many workers on precarious employment contracts report elevated levels of stress and have considered actually leaving academia. I spoke to one man who works in the area of microelectronics. He trains people in very complicated areas related to the production of microchips and processors. He is extremely passionate about his job and absolutely loves research and teaching, but the fact that he cannot get permanency impacts on his life. Planning things like getting a mortgage and starting a family have proven very difficult. As a result, he is thinking that at some point he may have to make the decision to leave. If that were to happen, we would lose a knowledge base which can be very hard to replace. I want to touch on some of the other constraints in relation to research in our universities, some of which are from the last crash. For example, the issue of the employment control framework is one that is continuously being raised with me. Ireland has one of the highest ratios of students to staff in the OECD, yet thousands of employees in the sector are involuntarily and inappropriately on fixed-term, term-time, part-time, casual, if-and-when kind of contracts.Of course, universities' level of autonomy should extend to deciding what staff they need rather than having to consistently use all these creative contractual arrangements to get around this. Then there is the issue of the funding gap. I acknowledge that progress was made in this year's and last year's budgets. However, at a time when we are running surpluses and setting up new sovereign funds, we need to make sure we are closing this gap sooner rather than later. Since I mentioned the issue of the new funds, we should also look at the National Training Fund in the absence of any fund for university research equipment and consumables. It seems clear to me that the National Training Fund as currently constituted is not fit for purpose. Funds we could be using for further training and skills seem to be stuck in limbo. I am sure the Minister is aware from speaking to a variety of people that nobody seems to be satisfied with it. I struggle to see the benefit because it is not doing what it says on the tin or what it is supposed to be doing, which is helping to fund training on a national level. It is not earning much of a yield either. It is sitting in short-term Irish Exchequer notes. We seem to be incurring a major opportunity cost here. I am also aware of the Pact for Skills, the plan for 21st century skills. I believe the latest indication is that it will be late next year before there is any movement on this. Maybe the Minister could comment on that also. We only recently had the 2023 national skills bulletin produced by SOLAS. It identifies skills shortages in science, engineering, ICT, health and social care, construction, other craft, hospitality, transport and logistics. All the while, the National Training Fund continues to grow in size but not in significance. It is up to €1.5 billion but looks no closer to being put into the kind of productive use so many people are calling for. It is also time to consider a special purpose fund for university research equipment and consumables. These are key to scientific-based research and are major overheads for the universities. This is something the sector has been calling for. As it is not completely unrelated to the National Training Fund, has the Department given any consideration to this? One of the big issues the big universities are constantly raising is making sure they have state-of-the-art, modern-day equipment to make sure they can continue in the work they are doing. This is quite a significant issue for them. We all want it to be as good as possible and to promote innovation and science here. It is important to make sure we have equipment that is up to date. In the context of a united Ireland and greater North-South co-operation in research and higher education, I want to mention the shared island unit. That is not under the Minister's Department but the research it is funding, particularly the partnerships between different forms of medical research, is relevant. I hope we see more and increasing partnerships and collaboration between universities in the North and the South. I was recently in Queen's University Belfast where I met some people who have direct collaborations North and South. It is important this week that we recognise the achievements of Irish scientists wherever they were born on this island. It absolutely timely to celebrate all of them. Ireland has a very long and proud scientific tradition, having produced science which made great and historic contributions to the sum of human knowledge. Robert Boyle is often referred to the father of chemistry. Ernest Walton was a physicist and Nobel laureate. Then there are the great women of Irish science like Ellen Hutchins, the pioneering botanist and Edith Anne Stoney, who is believed to be the first woman medical physicist. There are many others, so many more than we could ever name here. In a week such as this, let us not just value the output of science. We need to make sure we recognise and call for the rewarding of those who make the inputs possible.

Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-11-15	dail	33	Imposing Sanctions on Israel: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	"""Everything in Gaza is upside down. It is hell to be honest. It is hard to find food, hard to find water. It's hard for everyone. I am lucky. I am so happy that I am going to leave."" Those were the words we heard this morning from Ayman Shaheen as he prepared to pass the Rafah crossing into Egypt. The hell in Gaza continues and, as we debate this motion, Israeli soldiers are raiding Al-Shifa Hospital, causing more terror and more hell. Al-Shifa Hospital is where premature babies died because the hospital's incubators had no access to electricity. Al-Shifa Hospital is where women have Caesarean sections with no pain relief. In that context, how can we continue to allow the Israeli ambassador to be here? War crimes are war crimes, no matter the perpetrator, and the hypocrisy is lost on no one when some of our European neighbours call out war crimes only when it suits their own agenda and not when they are committed by so-called allies. Not calling out Israel's actions as war crimes only weakens the calls when other war crimes are committed. The lives of all must be deemed equal, and the double standards must end. Ireland has been a strong voice in solidarity with the people of Palestine for a long, long time. Ours is a unique voice in western Europe, an outlier. Our voice, therefore, must continue to be strong. We are on the right side of history on this. Far more importantly, we are on the right side of humanity. In 2021, we were the first Parliament to recognise that Israel's illegal occupation was de facto annexation and, therefore, a war crime. We have seen many more war crimes perpetrated since, and we must refer Israel to the International Criminal Court. We have a moral obligation to do so. This year Sinn Féin brought forward the Illegal Israeli Settlements Divestment Bill, which, unfortunately, this Government kicked down the road for nine months. It must be enacted now. From the thousands of emails we have received today, it is clear the Irish people do not want to be stakeholders in the war crimes being perpetrated by Israel."	spk_31

This is a massive blow to the livelihoods of the business owners and the workers but also to the growing community that depends on the services these businesses provide. They need security and support, and they need both now. They need to know the Government is looking at a long-term plan to protect these businesses in the future as climate change worsens.

Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-10-25	dail	33	Neutrality: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	"At times like these, I hope people see the value of our neutrality and the ability of a small nation such as Ireland to have an outsized voice that can call for de-escalation, diplomacy and peace, even when larger powers call for greater confrontation, greater militarisation and further escalation. The Tánaiste's security forum has finished and its report has been produced. For those of us who support neutrality, its finding are just what we expected. The overwhelming majority of people support our status of neutrality. As regards the discussions, it was clear there could be no change to our neutrality as the people did not want change. Instead, therefore, it was discussed in the context of the triple lock, which was targeted. It was recognised that if that could be got rid of, it would be the thin end of the wedge. Since those discussions, however, things have changed. We see genocide unfolding in front of our eyes. Yesterday, French President Emmanuel Macron was in Israel and met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. President Macron told him he wanted to organise an international coalition to fight terrorism, just like was done in Iraq, which was called the ""coalition of the willing"". Only a day before that, we saw US Republican Senator Mitch McConnell say that the world now needs to confront a new axis of evil. Can people not see what is going on? Can they not hear the same lines that were peddled two decades ago? Have they forgotten that quickly the lies and the crimes of the war on terror? It seems to me it is a case of back to the future. I listened to Israeli Government figures say that they are waging a war on terrorism and that they will fight until victory - but what is victory here? It is the annihilation of a people. That is why we need to speak up for conflict resolution and for the just settlement of the Palestine issue and to promote peace at a time when the world is heading for a new war. We will be best placed to do that as a neutral country, as a country that many in the global south, in the Middle East and in the developing world look to and as a modern democracy, not a former colonial power. Neutrality is a force for peace, so we must protect it."	spk_25
Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-10-25	dail	33	Pre-European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_18	"In this day and age, it is very common to give out about social media; to say that it is no good, toxic or divisive; and to complain about misinformation and so on. A lot of that can be the case, but in this instance we need to give social media its due because without it we would not be able to see the horrors happening in real time in Gaza and the West Bank. We are not dependent on the likes of CNN, Sky News or the BBC to show us what is really happening on the ground because the Palestinian people can show that to us. They have been doing that and have been telling us their truth. At the weekend, I watched a video on Instagram of a young boy, Sami, who is only eight years old. He is an Irish Palestinian citizen. He attends a school in north Dublin. He spoke about how he missed his friends and teacher here in Dublin. He is trapped and terrified, along with so many children in Gaza. Any day could be his last. It was the last day for hundreds of children over the past number of weeks. In the eyes of the Israeli Government and the way it is speaking about children, it views children like Sami as combatants. In the eyes of the Israeli Government, he is guilty of the fact that Hamas was elected as a governing authority of Gaza in 2004, even though he did not vote because he had not even been born. In the eyes of the Israeli foreign minister, he is a human animal. Of course, he is just a little boy. Social media has also been helpful in other respects. It has allowed us to see the true colour of many. Yesterday, we saw the official Twitter account of the IDF taunt one of the United Nations foremost relief agencies when it warned that if it did not get fuel immediately, it would have to halt its humanitarian operations. What did the IDF official account tweet? It ridiculed it and told it to go and ask Hamas whether it would give it some fuel. Social media has also allowed us to compare and contrast the principles avowed by many political leaders. In some instances, we have seen how defence against aggression and occupation is declared a right and a cause worthy of celebration, but is not in other instances. The occupier's right to self-defence is considered the be all and end all. It makes me think of the quote: ""These are my principles, and if you don't like them I have others"". We need to call for a ceasefire because children like Sami are trapped in Gaza and many children like Sami have been killed as a result of this onslaught. At this moment in time, many people are in absolute desperation because they fear that there is no end to the onslaught in Gaza. I know the Minister of State is aware that we have a strong voice on the international stage in respect of this. We need to use that voice to say loudly and clearly that there needs to be an immediate ceasefire so that more children are not killed and we see an end to this genocide."	spk_181

I am not harassing the poor souls who write responses to parliamentary questions but I am a little bit confused. I submitted a parliamentary question on this issue because I am confused about the current approach. The response to a parliamentary question I received from the Department stated: ""The State contribution was €11,950 per student with the balance of fees payable by the student."" Different colleges have different fees. In UCD, for example, students pay fees of just under €17,000. Taking what the Minister has told me and what was stated in the parliamentary question to which I refer, surely the balance should be €5,000. That is clearly not how the system works because that is not what is happening. When it was first introduced, the purpose of graduate entry medicine was to open up the discipline to those people who would not traditionally have had the ability to study medicine. We also need more doctors to be trained."	spk_111
Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-10-19	dail	33	Third Level Education	dbsect_20	That confuses me in a different kind of way. I am not suggesting that the Minister is not outlining the facts but if the money coming from Government for fees is increasing, surely there should be some kind of conditionality that the fees charged to students decrease. It is my understanding that the fees will increase again next year. That is what students have told me. The reality is that the cost of these fees has a corrosive effect on diversity in the medical vocation. The cost of fees continues to make medicine and the studying of medicine a privilege. It is, of course, a privilege but it should not be something that is almost an elitist privilege rather than something that should be available to everybody.

The Ministers have taken their eye off the ball. The response I got after much pestering was that 7,500 were waiting. That is a significant number of people. We were just discussing student accommodation and we are aware of the housing crisis in general, not to mention the impact it is having on these people’s lives. The eye was taken off the ball and I could not get a response because nobody wanted to admit it. That is my reading of the situation.	spk_104

The response I got was from the start of September. This is really important. I know the Minister of State knows that but the eye has to have been taken off the ball. I do not see what else could have happened leading to so many people waiting. When we talk of increasing capacity in housing, the first thing the Government constantly says is we need workers who are able to do it. We have people who want to do it but cannot. They cannot access the training they need to complete their apprenticeships. I do not see how the Minister of State can say he did not take his eye off the ball.	spk_106

I am not harassing the poor souls who write responses to parliamentary questions but I am a little bit confused. I submitted a parliamentary question on this issue because I am confused about the current approach. The response to a parliamentary question I received from the Department stated: ""The State contribution was €11,950 per student with the balance of fees payable by the student."" Different colleges have different fees. In UCD, for example, students pay fees of just under €17,000. Taking what the Minister has told me and what was stated in the parliamentary question to which I refer, surely the balance should be €5,000. That is clearly not how the system works because that is not what is happening. When it was first introduced, the purpose of graduate entry medicine was to open up the discipline to those people who would not traditionally have had the ability to study medicine. We also need more doctors to be trained."	spk_111
Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-10-19	dail	33	Medical Research and Training	dbsect_22	That confuses me in a different kind of way. I am not suggesting that the Minister is not outlining the facts but if the money coming from Government for fees is increasing, surely there should be some kind of conditionality that the fees charged to students decrease. It is my understanding that the fees will increase again next year. That is what students have told me. The reality is that the cost of these fees has a corrosive effect on diversity in the medical vocation. The cost of fees continues to make medicine and the studying of medicine a privilege. It is, of course, a privilege but it should not be something that is almost an elitist privilege rather than something that should be available to everybody. There are more people studying medicine now but older people are trying to study medicine and find it-----	spk_113

Unfortunately, Galway is an excellent example of this. I have pointed out countless times in this Chamber that there are no affordable rental properties for those accessing the housing assistance payment in Galway, which means that people whose lives are based in the city are forced to move farther out in the county to find a place to live. In many cases, this means they need access to a car. I know of people who have been waiting over six months for a driving test in Galway. One woman I was dealing with, on having received a notice of termination from her landlord, spent months looking for somewhere to rent in a location with public transport links. She was doing driving lessons at the same time and when it came to booking her test, she was told it would be in 28 weeks. Now she is homeless and living in a room with her son in her parents' house. Another woman who is waiting on a driving test in Galway needs her licence so she can bring a family member to the hospital in Galway to attend cancer treatment, which can be physically and emotionally gruelling. The driving test date has been pushed back twice so far, meaning the woman has been waiting 30 weeks to take the test.It is clear we need to make sure the Government gets driving test waiting times under control.

We are told, and I have heard a few times in this Chamber, that even wars have rules. It cannot be the case that the breaking of those rules is okay for some countries. When the Israeli Government blatantly told us on the world stage that it would break international law once again, instead of outrage and horror, we witnessed Ursula von der Leyen telling Benjamin Netanyahu that the EU stands with Israel, apparently in our name. Well it is not in my name and not in the names of many Irish people. We stand with the ordinary citizens; we stand with the citizens of Gaza who have been described as human animals. When we see the breaking of international law and the cutting off of water, food and electricity to the people of Gaza, that is clearly a war crime. When we see the indiscriminate bombing of the people of Gaza, that too is clearly a war crime. It is also a war crime when we see the bombing of civilian infrastructures. If Gazans do not die as a result of Israeli bombing, they will certainly die as a result of the cutting off of water and of thirst, hunger and disease because of those war crimes. We have seen that the systematic killing is not limited to the ordinary citizens of Gaza. It also includes people who speak truth to power, including journalists who tell the world about the barbaric nature of the apartheid regime. We were united in horror in this Chamber when Shireen Abu Akleh was killed. We have witnessed the killing of more journalists. At that time, after the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh was forgotten, soon our lives moved on. The lives of the ordinary people of Gaza could not move on because they continued to suffer under the apartheid regime. We must, as Irish people and as Members of this Dáil, call for an immediate ceasefire. We do not have the luxury of saying we do not know what the people of Gaza are going through. We must be united in calling for an immediate ceasefire.	spk_217

Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-09-21	dail	33	Student Accommodation	dbsect_29	I thank Deputy Murnane O'Connor for raising this issue. It is quite interesting, particularly for the Carlow area. I am asking this question for my own clarity because I am new in this role. Something that comes up frequently with regard to the technological universities is the lack of clarity regarding borrowing and whether it will be on the Government balance sheets. Why are the technological universities not considered independent for borrowing purposes in the same way as other universities? Now that so many areas have the exciting opportunity of having a university and students want to come along, there will be greater pressures in terms of accommodation.	spk_180

How much more Palestinian land will be colonised? How much longer can international law continue to be violated and how many more Palestinians will be murdered? I recognise that the Government is a strong supporter of Palestinian people, but it is time we did far more. It is time we took the same kind of steps we did during the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. We need to progress the occupied territories Bill, put forward by my colleague Deputy John Brady. We need to cease delaying this Bill, which would require the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to divest from companies conducting business in the occupied territories. The Israelis are determined to wipe Palestinians from their ancestral lands, erase the memory of this proud people and supplant them with their own settler colonists. Well, we have news for the Israeli security state. I can do no better than quote the words of the late, great Palestinian American author Edward Said, who said, ""There is no getting away from the fact that, as an idea, a memory, and as an often buried or invisible reality, Palestine and its people have simply not disappeared.” Nor will they disappear despite the constant attacks and atrocities. They will struggle on until the day comes when Palestine gets to celebrate its independence. I look forward to that day."	spk_326

He was in huge distress because he had received an electricity bill for €939. That is a staggering amount, and completely unaffordable. Michael lives alone in a one-bedroom flat and is absolutely terrified to put on the heat or the electricity. He told me he has not put the heat on in months because he is so worried. I contacted the provider on Michael’s behalf. Its only suggestion was that he would pay in instalments. For a man of 82 years of age, that is completely unrealistic. He is already terrified of putting on heat or electricity and he sits alone at home with the lights off and no heating on. What am I meant to say to Michael?

Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-07-12	dail	33	European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_20	Julian Assange is on the verge of being deported and his more than 100-page long appeal detailing the sheer atrocity of his incarceration was not upheld. The response to it was just three pages long. It looks like he will be deported to the US. I shudder to think what awaits Mr. Assange. This is arguably the most significant journalist in the history of journalism. He exposed many war crimes and wrong doings and revealed more confidential documentation than anybody else. His work allowed many media organisations to piggyback on this and win major awards in the process. It made the careers of some of them. Most of these organisations and journalists have been conspicuously silent; when they have spoken, it has been meek and mealy-mouthed. We know why he was jailed and had to seek refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy. This was lawfare, a weaponisation of the legal system against someone who revealed inconvenient truths. In this day and age, we need truth tellers like Julian Assange. Recently we lost Daniel Ellsberg, who revealed the Pentagon Papers. He is often recognised as one of the original whistleblowers. He frequently held up Julian's work. He recognised that WikiLeaks and its type of journalism allowed a safe space for the release of public interest documentation that was confidential in nature. Julian will likely never live with his wife again, with his parents or with his siblings, and his children will miss out on precious years with their father. How can we talk about a free media when the world’s leading journalist is confined to a cell?	spk_264
Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-07-11	dail	33	Housing and Homelessness: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_16	The crisis in the rental sector and the housing emergency affect every part of our society. It affects every household and family. The Government always says that people want to rent and that they should have the opportunity to do so. There is one cohort of people who are really reliant on the rental sector, namely, students. Today I met with representatives of the Union of Students in Ireland. Its prebudget submission was all about housing. Of course the housing emergency impacts on students. It used be that groups of a few students in Galway could come together and rent a house but because of the housing crisis, that is long gone. So many young people are locked out of third level education because they cannot afford the fees under this Government or housing by any stretch. The Government’s solution to this is to build unaffordable accommodation. It tells us that it is bringing forward student accommodation but it is at rents that students simply cannot afford. The other matter on which the Government is focusing is digs. When I was in college 12 years ago, digs were an option. And it is a fantastic option, especially for first years going into a new place. But this is the Government’s solution. It terrifies me that there is no regulation or protection for students. Student after student, and student union after student union tell me there is no regulation. They say there is no notice period. I heard of one fellow having to leave in the middle of the night. There is no lock on the door so people can come in and out of rooms. Students have to leave their digs early on a Friday morning and cannot come back until Monday morning. There are all sorts of things. Digs are an important part of a housing solution for students but they are not the only solution. The Government loves to tell us it is prudent but it is giving a tax relief of €14,000 and does not even have protections or regulations in place for the students who are living there. It has to be sensible and workable for those renting out their rooms but there must be protections for students.	spk_393
Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-07-04	dail	33	Matters Arising in RTÉ: Statements	dbsect_15	I was reading RTÉ's vision statement earlier. It states:RTÉ's vision is to champion Irish culture by captivating audiences with trusted, engaging and challenging content; celebrating our country's rich diversity; and cultivating Ireland's talent.There are a number of parts of that statement that I want to focus on that situate themselves within the context of the current crisis in which RTÉ finds itself. I will focus specifically on those relating to the notion of trust and the concept of talent. All of these issues have been dealt with in the Oireachtas committees in recent days. We have seen them in the vast and growing array of media reports which have been circulating, some of course which RTÉ itself has been reporting on. I want to be very clear here: this is in no way an attack on the ordinary workers within RTÉ, whom we have seen are very angry because many of them have felt very badly treated in recent years. Neither are we against the idea of having a public State broadcaster. To me, that is an extremely important concept that we need. The idea of trust is very important. What we saw in a recent poll is that 70% of people felt trust could not be restored. Since I have come in here, we have seen scandal after scandal that has repeatedly caused issues for people and for the public's trust in public life. Those scandals really do have an impact on that. Then we have the concept of talent. There is nearly a perception that only certain people are talented; that the ordinary workers in RTÉ, who put on show after show and do all the work behind the scenes and in front of the cameras; do not have that same level of talent; and that certain people should get paid huge amounts - vast sums of money - while ordinary workers who put the show on the road week in, week out get paid very little or are on very obscure and difficult contracts. Tá easpa muiníne ag an bpobal as RTÉ mar gheall ar an méid atá tarlaithe. Feicimid an bealach ina bhfuil RTÉ ag déileáil lena gnáthfhoireann. Feicimid freisin an bealach a chaitheann sé leo siúd a labhraíonn agus a oibríonn i nGaeilge i gcomparáid leo siúd a labhraíonn agus a oibríonn i mBéarla ó thaobh pá de.

Tá sé sin fíorthábhachtach. I welcome the campaign group and thank its members for bringing their campaign here and allowing us the privilege of hearing them speak. We often have presentations in the audiovisual room but I have never been at a briefing there as touching and moving as the presentation I heard today when the Enough is Enough campaign group spoke. A number of things stood out to me. One was the impact that the road has had on every part of the community. When the campaign group was formed, those involved went into a meeting and noticed that many of its members were impacted by the road in such a devastating way that each family had their own devastating story to tell and share. That spurred them on in this campaign. My colleagues spoke earlier about the very moving story that Kate Corrigan told today. She described how her life was changed forever as a result of the death of her son on this road. She told us clearly that the work she is doing on this campaign - and I see from the passion of all the people who spoke that this is also true of them - is to ensure that no other family gets that devastating knock on the door and that no other family has to endure the pain from the devastating news she was told on that day. We know the reality is that far too many families have lost a loved one on the road. We have heard the numbers involved. The reality is that for every single one of those numbers, a family, friend group and community is utterly devastated as a result of that loss. The fact is we have the ability to transform this situation and these communities, to save lives by doing the work on this road. It would be unthinkable not to take the action that is needed. Earlier today, I had the opportunity to speak to a friend from Tyrone who explained to me the real impact of the road as she grew up. She said that as a child, she was terrified of the road because she was told how dangerous it was. That fear continues to this day. She is now an adult who drives that road and feels real fear when she is on it. I know the Minister of State understands this and understands its importance. One of the figures we heard earlier stood out to me. Every four days, there is a serious accident on the road. If we get this road delivered, we can change the situation completely. It is clear that the most important thing is that we save lives.	spk_247
Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-06-28	dail	33	Pre-European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_19	The issue of the ongoing process of EU reform is at the forefront in Europe. When it came to the fiscal rules, for example, Ireland was not vocal enough as a State. It was necessary for the finance committee to help drive a submission on it. Unfortunately, the new rules look a lot like the old rules. Although there are some new exemptions from debt and deficit considerations, mainly in defence spending, there have been calls, including from Sinn Féin, for exemptions in the context of climate and housing. Climate is a massive crisis we are currently facing and it needs to be faced on an EU-wide level as well as worldwide. As regards the exemptions for military spending, we know the impact wars have on the environment. That needs to be considered. The area of state aid rules and industrial policy is another that has long been in need of reform. At EU level, there has been talk of the need for renewed focus on industrial policy. That is particularly the case following the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act in the US and the rising risk of deindustrialisation in Europe. Efforts to encourage industrial policy have long had to accommodate a strict focus on competition policy and state aid rules, but in March the Commission adopted the temporary crisis and transition state aid framework, which has loosened the rules to prevent an exodus of green projects across the Atlantic. My understanding is that it grants the possibility to provide investment and even operational state aid for approved aid schemes to encourage a reduction in the dependency on imported fossil fuels. However, it also extends the possibility of member states setting up state aid schemes aimed at the decarbonisation of industrial production. That is welcome if it is used wisely. There are real opportunities here. When it comes to these key reformist discussions, however, the Government simply has not been vocal enough. It needs to prepare for this and get involved.	spk_180
Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-06-27	dail	33	Nursing Home Care: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_19	I listened to what the Minister of State had to say. She listed what she has done and provided but she must admit that what is happening at the moment is not working. We all know it is not working. We know that because the families are telling us it is not working. The families are telling us they are terrified about what will become of the nursing homes in which their loved ones live.Urgent action is needed to halt potential closures and drastically expand the capacity. Since 2020, 34 nursing homes have closed and that has resulted in losses of so many beds. We can all imagine the worry, the stress, the anxiety for the residents of homes and, of course, of their families. I will recount one of the stories I have heard and it is of the Garvey family and the concerns they have for their mother, Maureen. She has been a resident in Beaumont Residential Care nursing home. She is 90 years of age and has late stage dementia. She cannot speak for herself. She needs help with feeding, dressing and going to the toilet and her family are at their wit’s end with this. They are terrified that her nursing home could close and that they will not be able to find an alternative. It is not only the families who are raising these concerns but it is also the people who are running them and working in those homes. I have spoken to providers who just do not believe that they will even be able to see the end of this year. That would have a knock-on impact in respect of beds and jobs. I am very concerned about those more rural areas also and the knock-on effect that would have and whether nursing homes will be reopened in those areas. I completely understand the concern of families and of people who work in those facilities and who provide that care. We know that we have an ageing population and that we need to consider longer-term capacity. We are waltzing into a disaster zone on this issue.  I think of our young people who are being forced to emigrate because this Government will not put a roof over their heads but it also cannot do that with our elderly population.	spk_235

Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-06-22	dail	33	Apprenticeship and Further Education and Training: Statements	dbsect_30	As the Minister mentioned, there are currently about 67 apprenticeship programmes available throughout the State and the intention is to increase that further. I recognise progress has been made in recent years in expanding the range and typologies of apprenticeships on offer. That is welcome. My mother is from Germany and sometimes it sounds a bit clichéd when we reference the German apprenticeship model and other models, but that is only because it is something of a truism. Why would we not want to look towards those who have a good track record, use apprenticeship models for a whole range of different career paths and career choices, and utilise the concept of not having to do an equivalent to the leaving certificate because there are different types of opportunity out there for good jobs? Returning to this State, we have two categories of apprenticeship, namely, the craft and the consortia. The former are those most people associate with traditional construction, such as electricians, carpenters, plumbers and so on. The latter are the newer types that began in 2016 and offer broad opportunities in healthcare, biopharma, IT, HR, accountancy, finance, logistics, supply chains, sales, hairdressing, hospitality, food, etc. While are we are making good progress for this category of apprentices, we are not doing as well for our construction-type apprentices. Research published last December shows 30,000 additional apprentices are required by 2030 to help achieve the goals under Housing for All, climate action and retrofitting. As the Minister will be aware, we have not been reaching our targets in recent years. Much like our housing targets, our apprenticeship targets need further ambition and are failing to achieve the limited aspirations we have already set. We will not tackle the housing crisis without having the necessary construction workers, but I realise we are all aware of this. I recognise that additional funding is being provided this year. If I am not mistaken, an additional €13 million will be provided to increase the number of training places. I am interested in hearing how this will be tackled to address the various bottlenecks in the apprenticeship system, given that despite increases in funding and Government strategies to increase the overall numbers, there was a drop of more than 300 apprenticeship registrations last year when compared with 2021. I hear what the Minister is saying about the need to get schools on board and to get it out there that this is something that provides good jobs and is extremely valuable for our society when we are trying to tackle the likes of the housing emergency. Covid played a part, but there has been an issue with poor apprenticeship uptake since long before the onset of the pandemic. An element of that is due to the financial crash and the fact so many people had to leave our shores. We are still seeing young people leave our shores, including young people qualified in third level and in further education. Young people with qualifications of all the different types are leaving our shores. With the backlogs in accessing on-the-job training it is taking longer for some apprentices to qualify. As a result, they have a lower income for a longer period. At its peak in August 2021, there were over 11,000 apprentices waiting for their off-the-job training. I recognise that the Minister has managed to reduce that but it stood at almost 5,000 in December and today it is still above 4,600. We really need to clear this backlog. The majority of these apprentices are waiting to access phase 2 training, which occurs in the ETB centres. I have raised the issue with the Minister before of the need to attract qualified tradespeople to become apprenticeship educators. The ETBs will have told the Minister about the difficulty they have in attracting qualified people who can earn significantly more on the building sites. Those who do not want to continue on the building sites find other ways they can earn significantly more than they would working as trainers. I am sure the issue will be raised during the forthcoming public pay talks. That is a matter between Government and the trade unions. It will be interesting to see how it develops. There needs to be renewed focus at the level of our local authorities and the national development plan. We need to see more craft apprenticeship opportunities. I know from answers to parliamentary questions that the local authorities are making good use of consortia apprenticeships in things like accountancy and cybersecurity, which is welcome. We also need to see more craft apprenticeship opportunities in their capital sections. Each and every one of us will know how long it can take for vacant local authority homes to be refurbished and made available for new tenants. It is an issue that all councils struggle with at different times. It is a huge challenge for housing maintenance issues in my constituency at the moment also. Perhaps we could examine how apprenticeships might help reduce turnaround times. On the national development plan, a report in 2016 recommended that the Government should have social clauses in all public works contracts. They would place an obligation on contractors to create a certain number of apprenticeships when completing construction contracts above a certain value. They are commonplace in other countries but we do not use them enough in a strategic way in the public procurement process, despite desires to the contrary. When I think of the various infrastructure projects set out in the national development plan, there is massive scope for apprenticeship opportunities. I know from work I did previously that they are not frequently used and knowledge of the potential these clauses have is very limited. It is not just a matter of sending out information packs to different councils. It really requires a circular. There have been a number of announcements this week and in recent weeks which we need to see actively being followed through. We need to see the opportunities being made available, resources provided and targeted towards areas where there are bottlenecks. We know what they are. Accessing more trainers to deal with the backlog is something we could really look at as well, particularly based on what we are hearing about remuneration and competitiveness. The Minister mentioned the financial considerations for those entering apprenticeships, namely the fees and the sub-minimum wage rates. We all want to see more people able to come into apprenticeships. We want people to be able to get through their apprenticeships and go off and work. It has been raised with me on a number of occasions that young people feel trapped. They want to move on with their lives but cannot get the training they need to do so. They are on very little money. It is having a huge impact. All the societal problems we have, the housing crisis, the cost of living, all of that is going to have an impact on those young people as well.

Many students and people who went through university at that time know that these charges often increase and increase. I am a firm believer in having access to education for everybody, with free education for every single person who wants to access that education. Not everybody needs to go into third level education and it is important that we make clear to students the different options that they have. For anybody who wants to access third level education, there should be no barrier such as contribution charges or any other charges that limit their possibilities to access third level education or their ability to access whatever career path they want to take. They call it the land of saints and scholars. It should not be a situation where scholars can only be scholars if they have the money to do so. It should be a situation where anybody who wants to access a certain third level degree can do so and has the right to do so. At the moment, there are young people who are simply locked out of education. The reality is the Government recognises this. Last year, when the Government announced the €1,000 change in the student contribution fee, in a sense it recognised at that point that it was not fair. It recognised that we needed to do more for people to be able to access third level education. Well before the current cost-of-living crisis, I knew and many of us knew that this charge was wrong. At a time when bills, people's mortgages and even basic food supplies are increasing, then it is absolutely scandalous. The reality, which students are saying clearly to me, is that families need to be able to plan. They need to know, next year or the year after, if we have a situation where a child might want to access third level education, how they will plan for that. The Ministers know that decreasing student fees allows more young people to access third level education. It is not just the charges that have an impact on that. We know, from the Dublin City University report on housing that it is an additional barrier to education. It states that an average of €750 is not reasonable or realistic for many young people. We can all agree that what is needed is a situation whereby every single young person who wants to access third level education can do so and can access the course he or she wants to. Not only is that better for us as the so-called land of saints and scholars, but it is better for long-term workforce planning. Tá rud amháin atáim chun a rá inniu.

Ar ndóigh, tá rudaí eile gur féidir le daoine óga a dhéanamh agus tá sé fíorthábhachtach go bhfuil an t-eolas sin acu ach ba chóir go mbeadh deis ag aon pháiste beo atá ag iarraidh dul ar an ollscoil dul agus foghlaim cibé rud gur mhaith leis nó léi a fhoghlaim. Ba chóir go mbeadh daoine óga in ann a rá leo féin go bhfuil siad ag iarraidh a bheith ina léachtóir, ina ndochtúir nó ina n-altra agus é sin ar fad a dhéanamh. Ní cóir nach mbeadh sé de dheis acu é sin a dhéanamh mar gheall nach bhfuil an t-airgead acu. I think we are all in agreement that we need to make sure that everybody has access to third level education who wants it.	spk_165
Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-06-14	dail	33	National Minimum Wage (Equal Pay for Young Workers) Bill 2022: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I commend Deputy Paul Murphy and People Before Profit on bringing forward this Bill. It has always struck me as completely and utterly unfair that young workers, those under the age of 20, have a lower rate of the minimum wage. A 19-year-old, for example, will earn just 90% of the minimum wage. An 18-year-old will only earn 80% of the minimum wage and a 17-year-old will receive just 70% of the minimum wage, which works out as €7.91 per hour. How has this situation been allowed to persist for as long as it has? On a related point, it was not so long ago that we had a substantial report from the Commission on Pensions. It stressed the need to promote and protect intergenerational equity. This means not only fairness within generations but between different generations. That was obviously in the context of planning for workers' retirements. Contrast that report's stated aim with the very real pay inequality which persists for young workers today. Where is the intergenerational equity for those people? I cannot see it and I am sure the Minister of State cannot see it either. It has been five years since Sinn Féin first introduced legislation to end this unequal and discriminatory practice. These exploitative sub-minimum wage pay rates have now been ended in the likes of Germany, Spain, Belgium and Canada. The list goes on. The Minister of State will have seen that the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, recently produced its housing report at an event in Dublin City University, DCU. It stated that students are paying an average of €750 for rent every month. Imagine an 18-year-old who has just entered college. The student needs to work to cover rent but obviously cannot work a standard 40-hour work because he or she needs to attend class and tutorials, sit examinations, complete assignments and prepare, etc. Let us assume the student works half that amount. This 18-year-old could be earning €9.04 per hour. After one month, he or she would have earned just over €720, which is not even enough to cover the average student rent. The student would still have an average shortfall of €30. What should such students do? Should they be starting to busk on Eyre Square or Grafton Street to allow them to cover their rents? Let us not forget our apprentices who are not even covered by the national minimum wage legislation, discriminatory as it is.

I mo dháilcheantar féin, is é ceann de na ceantair is iargúlta ann ná ceantar Gaeltachta. Tugaim rud amháin faoi deara sa Seomra nuair a labhraím i nGaeilge go minic, is é sin, go mbím orm é a rá arís i mBéarla. Is ceantar iargúlta é seo i mo dháilcheantar agus áit a labhraíonn formhór na ndaoine Gaeilge agus a mbíonn daoine ag obair trí Ghaeilge agus ag caitheamh a saol trí Ghaeilge. Caithfimid breathnú air sin. Tá na cluaisíní ar fáil agus is féidir le daoine éisteacht leis an méid atá á rá i nGaeilge, i mBéarla, má theastaíonn sé sin uathu. Is rud tábhachtach é. Má táimid ag caint faoi thábhacht cheantair tuaithe, tá ceantair Ghaeltachta san áireamh ansin. Ar ndóigh, teastaíonn infheistíocht.Is é ceann de na rudaí is deacra do dhaoine ná an t-infreastruchtúr. Nuair atá an aimsir go hálainn, mar atá sé faoi láthair, tá chuile dhuine ag iarraidh a bheith ina gcónaí i gConamara mar gheall go bhfuil na tránna chomh hálainn agus teastaíonn an t-infreastruchtúr caoi do na daoine atá ag iarraidh a bheith ina gcónaí agus teaghlach a thógáil ann. Teastaíonn infheistíocht sna bóithre, droichid agus céanna. Tá sé seo luaite agam go rímhinic leis an Aire mar tá impleachtaí aige sin ar fhostaíocht, ar ghnólachtaí a lonnú ann agus ar an turas chuig an obair sa chathair más gá. Chomh maith leis sin, caithfimid breathnú ar chúrsaí séarachais. Tá a fhios agam go dtuigeann an tAire na deacrachtaí pleanála. Tá sé sin luaite sa tuairisc a d’fhoilsigh sí an tseachtain seo caite, ach caithfimid breathnú ar chúrsaí séarachais ionas go mbeidh daoine in ann cur isteach i gcomhair pleanála agus nach mbeidh sé ina bhac arís agus arís eile. We need to be realistic when we talk about rural Ireland. The Irish language is spoken in my constituency in one of the most iargúlta and rural areas of Connemara. If we want to be serious about representing all places, we should also be ensuring this is a bilingual Chamber. I am not saying that to give out and people obviously have different levels of Irish, but we need to ensure people have the ability to listen to what is being said in Irish there and then. That is important.	spk_228

It shows that for a lot of people who may have had access to third level education who previously had been locked out, are now being locked out as a result of the housing crisis. The survey showed that 71% of students had difficulties or extreme difficulties in meeting their monthly housing-related costs. The same percentage had difficulties in actually finding the accommodation. People were paying €750 to €900 per month. This is completely and utterly unsustainable.

The Minister stated that bringing on more instructors is not the key issue at this point, but it is also something we need to look at. We are trying to get people to move into this from quite well-paid jobs. It involves a significant pay cut so that is something that needs to be looked at.

Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-05-31	dail	33	Home Ownership: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	The Minister of State's party says it is the party of home ownership, but when we look at the census figures released yesterday, they tell us the opposite. What they show us is that the percentage of people who own their own home has fallen in the period since the party went into government in 2011. In that year, it promised us new politics. More than a decade later, that new politics has created a new generation, that is, a generation that rents. It may be young people or older people - pensioners - who are conscripted into a rent trap, where rents are increasingly taking more of their income. Pensioners cannot retire because they would not be able to continue renting. Like hamsters on a hamster wheel, they constantly try to run faster, but get nowhere. While we hear the Minister of State's party is the party of home ownership, what does that mean for people in Galway? Galway is an acute example of the housing crisis. I talk to young people and married couples my age who are living with their parents because they do not have a hope of getting a mortgage or being able to rent. They ask me when this affordable housing will come on stream in Galway. They have heard the Government talk about this housing since 2019. What we have heard most recently, however, is that those houses will not be delivered until 2025. What are those people supposed to do in that intervening period? They cannot wait another six years. I am tired of saying it in this Chamber. Many young married couples say to me that they simply cannot have children because they are not in the housing position to be able to do so. That is on the Government.  Tá rud eile le rá faoin tuath. Tá fadhb ollmhór inti, atá le feiceáil i gConamara ach go háirithe. Tá daoine ag iarraidh cur leis an soláthar tithíochta. Tá talamh acu agus tá siad ag iarraidh a dteach a thógáil don chlann atá acu. Tá siad ag iarraidh fanacht sa cheantar dúchais atá acu agus an Ghaeilge a labhairt agus cur leis an gcultúr sa Ghaeltacht. Ní féidir leo, áfach, mar nach bhfuil siad in ann pleanáil a fháil. Cé nach bhfuil áit ar bith le fáil ar cíos agus nach bhfuil siad in ann teach a cheannach sa cheantar, níl siad in ann cur leis an soláthar tithíochta ach an oiread.

Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-05-24	dail	33	Access to Autism and Disability Assessments and Supports: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_7	Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le Páirtí an Lucht Oibre as an rún seo a chur chun cinn inniu. I would like to raise a number of issues. First, Ability West which provides services for people with disabilities in Galway has had to temporarily close a respite centre due to staffing issues. We are now entering the third month that it has been unable to facilitate respite care for service users. This is, of course, a vital service for people with disabilities and their families. Currently, the HSE is advising that there is no timeline for the reopening of the service. The second issue is in relation to support staff such as speech therapists, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists who work with children with disabilities. We hear all the time about the recruitment and retention issues that are at play across the health sector. We have been hearing about it for years but we also need to think about what we are actually doing about it. I am friends with a number of qualified healthcare workers who would love to be able to build a life in Ireland but they are finding that they cannot get stable, well-paid work at home. They can get that abroad but they just cannot get that full-time work here. Once we have these workers, we need to make sure there is that joined-up thinking around delivering their expertise where it is needed. I met recently with a parent of an autistic child who is in an autistic spectrum disorder, ASD, class with four other children in Connemara. This child has had to reduce his hours in school because of the lack of available supports. The CDNT has vacancies for occupational therapists, speech therapists and a dietician. In terms of the situation on the ground with these services, a speech therapist travelled to work with one of the children in the class in the middle of Connemara in one day. They then returned a number of weeks later to work with a different child. A far more productive use of that therapist's time would be to accommodate multiple children in the one visit rather than spending that time in the car between Galway city and Connemara. Sometimes there is that lack of joined-up thinking. This class includes three non-verbal children so they really need that support. This would be a massive opportunity for the children to engage with the therapist and move forward in their speech development.	spk_21

Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-05-10	dail	33	European Year of Skills: Statements	dbsect_15	"Yesterday marked the start of the European Year of Skills, which will run until 8 May 2024. It is an important European initiative that ties together many of the different efforts being made in Europe, including, of course, a kind of European green new deal. It will attempt to raise awareness by matching people's aspirations with the available job opportunities. That is significant for everybody's way of life. It will try to promote investment in high-skilled staff. It aims at a collaborative effort which brings together everyone, including workers, social partners and employers, to improve their skill sets for the green and digital economy. It also has a focus on promoting lifelong learning. The European Commission stated, ""Having a workforce with the skills that are in demand contributes to sustainable growth, leads to more innovation and improves companies' competitiveness."" It also stated:The European Year of Skills 2023 will help companies, in particular small and medium enterprises, to address skills shortages in the EU. It will promote a mindset of reskilling and upskilling, helping people to get the right skills for quality jobs.Those are noble, aspirational and desirable sentiments and I do not think any sensible person in this House would find them disagreeable. As with other such EU initiatives, the drive to make them a reality will have to come from below. It will have to come from the member states themselves. It will be all about the buy-in from member states and how seriously they take it. I can see from the Department’s website that a significant number of events are set to take place over the next year. These events are certainly a good opportunity for us to identify the skills that are needed. However, we must do more than that. When discussing the jobs of the future, the Minister mentioned we do not even know what kinds of jobs we will need. That is important. We will also have to establish why skills that have already been identified as in demand have not been brought on board quickly enough. We need to identify the shortcomings in the manner in which the current offerings are made. The delivery methods by which we train people, the way our workforce upskills and how we encourage the process of lifelong learning must be under constant evaluation and re-evaluation. Not only do we know that different types of jobs will come on board and certain skills may not be as needed in the future, we also need to understand why there have previously been shortcomings. I will focus on the areas of apprenticeships, skills for the all-island economy and lifelong learning. With regard to apprenticeships, we must be frank that we have been failing. If the measure of success is reaching the target the Government has set for itself, it is difficult to reach any other conclusion. In 2016, the Government set a target of 9,000 annual apprenticeship registrations by 2020. In 2023, we still have not reached that target. A new target of 10,000 was set in 2020 but we have not even reached the old target. The Government had set a target of 750 apprentices working in the public sector and semi-State bodies by 2025. The Minister, Deputy Harris, stated in March that there were approximately 320, which was well behind the target. Very slow progress has been made on the establishment of new types of apprenticeships, particularly those aligned with modern methods of construction, MMC, and green construction-related work. More work needs to be done in this area, specifically when we look at the total inadequacy of our housing supply. We need to be looking at that from a green perspective but also from a delivery perspective. In 2018, the Government established the construction sector group to promote MMC and the skills it requires. The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has put out skills reports which identify many of these new apprenticeship types but they are very slow in coming on stream. Part of the work of the Minister and his Department must not simply identify those skills we already know we need but must identify the underlying reasons we are not making progress. We know there are far too few choosing apprenticeships relative to the time before the financial crisis. It is not hard to understand why. One report I came across by the Department spoke to that point and mentioned the precarity of work in the Irish construction sector. We have a history of a cycle of boom and bust and bogus self-employment, as has been discussed at length in this Chamber. Earnings for craft and trade workers in Ireland are the most unequally distributed of any high-income EU country. This is driven by an intergenerational earnings gap that has widened more than in any other high-income EU country except Belgium over the past 15 years. The gap between the earnings of craft and trade workers under the age of 30 and the older workers in Ireland is now the widest of this group, and the median hourly rate for young workers is second lowest behind Italy when adjusted for living costs. Significant numbers of our apprentices qualify and head off to places such as Australia and New Zealand. We see this pattern repeated in the likes of the healthcare system. That is easily identifiable and needs to be addressed. I will move to the all-island economy and will focus on a particular example that was raised with me this week. There are students in Donegal who want to do apprenticeships in North West Regional College in Derry city, which is recognised for having excellent facilities. It is close by if you live in Donegal. However, there is a major barrier, which is the requirement for the employer to be registered and based in the North. Students with a local employer in Donegal who want to live in Bundoran, Buncrana or wherever else cannot use that employer if they are attending the college in Derry. It means they have to look to places like Galway and Cork for the educational part of their apprenticeship, which makes things more difficult for people with the cost of travel, difficulties finding affordable accommodation and not being able to commute as easily. I hope that, as part of the year of skills, we can examine ways to support the throughput of apprentices through the system with a greater all-island approach. In respect of workforce upskilling and lifelong learning, there are a few things I would like to note. The Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has been hearing about the work that is being done to promote the teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM. We heard there has been difficulty in getting teachers and lecturers in that area. We also heard that one of the courses designed to try to help people upskill in these areas was run by Coláiste Dhúlaigh in conjunction with Trinity College but that course has not run since 2019. If we want to encourage people to upskill, we need to ensure an availability of courses that are sufficiently promoted to let interested applicants know of their existence. Many industries remain paper-based and are badly in need of digitalisation. In recent years, new part-time courses have been brought online and are designed to meet critical skills requirements in the digital area. These are courses which tend to teach a range of skills, such as computer programming through the package Python, database management systems like SQL, and statistical methods. The introduction of these courses was certainly welcome. It followed on from earlier efforts at identifying the skills that would be needed for the economy of the future. However, we should recognise there are significant dropout rates in those courses. There is a consensus among some that the difficulty and intensity of the courses for the people coming from unrelated backgrounds contributes to the high dropout rate. When these courses were first introduced, it was felt that it needed to be a case of sink or swim.But, as noted in the  I am running out of time and my colleague, Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú, wants to contribute. I just want to mention one proposal that has been attracting a lot of attention. That is the idea of a job guarantee scheme, where the State acts as a kind of employer of last resort. The European youth guarantee scheme in some ways offers a model for this. This was a commitment by member states to ensure that all young people under the age of 30 receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of them becoming unemployed or leaving education. That is a very interesting and exciting concept but it is not something we have always lived up to. This is something we should look at, given the budget surpluses of €65 billion by 2025, and this being the European Year of Skills. We see the difficulties a lot of young people have. They want to stay in the country and they cannot for a variety of reasons such as the cost of housing and other costs. This is an extremely good model and it is something on which we should focus."	spk_212
Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-05-03	dail	33	Construction Safety Licensing Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_14	Go raibh maith agat. That sounds like a good group so I might see if I can join them afterwards with Deputy O’Connor. Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Collins. This marks my first time engaging with the Minister of State in my new role as spokesperson on higher education. As it is also the first legislation that I get to deal with in my new role, I feel that, today, I have reached two milestones in this role in one go. It is my hope that we will have a very positive working relationship. No doubt, there will be differences of opinion, probably strong differences of opinion, but I will strive to engage constructively with the Minister of State. I have no doubt we will share different political views, political values and visions for higher education in the State, yet I believe we can work through arguments and that the Minister of State will see that when I bring forward my arguments, policy documents and legislation, I will always do so in good faith. I hope these efforts reflect my own belief in the important role that higher education will play when it comes to things like industrial policy, apprenticeships and planning for the economy of the future. I hope they will reflect my strongly held view that education is a public good, one which unquestionably serves the public interest, and reflect my firm conviction that research, both quantitative and qualitative, is the driving force in the creation of knowledge, not just in the economy but in the wider society in which it is embedded. In my previous role as spokesperson on public expenditure, when it came to dealing with legislation, I believe the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, and I engaged very constructively, particularly around significant legislation like the new protected disclosures regime and the update to the lobbying regime. We certainly did not always agree. There were times when I felt he did not go far enough and I am sure there were times when he thought I was going too far. However, where we could reach consensus, he was amenable to accepting my amendments and I made sure to acknowledge him in those instances. I feel this is the right way to deal with significant legislation and not to reflexively shoot down amendments by virtue of the fact that they originated on this side of the House. I hope this approach can be applied when this Bill and the others the Minister of State will bring forward reach Committee Stage. With that said, I turn to the Bill before us today. I understand this Bill has a focus on the work the Department is undertaking with regard to Housing for All and the national development plan. I am also aware, and I heard again today, that there are health and safety concerns underlying the Bill. I have seen the Construction Industry Federation's report from last year which showed that workplace accidents in 2021 had increased by 4.3%, which equated to 794 reported injuries. I imagine that any sensible person would be in favour of efforts to improve workplace safety, particularly in a profession such as this, where there are reports of some of the highest levels of workplace accidents. Of course, this has a real-life impact on the people who are impacted by it, those who are working in the sector and, indeed, those who are delivering to construction sites as well.We also need to remember that a lot of the risks involved relate to working at heights and in adverse weather conditions. One of the many benefits of the use of modern methods of construction, which I have long been urging the Minister of State's colleagues, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, to consider, is the fact that it addresses these risks specifically. The modern approach moves a significant amount of work from the construction site to the factory floor, to indoor working conditions. The need to work at heights is also greatly reduced. The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has already undertaken some work in this regard and has been examining the kinds of apprenticeships that will be needed to support greater uses of modern methods of construction here. This is an area in which I am particularly interested and I am sure we will get a chance to discuss it in greater detail. Hopefully it is something that we can move along on and I would very much welcome that. On SOLAS becoming the recognised licensing authority, it is no harm to have a clear line of responsibility. It should also help to standardise and professionalise the sector. I am aware that on building sites and for construction work in general, some types of tradespeople like electricians or plumbers might have needed to demonstrate their qualifications or have a requirement for a certain sign-off from their respective associations, but this Bill brings greater standardisation and professionalisation of work, which is very welcome. If it brings greater accountability for work that is later found to be substandard, that is welcome too. I would like to hear more detail on this and perhaps it can be teased out on Committee Stage. If SOLAS is gaining new powers then it would appear that it is taking on a new role  Another thing I have noticed in the Bill, which I appreciate, is an attempt to encourage greater female participation in what is obviously a very heavily male-dominated sector. Sometimes people might say that I also work in a fairly male-dominated sector, although we are getting better. I was looking at figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, earlier which show that female participation in the construction sector is at 9% but, to be fair, Ireland is not an outlier in that regard. It is a male-dominated sector throughout the world. Countries like Australia have actively tried to encourage greater diversity but even there, female participation in the construction sector is only around 12%, which is only slightly higher than our own rate despite that particular focus. Some Australian states have begun taking steps towards non-binding quotas and so on. For instance, in the state of Victoria, there is now a mandate that at least 4% of labour hours for apprentices and trainees will be required to be performed by women. Having read the Bill itself and the related documentation, a lot of the attention and focus is on being able to deliver on housing and the national development plan, NDP. I believe the housing and the wider infrastructural deficit is one of the greatest failures of the last decade. We are in a much different position than we were a decade ago. At that time, we were told that we did not have the money to tackle the crisis but that is certainly not the case today. This year we are forecast to run a budget surplus of €10 billion and next year, we are forecast to run a surplus of over €16 billion. In fact, some estimate that we will run surpluses for the rest of the decade. The funds are there but the question is how best to use them. It should be clear that something drastic is needed because right now, we are caught in a vicious cycle. The housing crisis is forcing many young people to emigrate. Many apprentices are looking towards life in Australia. We are in a position where we need more apprentices to build more houses but because of the lack of affordable housing, many of the apprentices we are getting through the system are leaving. Furthermore, those qualified tradespeople who emigrated during the last crisis, some of whom would like to come home, cannot do so because of the lack of affordable housing. Tá go leor rudaí maithe sa Bhille seo, ach go háirithe i dtéarmaí go mbeadh níos mó ban bainteach leis an earnáil seo. Beidh sé suimiúil a fheiceáil cén bealach gur féidir é sin a dhéanamh.

I have a couple of points I wish to raise in my limited time. At the start of this week, a survey conducted by Galway Chamber showed the real-life impact we all knew was happening, but it was good to get a detailed survey that showed the impact the housing crisis in Galway city is having across the board, including on employment. People should be able to access good employment, but the fact they are unable to access good-quality or, indeed, any kind of housing is also impacting on their ability to access employment. Four of five businesses indicated housing was hindering their ability to hire. The equivalent figure in the tech sector was nine of ten, while 70% of businesses said the crisis was impacting on their staffing retention. We can see this, given that if people end up being evicted thanks to the Government's decision to end the eviction ban, they will have nowhere to go and will have to leave their jobs because they cannot commute, not least because of the lack of public transport. This is my third time raising the next issue, including twice with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. It needs to be addressed as well as soon as possible, so I ask the Minister of State to reiterate it to the Minister. The latter needs to issue a circular to the councils to say that if a tenant receiving HAP from one council lives in another council area, that council can nonetheless use the tenant  My colleague Louis O'Hara has been actively campaigning in recent months in regard to an issue related to Cashla, Athenry. Twelve households who received notices to quit in late 2021 are being evicted between February and May of this year. Those tenants feel a great sense of frustration and injustice about what has happened to them. Again, because of the cruel decision by the Government to lift the eviction ban, they are going to be thrown out and God knows where they are going to go. They do not know where they are going to go, so unless the Minister of State can tell us, who knows?	spk_31

Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-04-25	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	There has been a lot of commentary over the past week about the sale of land in Patrickswell, County Limerick. It has been reported that in December 2006 a solicitor acting on behalf of the wife of the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, wrote to the council seeking to purchase the land and that then, the following month, councillors, including Deputy Collins, voted to allow the council to dispose of the land. At that meeting he did not declare his wife's correspondence to the council, and the land was subsequently sold to his wife in 2008. Will the Taoiseach advise if he has spoken to the Minister of State about this? I know the Taoiseach has made clear in media reports that the Minister of State should have recused himself from that meeting, but has the Minister of State given the Taoiseach assurances that he is not in breach of the Local Government Act by not declaring an interest or recusing himself in that vote? Will the Taoiseach confirm to the House that he is satisfied that the Minister of State is not in breach of section 177 of the Local Government Act?	spk_120

Earlier today, I heard the Taoiseach say that we in Sinn Féin are gaslighting young people. That is from a Government that tells us it is there for the people who get up early in the morning, whatever that means, and is there for the people who want to own their own homes. Since 2012, the percentage of 25- to 34-year-olds who are living with their parents has increased from 21% to 41%. Is the Minister trying to tell us that those young people want to be living with their parents? I can tell him they do not. The Minister said that his focus is on building capacity. The only thing that I can see the Government building on is homelessness. The Minister tells us that we are gaslighting people but I can tell him it is the Government that is doing the gaslighting. On affordable housing, since 2019 there has been talk about an affordable housing scheme in Galway.It keeps getting delayed. They are now saying it will be delivered in Galway in 2025. Does the Minister know how many houses will be delivered in that affordable housing scheme? It is 85. It is not just me saying that is not good enough, but the Minister's own colleagues who are saying it is not good enough. Does the Minister know what his colleagues are also saying? They are saying it was wrong to lift the eviction ban, but if his mantra is to build and build and build on homelessness, then it was the correct decision. I heard the Minister say on television that he knew it would increase homelessness and yet he made the decision anyway. I ask him to provide the circular for councillors so that they know what to do in terms of buying houses for people who are on HAP in a different county. As they have not got it, the Minister may as well get his act together on it.	spk_345

The Minister even admits that we will see an increase in homelessness yet at the exact same time he also admits that there is very little emergency accommodation across this State. I can see it in Galway City Council and Galway County Council. I see it with the people coming in through my door every day. They do not know where they are going. They have no confidence that the Government has any idea where they will go. The Minister cannot make any mistake about this. The Minister knows that people's lives will be thrown into absolute and utter turmoil because of this decision that he and his colleagues in government have created. That means the care-free innocence of childhood is totally shattered because families are worried. Parents are worried and that, obviously, goes onto the children as well. The Minister tells us time and time again that he is expanding the tenant  The Minister is not listening to us in opposition. The Minister is not listening to housing campaigners.

Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-03-22	dail	33	Pre-European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_18	We have had sight of the proposed reform of the EU fiscal rules and governance framework. The Government had not prioritised this but the Joint Committee on Finance attempted to engage with the process of reform. The new proposals will take time to work their way through different stages at EU level before they become law but, having now seen them, it seems to be a case of the new rules being just like the old rules. I am flabbergasted that there is no change to the 3% rule, which provides that member states must keep their deficit within 3% of GDP. This rule is completely arbitrary and is not grounded on any kind of empirical evidence. It is not some kind of equilibrium rule that states that a 4% deficit is unsustainable whereas one of 3% is. The finance committee got to the origin of the rule. A low-ranking French bureaucrat working at the French treasury came up with it more than three decades ago. His rationale was that, at the time, France was running a deficit of approximately 1.8% or 2%, which was a little too close for comfort and 3% gave a bit more breathing room. That was simply it. When we cast our minds back to the austerity period when Fianna Fáil- and Fine Gael-led governments fell over themselves to make cuts in order to get the deficit below 3%, this was all because of a completely arbitrary rule.This is known as the debt rule where a member state should not have debts exceeding 60%. It was widely expected that this should be increased to 100% at the very least because of all the pandemic spending but that did not happen. The vast majority of member states have debts above 60% of GDP. Besides that, the quantum of debt is a poorer measure of sustainability than borrowing costs. There is no change to the investment clause, which could have exempted green investment from deficit and debt considerations, and this was a very poorly missed opportunity, especially, as was mentioned earlier, in light of the US introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act, which allows for major subsidies to both US companies and even European ones. That is why so many sensible experts have been concerned about the risk of de-industrialisation to the EU economy, as companies will flock to the US.  There has been the removal of the structural deficit calculation, which is welcome given the fact that it had become so complicated as to have become unworkable but, for the most part, the EU Commission has decided to keep to its usual 	spk_207
Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-03-21	dail	33	Finance Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_12	"The Bill will, of course, make the required changes that were identified as a response to the cost-of-living crisis. My colleague, Deputy Doherty, has mentioned this. We had heard time and time again that things could not be done but we kept raising them. I welcome that we are having this discussion. The Bill also includes provisions to amend the TBESS. I will speak to these issues as well as to others that are timely and necessary. The first issue I will address is excise duty and VAT. Households are continuing to struggle with sky-high energy bills. I constantly have people in my clinic, as does every other Member in this Chamber, who are struggling with energy bills. I have had renters in to me who live in a house that has been separated into flats, which means the energy credit had to be split several ways between the various renters occupying the property. Suffice it to say it did not go very far. Section 2 deals with the mineral oil tax and section 3 deals with VAT. Section 2 extends the reduced rates of excise duty applying to petrol and diesel but with staggered increases. I will not run through the timeline of different rate increases but I will flag that the increases will be in excess of the reduction the Minister previously brought in. This is due to the coming increase in the carbon tax. We had urged him to extend this reduction but that has clearly fallen on deaf ears. Under section 3, he has extended the reduced rate of VAT for electricity, gas and for the hospitality and tourism sectors. That would keep the lower VAT rate of 9%, reduced from 13.5%, in place until 31 October. While the lower rate is preferable to the higher rate, in the grand scheme of things it needs to be recognised that over the past two years, the cost of electricity and gas has more than doubled. Coupled with rising rents, rising food costs and other service cost inflation, it is hardly surprising that many people feel their general quality of life is deteriorating. According to Department of Finance figures, the VAT reduction will reduce gas prices for households only by approximately €26 from March to October. This works out at only €3.25 per month. In this day and age, €3.25 in Dublin would not even cover the cost of a cup of coffee in most places. The coming carbon tax increase will also increase the price of gas by €17. The increase in carbon tax due on home heating oil and gas in May will also offset the minor reduction this measure was designed to achieve. We had urged the Minister to extend the reduction of the rates of excise on petrol and diesel beyond February. It is a missed opportunity as it could have counteracted the carbon tax increases Section 5 deals with the TBESS and the various modifications being made to it. First, there is the extension of the scheme itself, which will be extended beyond the 30 April deadline to 31 May, with the potential to extend it again. It will reduce the energy costs threshold for the scheme and will increase the level of relief from 40% to 50% of the eligible costs, subject to the monthly limits provided for under the scheme. People welcome these changes but I am really disappointed that a scheme has yet to be established for those businesses that rely on oil and LPG. This issue comes up continually with me in County Galway because many people rely on them. I have been raising this for quite some time with the Minister and with other relevant Ministers. In his opening statement, the Minister said that something is going to come and something is going to happen, but the reality is that businesses have closed as a result. I am dealing with businesses that have to remain closed for part of the week or several days of the week. This impacts not only the services they provide but also the entire rural community because it impacts employment and the general services in the area. The Minister said that he is looking at it and that it has been flagged to be looked at for some time now, but we need action on it now or it will just continue to impact on these businesses that will be forced into closure as a result. We can see the number of businesses that have been closed as a result. We are discussing this because we know that people are struggling as a result of the cost-of-living crisis. We have been clear in our critique of the Government's response to this. Earlier I referred to the deterioration in people's quality of life as a result of the impact of increases in costs. One of those costs is something that is going to be debated again later this evening, which is the impact of the cost of housing and the precarious nature of the cost of housing. This is really impacting people's lives. We hear about accidental landlords but we do not hear enough about accidental tenants. This is very strange. Let us consider the number of accidental tenants, those people in my age group, who want to buy a home and who are simply not able to do that. A large number of people do not want to rent but they have no other choice. As a result, they are stuck on the rental hamster wheel and are constantly required to run faster and faster. They are constantly living in fear that they might receive a notice to quit and they will be unable to find somewhere else that is affordable, or even find anything at all. Now the Minister will get rid of the eviction ban before he has even put in place measures that he feels will help. Given the failure of all the schemes I have seen up to this point, I am not hopeful in any way, shape or form. We know, and the Minister has said that he sees it, that the number of homeless people will increase as a result. I raise this because all of this is linked. Even before we had the invasion of Ukraine and even before we experienced the huge increase in the rate of inflation, the cost-of-living crisis in the State was horrendous because we had some of the highest rents in Europe and because people did not have security of tenure in their homes It is only getting worse. The Minister is about to create what Fr. Peter McVerry has described as a social ""catastrophe"". That is on this Government's head with the decision it will make later tonight and tomorrow. I am really thrown by that and by this Government.The Government is ready and willing to see people thrown out on the streets, which we know is going to happen. In Galway city and county, for example, there is not enough emergency accommodation to actually deal with people who will be in that position. There is simply no room for people at this point. We know how much people are struggling. A recent report from Barnardos confirmed that people are struggling to put food on the table for their children. People do not have any buffer but even if they did have a financial buffer, at this point there is literally nowhere to go. What do they do? We have not had a response from the Government on that at all. I really am shocked by this. The reality is that this is the result of policy over a number of years. We saw it when Fine Gael welcomed the vulture funds to Ireland. We saw it when huge numbers of local authority staff were laid off, which had a serious knock-on impact that we are still seeing in the context of housing maintenance across our housing stock. We saw tax break after tax break being introduced for a whole variety of investment fund-type vehicles. The Government has presided over property prices going back above Celtic tiger levels and rents reaching the highest point ever. Now we are hearing about difficulties in the banking sector and I have to say I have an awful sense that we have come full circle here. I am glad the Minister listened to us in the sense that he felt that something needed to be done. I did fear that nothing would be done. That said, there are serious issues here and the Minister has both the power and the opportunity to help people. He knows, having worked with me previously, that there are times when I agree with him and times when I do not agree with him but see his point of view. On this issue, however, I just do not get it. I really hope the Minister changes his mind."	spk_156

Tá sé fíorthábhachtach go bhfuil Seachtain na Gaeilge againn. Is dócha gurb é seo an céad uair don Aire Stáit, an Teachta O'Donovan, bheith mar Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta le linn Seachtain na Gaeilge. Cuirim fáilte roimhe sin. Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar chuid lárnach d'ár gcultúr náisiúnta. Feicimid inár gceantair féin an stair a bhaineann lenár dteanga féin, mar aon le teanga ar bith. Is rud fíorthábhachtach é. Léirítear an stair atá sa cheantar agus stair ár bpobal freisin nuair a bhreathnaímid ar logainmneacha, focail difriúla agus mar sin de. Bhí píosa an-suimiúil ar ""Iris Aniar"" ar maidin le fear ó Inis Oírr. Bhí sé ag míniú na bhfocal difriúil atá acu ar Inis Oírr agus atá ar Inis Meáin, ar Inis Mór agus i gConamara. Léiríonn sé an tábhacht agus an stair atá ag ár dteanga. Ar ndóigh, caithfimid a chinntiú go bhfuil an Stát ag tacú leis an nGaeilge agus ag tacú le muintir na Gaeilge. Mura ndéantar é sin, tá bagairt ann go gcaillfimid an teanga. Tá an Ghaeltacht mar chroílár na Gaeilge agus caithimid gach uile shórt a dhéanamh le cinntiú go gcoinnítear an Ghaeltacht ina pobal láidir bríomhar. Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil líon na gcainteoirí laethúla sa Ghaeltacht ag laghdú agus nach bhfuil ach 23% de theaghlaigh Ghaeltachta ag tógáil a gcuid teaghlach trí Ghaeilge. Caithfimid déileáil leis sin. Fáiltím leis an méid a d'fhógair an tAire Stáit inné, is é sin, maoiniú d'Ionad Cuimhneacháin na nImirceach. Bhí píosa air sin ar Raidió na Gaeltachta ar maidin. Bhí daoine á fháiltiú. Luaigh daoine ar an gclár sin ar maidin an deacracht atá ann maidir le pleanáil agus tithíocht sa Ghaeltacht dóibh siúd atá ag iarraidh teacht ar ais go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus doibh siúd atá ina gcónaí inti cheana féin. Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil neart cúiseanna ann go bhfuil laghdú ag teacht ar líon na gcainteoirí, ach cuireann sé isteach go mór orm nach féidir le teaghlaigh Ghaeltachta tithe a cheannach ná a thógáil ina gceantair féin agus go bhfuil siad á mbrú ón gceantar sin. Ní féidir leo a gcuid páistí a thógáil ina gceantar dúchais agus trí Ghaeilge go háitiúil. Caithfimid mar shochaí, agus caithfidh an Rialtas, breathnú ar chúrsaí teanga in aice le cúrsaí tithíochta agus pleanála. Tá na dúshláin teanga agus tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht fite fuaite ina chéile. Fiú nuair atá muintir na Gaeltachta in ann fanacht inti, is fadhb ollmhór í go bhfuil eagrais Stáit fós ag cur bunsheirbhísí ar fáil go minic trí Bhéarla amháin. Tá a fhios agam go maith i mo Dháilcheantar agus i gConamara ach go háirithe go mbíonn iallach ar dhaoine Béarla a úsáid go sáchmhinic chun déileáil leis an Stát. Bheadh a fhios ag an Leas-Cheann Comhairle faoi sin freisin. Bíonn fadhbanna uisce go rímhinic i gConamara. Bhí an-deacracht ag daoine labhairt leis na hionadaithe ó Uisce Éireann. Nuair nach raibh duine le Gaeilge ar fáil, bhí rogha acu iompú ar an mBéarla nó fanacht go mbeidh duine le Gaeilge ar fáil chun eolas agus tacaíocht a fháil. I gcás práinneach mar sin, níl sé sin sáchmhaith. I gcásanna go bhfuil an-strus ar dhaoine, tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go bhféadfaidís déileáil leis an Stát sa teanga ina bhfuil siad is compordaí. Nuair atá tinneas ar dhuine éigin agus teastaíonn cabhair leighis éigeandála uathu, nó nuair atá gá ag daoine déileáil leis na gardaí nó an córas dlí agus cirt, tá sé fíorthábhachtach go mbeidís in ann labhairt sa teanga atá is nádúrtha dóibh. Tá daoine an-leochaileach i gcásanna mar sin. Níor cheart don Stát é a dhéanamh níos deacra dóibh. Impím ar an Aire Stáit éisteacht leis na moltaí atá déanta ag mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Ó Snodaigh, agus iad a chur i bhfeidhm. Ba cheart don Rialtas measúnú tionchair teanga a chinntiú ar thograí molta sa Ghaeltacht. Ba cheart freisin go gcuirfí coinníollacha teanga ar fhorbairtí chun ról na Gaeilge mar theanga an phobail a chosaint, agus ba cheart go dtógfaí scéim labhairt na Gaeilge ar ais chun spreagadh a thabhairt do thuismitheoirí má thógann siad a gcuid páistí trí Ghaeilge. Tá sé iontach go bhfuil na ráitis seo ar siúl an tseachtain seo ach ba chóir dúinn i bhfad níos mó Gaeilge a úsáid sa Seomra seo. Ba chóir do dhaoine a bheith sásta na cluaisíní a úsáid ionas go mbeadh gach uile dhuine in ann a ghnó dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge."	spk_442
Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-03-08	dail	33	Protection of Cash as Legal Tender: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I commend the Rural Independent Group for bringing this forward. Often when we talk about cash and those people who access cash, we talk about older people. Personally, I far prefer to use cash because it is a far easier way to know how much you are spending, where your money is going etc. A lot of speakers before me have already detailed the impact that not having access to or being able to pay for goods in cash can and would have on a vast array of different people, especially older people who find online banking etc. a lot more difficult. I want to make some wider points as well, I suppose to put this debate in a different context. Obviously we need to recognise that cash represents at present only 3% of the money supply in most developed countries and the overwhelming majority of it is digital. In recent times, certain types of notes have been phased out. Most ordinary people have never seen a €500 note. Such notes were mostly used in money-laundering and by those engaged in financial crime and hence high denomination notes were phased out. It is also important to address the proposals for central bank digital currencies which often exercise people. There are various motivations for central bank digital currencies. There is the rise of crypto-currencies, the Chinese Central Bank's efforts to create its own digital yuan, the US Federal Reserve and ECB's fear of being left behind etc. Of course, then there are the impacts of quantitative easing. During the last financial crisis, significant amounts of new digital currency were created. This was, in effect, given over to the commercial banking sector in the hope that it would lend to the real economy but that did not work out as planned. Banks largely sat on this new credit or used it to buy and sell existing assets, and hence the major price inflation in property assets and other financial assets over the past decade. It was stimulus for the banks but not for ordinary people. It contributed to growing wealth inequality but, unfortunately, we have not seen much focus on that. There are a number of reasons I think cash is important. For most people, and me personally, it is good to have access to cash.	spk_32
Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-03-07	dail	33	High Energy Costs: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_14	My colleagues have already pointed out that this week we heard the news that Electric Ireland would reduce its prices for some of its business customers but not for households. I have to admit I could not believe this when I heard it. We have energy companies making bizarre sums of money and record profits off the backs of households that are struggling to get by. In recent months my office has been inundated with people who simply cannot afford to pay their energy costs. They simply cannot afford to pay for their food. It is not something that is just happening in my office. It is happening in offices throughout the State. I cannot believe the Minister said he is telling people not to go without. Believe you me, people are going without. If he cannot understand at this point that people are going without, he should not listen to me but to Barnardos, which issued a report last week that showed how many parents and families are going without food because they cannot pay the cost of living. If the Government believes a certain reality exists at this time, its members had better start listening to people because it is not the reality for people on the ground. I have constituents in homes that are so badly insulated they have to pay crazy amounts of money to try to keep them heated. Even then they do not stay heated. There are people who could not get the full energy credit to help cover the rising costs. People may be legally renting a house that has been split up into flats and they all have the same MPRN. This means the house receives only one energy credit. This single credit is then split multiple ways. This is often in substandard accommodation with a low BER and the credit does not go very far. There will not be much respite for people in the coming months. My colleague Deputy Donnelly has just spoken about the freezing temperatures we are expecting in the coming days and weeks. There is research that states households consume as much, if not more, energy in the months of April, May and June as they do in October, November and December. While this spells trouble for many households, it is great news for energy providers. They can certainly extend their thanks to the Government because there is still no sign of a windfall tax. We heard that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, said previously that it was the wrong direction to go. The Government made the decision not to cap or reduce electricity prices despite governments throughout Europe doing just this. The time to cut energy costs is now.	spk_220

Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-03-02	dail	33	Public Procurement Contracts	dbsect_16	The reason I ask is because of a current industrial dispute regarding adult education tutors. As the Minister will be aware, this is a long-running campaign and some of the issues date back to the Haddington Road agreement. There have been multiple meetings at the WRC. In March 2020, three years ago this month, the Labour Court made a recommendation that the Government, of which Deputy Donohoe was then Minister for Finance, would make them an offer. In July 2022, the Government made a promise to them that an offer would be on the table by the end of September but, in spite of all of this, they are still waiting. Only a fortnight ago, the TUI and SIPTU had a meeting here and they informed us that the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research Innovation and Science wants to make them an offer. The real question is what is the hold-up at this point. I know they say a week is a long time in politics. If that is the case, these workers have really been waiting a lifetime.	spk_88
Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-03-02	dail	33	Public Procurement Contracts	dbsect_16	The reason I asked initially about the processes and procedures by which a line Department seeks permission for the release of funding is because there could sometimes be seen to be a pattern in this regard. The unions representing workers in a sector go to the line Department, and I understand that the Minister is saying this is where they need to go. However, the line Department might say that it supports them and that it can pay for this through existing funds, but that it cannot get the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform to sign off on it. It is something I have heard a number of times and it seems to be the situation here again. The unions engage with the relevant Department and that line Department gives the green light, but it then says it needs the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform to give it the green light and, as a result, the process reaches an impasse. I understand that one of the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform’s primary functions is to manage expenditure in a prudent fashion but when we have the Labour Court recommendation, the support of the relevant line Department and a Government commitment to make an offer, the question is whose decision it is and who is in charge.

As the Minister will be aware, this is a long-running campaign and some of the issues date back to the Haddington Road agreement. There have been multiple meetings at the WRC. In March 2020, three years ago this month, the Labour Court made a recommendation that the Government, of which Deputy Donohoe was then Minister for Finance, would make them an offer. In July 2022, the Government made a promise to them that an offer would be on the table by the end of September but, in spite of all of this, they are still waiting. Only a fortnight ago, the TUI and SIPTU had a meeting here and they informed us that the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research Innovation and Science wants to make them an offer.

Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-03-02	dail	33	Public Sector Pay	dbsect_17	The reason I asked initially about the processes and procedures by which a line Department seeks permission for the release of funding is because there could sometimes be seen to be a pattern in this regard. The unions representing workers in a sector go to the line Department, and I understand that the Minister is saying this is where they need to go. However, the line Department might say that it supports them and that it can pay for this through existing funds, but that it cannot get the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform to sign off on it. It is something I have heard a number of times and it seems to be the situation here again. The unions engage with the relevant Department and that line Department gives the green light, but it then says it needs the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform to give it the green light and, as a result, the process reaches an impasse. I understand that one of the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform’s primary functions is to manage expenditure in a prudent fashion but when we have the Labour Court recommendation, the support of the relevant line Department and a Government commitment to make an offer, the question is whose decision it is and who is in charge. It is clear that someone needs to take ownership of this issue. I ask the Minister to give a commitment that this will be done because the line Department is saying it is up to his Department.	spk_90

That is a valid point. If she pursues it, I will follow that with interest. The amendment, which will require the gathering of more information with regard to details of payments received or fees charged, could be very helpful and it would be interesting to be able to look at it from a departmental point of view and see whether, within certain Departments or in regard to particular legislation, there was a specific interest in the fees charged. That can only assist with democracy and with looking at the types of lobbying that are conducted. Of course, that is something which we are looking to keep a closer eye through the passage of the Bill. It is welcome that we are again dealing with this issue, given we looked at it in great detail on Committee Stage with the Minister. It is also a topic to which a Bill I brought forward relates. Deputy Shortall’s other point on the lobbying that can be done by former Members is valid. It is a matter we discussed in committee. It was covered in my Bill, and the pre-legislative scrutiny report produced by our committee indicated it should be considered. It was agreed that where former Members are engaging in lobbying activity, we should look at that access issue. We have been debating it since the beginning of our discussions with a view to strengthening the Bill, and it is very important. I have written to the Ceann Comhairle about the matter and will follow up on it with him. It is unfortunate that amendment No. 1 could not be moved, but when it comes to lobbying and access, we need to examine carefully the fact that former Members have a different type of access from that of other people and whether that constitutes a fair situation. I would argue that is not the case and that, in the context of lobbying, we need to be as transparent and clear as possible and ensure it will be in line with the provisions of the Bill. There is a great deal of merit to the amendment. Having more information on the details of payments and fees charged can only be of benefit for lobbying and democracy itself. I will support the amendment.	spk_261

The Minister and Deputy Shortall will be aware of my own Bill and the amendments I submitted on Committee Stage, which were not accepted, which proposed to introduce criminal sanctions for criminal infringements. As I argued then, I do not believe administrative sanctions would be a strong enough deterrent. I also proposed shortening the review period of the legislation because as I pointed out then, lobbying is a fast-paced industry and technology develops quickly. Communication can be fast and often anonymous. We thrashed all that out on Committee Stage. I feel it is important to mention it here again. A report produced after three years on the impact of the sanctions and the commission's capacity to implement these should reveal whether they are working, so I support the amendment.	spk_267
Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-02-28	dail	33	Credit Union (Amendment) Bill 2022 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_14	I welcome the fact that we are having this discussion on the Credit Union (Amendment) Bill 2022 and, indeed, the work credit unions are doing at the moment and continue to do. It is very important, of course, that we listen to what the credit union sector has been saying regarding the powers and ability it has.I have a particularly keen interest in the issue and I have been quite vocal about the reforms this sector needs to help it not just survive but thrive. I am a proud member of my local credit union and I have had a long-term interest in this sector. I chose this subject for my master's thesis and I have long had an interest in it. I recognise the even greater importance that credit unions can take on, especially in light of a commercial banking sector that is highly concentrated at this moment in time and is struggling to introduce changes. Credit unions function a bit like the community banking model and the not-for-profit banking sector, albeit with certain differences. Credit unions are highly valued by their members and by the communities in which they are located. They have continually enjoyed the significant trust of their members. When we consider the banking crisis, the credit union sector did not cause the latest banking crisis, yet many of the regulations that were brought in following the crash treated the credit unions as if they did. The sector has long called for changes that would allow it to fulfil its greater potential to access different credit markets here. I am glad to see the first major legislative change for the credit union sector since the 2012 Act. There are some good provisions in this Bill. A number of the recommendations that came out of the strategic banking review, which the credit union movement fed into, are positive. I will not go through all of them but I will address a few, particularly those that relate to interest rate regulations, new governance proposals and lending and other business creation provisions. With regard to interest rate regulation, the new maximum rates that can be charged on loans is welcome. They will provide added security for their members. Credit unions are moneylenders. In fact, the original motivation for establishing the credit union movement was to stop moneylenders and, therefore, credit unions have not been known to charge overly usurious rates to their members, but there is no harm in having additional protections here. On the proposal around new governance structures, I believe the options are constructive. There are provisions to provide a new governance structure for appointing the chief executive officer, CEO, as a board member, and to reduce the number of annual meetings to six. Each credit union is its own organisation. Some may choose to opt into this and others may choose to opt out. In my experience, many credit union board members are volunteers who care passionately about their organisations. They may feel that six meetings annually is not sufficient, but what they do in that regard is a matter for them and I believe the correct thing to do. On the new provisions around inter-credit union lending and business creation, I am aware that has been long sought by the movement. It would allow one credit union to provide a loan to another or have one refer business to another. This would help to drive commercial activity and credit to members. The ability to establish these corporate credit unions, following the US model, will help the movement get more involved in the largest consumer market, namely mortgages. A corporate credit union would, in effect, serve as a kind of credit unions' credit union. It would be a group of credit unions that would come together for what would become a vehicle, perhaps for mortgage lending. This is something they have long called for and it is an issue I raised regularly in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach. I struggle to understand why we have waited for so long to do this. It is no secret that there is a lack of competition at the moment within the banking sector. Allowing credit unions to become more involved in mortgages would help to provide more competition. I want to point out, however, one missed opportunity, which I have raised several times previously at the finance committee. I am referring to credit unions' capital requirements. Irish banks have some of the highest capital requirements in the EU due to the legacy of the banking crisis, but credit unions have even higher requirements, despite them not being the ones who caused the banking crisis. I believe we had an opportunity to restore the setting of these requirements to primary legislation as we had done before the 2012 Act. As I understand it, this is something the Government has decided to leave as a matter for the Central Bank. I believe the rationale for turning the matter over to the Central Bank is that it would be more responsive to changing market dynamics and that it could effect changes faster than amending the principal Act. I have seen only a kind of slow process progress in this regard and it seems that the Central Bank has been far more cautious. The credit union sector has long talked about this. Representatives feel the sector has been stymied over the past decade because of poorly targeted regulation. They want to see the setting of requirements restored to primary legislation. Does the Minister of State believe that this is a missed opportunity, and that it is something we can discuss at greater length at committee level?	spk_168

Cuireann sé an-áthas orm an Bille seo a chur chun cinn le mo chomhghleacaí an Teachta Buckley. This is another significant piece of legislation we have worked on together in respect of the issue of public standards and ethics. It seeks to make important amendments to the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001. It seeks to make these amendments on the basis that the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, has asked for them. SIPO says they are required for it to better carry out its function. This amending legislation also helps to give scope to some major recommendations of the Mahon tribunal. It is also imperative in light of recent events. Yesterday we saw that the annual register of Members' interests was published, and we have seen the corrections that have had to be made. I will explain the three major provisions of the Bill. First, it will make it an offence for Oireachtas Members willfully and recklessly to fail to disclose their required interests. Currently, Members are merely required to correct the record with no potential sanction for failings in their duties. This is not a sufficient deterrent to revealing the issue of potential conflicts of interest. It would also widen the definition of registrable interests to include liabilities above a certain threshold. That would be excluding the mortgage on the family home. This is one of the key recommendations of the Mahon tribunal where the issue of guaranteed loans that were not repaid was identified as an area of particular concern. Second, the Bill would introduce a new section into SIPO's governing legislation titled ""Suspected contraventions"". This would allow SIPO to initiate its own investigations without the current requirement that applies in many instances for a complaint first to be referred to it before an investigations officer can be appointed.This would allow SIPO to be more proactive in certain instances, allowing it to act where it feels suspected breaches of the ethics framework have taken place. If, for instance, it felt something was not declared, it could investigate it and sanction members if necessary. Third, it would require SIPO's annual report to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Under the current arrangement, it must be presented to the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform before it is laid before the Houses. This is something SIPO has requested on multiple occasions. Of course, much more work needs to be done in this area, but this Bill, if enacted, would be a significant step in the right direction, in an area in which we have been going backwards for some time. It gives me great pleasure to introduce the Bill to the House."	spk_260

Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-02-14	dail	33	Cost-of-Living Supports: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_11	"I saw yesterday how the Government was in celebratory mode. It was celebrating that Ireland has the fastest growing GDP in all the EU. I am sure this news must have come as great comfort for all of those currently struggling to pay their bills. I am sure all those anxiously waiting for the eviction ban to be lifted must have slept a little easier last night. I am sure spontaneous street parties broke out among the 11,000 citizens who are homeless. In the mind of this Government, the boom times are getting even boomier. I am sorry to burst the Minister's bubble but nobody outside of this out-of-touch Government would embarrass themselves by cheering about our headline GDP numbers at a time like this. Maybe Fine Gael has forgotten about the phenomenon known as ""leprechaun economics"", but the rest of the State has not. Here in the real world, we have families who have to go without certain daily necessities like heat, food and electricity. We have people on low and fixed incomes who have been pushed to the pin of their collar because of inflation. We have renters terrified that the eviction ban is ending and they cannot find alternative accommodation because - guess what? - the Government has not supplied the required housing. That is why we would introduce a spring bonus for those on working-age payments, including lone parents, pensioners and people with disabilities. We would extend fuel allowance eligibility to working family payment recipients to reach families who are in work but are on very low incomes. We would extend the eviction ban so that those who are currently terrified of losing their homes can sleep a bit easier. We would also grant relief to those whose mortgage costs have exploded with the recent ECB interest rate increases. We know that the Government can help those who are struggling. It cannot in one breath tell us how well the economy is performing and then in another, tell us the funds are not there to support very vulnerable people who are being pushed to the pin of their collar because we are talking about real lives. Sometimes we get caught up in statistics but these are people who are really struggling and hurting."	spk_235
Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-02-08	dail	33	Mortgage Interest Relief Scheme: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_14	The ECB hiked interest rates four times in 2022. It has already hiked rates this year and it is still only February. In line with its policy of forward guidance, it has already indicated that it intends to raise rates by another 50 basis points in March. That means a crisis for many mortgage holders. The Minister will be aware, and I am sure that people tell him in his clinics, in his local shops and at the butchers, about the real pressure they face as a result of these rises. These are people who are now coming off fixed rates or who had been on tracker mortgages. They are seeing sharp increases in their payments and they simply do not have that additional money to spend. They do not know where they are going to get it. Obviously, these hikes will not be applied universally across the board. There will be different rates depending on whether the person is on a variable, tracker or fixed rate. It will also depend on who is their lender. However, we do know that many people are experiencing this impact at this very moment. For instance, we know that the average tracker has increased over the last nine months, from just over 1% to 4.1%. For someone whose mortgage may have been sold to a vulture fund, they could have rates of more than 7%. This is really impacting them in terms of thousands extra that will be required for their mortgage repayments. That is why we are bringing forward this motion. It proposes a timely, targeted and time bound relief measure for all those people who are really struggling at this moment. We believe this can be done, and on an affordable basis. It will help those people who are struggling at present. It only applies to the principal primary residence.As such, we are not talking about providing relief to landlords or people with second or third homes. This motion is focused on those who are struggling to afford to get by. Since it uses an interest reference rate applied to a mortgage loan in June 2022, the relief would be based on the difference in the interest payments between the reference rate and the higher interest rate in 2023. This means our butchers, shopkeepers and others in our communities who are struggling to pay their mortgages and other bills would get some kind of relief. We need to be clear that we are listening to them about the struggles they are facing.	spk_268
Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-01-31	dail	33	Post-European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_14	The Jenin refugee camp is home to more than 22,000 Palestinians. These refugees were expelled from their original homes in 1948 during the Nakba. Last week, the Jenin refugee camp was subject to another attack which has been described as a massacre. Ten residents, including two young children, were murdered. The Israeli attack was reminiscent of a previous large-scale assault on Jenin in 2002 when Israeli undercover forces dressed as civilians entered the camp in private vehicles with Palestinian numberplates and proceeded to kill more than 50 Palestinians over the space of 13 days. During last week's raid, Israeli forces in a military vehicle drove into the camp and proceeded to kill ten people, with one of the children who was killed having been run over. We know that the Israelis have form in this, as the late Rachel Corrie was also killed in this manner. However, that this would happen to a small child is an unimaginable horror. After unleashing the attack, the Israeli forces proceeded to shoot at ambulances in order that they were prevented from treating the wounded. They fired teargas towards the Jenin public hospital, which then seeped into the children’s ward. A fortnight ago, the President of the European Commission, President von der Leyen, said it was imperative that we maintain the positive momentum of EU-Israeli relations. I ask the Tánaiste whether he raised these horrors at the European Council meeting. If not, will he ensure he raises them at the next meeting?	spk_146
Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-01-31	dail	33	Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_16	When our young people and children ask for help we should be able to give them the support they need. We are very lucky to live in a society that has become far more open about mental health and mental health struggles. It is good to see that a generation of young people are growing up who are willing to speak out and say when they need support. It is devastating, therefore, to see so many children failed by the very body that is meant to help them. Different issues with CAMHS have been laid bare again in recent weeks. We need to see urgent action to ensure that children and adolescents get immediate care when they need it. CHO 2 covers some of the west, including Galway. It is deeply disturbing that last November there were 247 children on waiting lists in CHO 2, with 40 of them waiting over 39 weeks, including eight who had been waiting over a year. In 2023, we are all well aware that early intervention is crucial. It is heartbreaking to see children and their parents left waiting, not knowing where they are supposed to turn. It is part of a larger issue with mental health supports in Galway. Jigsaw services in the county have a waiting time of 17 weeks, the third longest waiting time in the State. It is deeply concerning that the position is so bad in CAMHS and Jigsaw. It is important that we make clear to families and children that they should turn to these supports in their times of need but we also need to ensure we are dealing with the issues. Tuigeann muintir na Gaillimhe cé chomh deacair is atá sé an chabhair a dteastaíonn ónár bpáistí agus ónár daoine óga a fháil ó CAMHS. Tá sé feicthe agam go bhfuil 247 páiste ar liostaí feithimh, le 40 acu ann níos faide ná 39 seachtain, agus ochtar acu ann níos mó ná bliain. Nuair atá a fhios againn cé chomh tábhachtach is atá idirghabháil luath, tá sé dochreidte go bhfuil sé seo ag tarlú agus is rud maith é go bhfuil daoine óga sásta labhairt faoi na deacrachtaí meabhairshláinte atá acu. Áfach, caithimid a chinntiú go bhfuil na seirbhísí ann dóibh, na seirbhísí Jigsaw agus CAMHS san áireamh, agus caithimid a chinntiú go bhfuil siad in ann an chabhair a dteastaíonn uathu a fháil.	spk_193

It seems to be an issue of resources. Could that be looked at specifically for those councils where the process is taking a longer time? These days, unfortunately, when people are applying for housing supports, it is often because they are in a crisis. I have dealt with people who have had housing assistance payment, HAP, rental properties secured but have not been able to get their applications processed in time to get the HAP and keep the property.	spk_197
Mairead Farrell	42	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2023-01-24	dail	33	Forestry Sector: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_21	The reason we are here is not because we oppose investment in the forest sector, which is badly needed, but because of the type of investment. The State through Coillte should not be incentivising or underwriting investments for vulture funds at the expense of family farm incomes or viability. There are also legitimate concerns that investment by such vulture funds will inflate the cost of land, as it has done in other sectors like housing. Local farmers in rural communities could be priced out, just as many renters have been priced out of living in the areas in which they grew up. This is a bad deal that facilitates the sale of thousands of hectares of Irish land to a British vulture fund and the Government is again doing its all-too-familiar innocent bystander routine. It is remarkable that Coillte’s annual reports make constant reference to the need for shareholder approval when it comes to big decisions like this one. Who are its shareholders? Where are they hiding? They sit on the Government benches of this Chamber. They are the Ministers, Deputies McConalogue and Donohoe. The former appoints the board and sets out its terms of office in writing. The board’s responsibilities include the approval of contracts in excess of a value of €1.5 million, approval of disposal of assets in excess of €2 million, and managing investments in excess of €3 million. The current deal establishes a fund of more than €200 million. Will the Minister confirm that he vests his confidence in the board and the approval of this decision? It is a board the Minister appointed and which he has the power to remove. It seems to me this is a bad deal whatever way you look at it. It is curious that a public-spirited board would want to enter into such a deal. This comes from a Government which recently produced a White Paper about how it wants to support indigenous businesses. What will Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil’s next bright idea be? Will it be selling off our rivers and streams? The Ministers need to put a stop to this. The people are against it for valid, clear reasons. If the board will not listen to the Ministers, then they need to tell the board what is what.	spk_390

Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-12-13	dail	33	Confidence in Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage: Motion	dbsect_14	It is incredible to hear the Taoiseach suggest that when he hears anger from the Opposition on the issue of housing, it is rehearsed anger. If I ever needed any more clarity of the Government's attitude towards housing and how it simply does not get it, it was from the Taoiseach here tonight. I heard the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who is also missing, suggest that Opposition parties are engaging in divisory politics; that it is old versus young; urban versus rural. If this Government has done anything, it is to unite people in urban and rural areas and older and younger people all under the same issue of not being able to access secure and affordable housing. It is impacting the people in our cities and rural areas and it is even impacting people on our offshore islands. It is not just impacting young people. It is seriously impacting older people. I see people coming into my clinic in their 50s, 60s and 70s who cannot access housing. A man who is nearly 70 was paying over €1,000 extra over HAP. He knows that once he retires, he will not be able to afford that any more. There was a week in Galway city when six households were turned away from emergency accommodation. That resulted in six people having to live in their cars and three in tents. Coming up to Christmas, there is no room in the inn for Galway city homeless and there certainly are no wise men in this Government who are going to do anything about it.	spk_342
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-12-13	dail	33	Appropriation Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_20	Before I begin on the Appropriation Bill, I note that this might be the Minister's last occasion to address the Dáil as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I thank him for being very constructive throughout his term and I wish him all the best for the future. The purpose of the Appropriation Bill is to give statutory authority for the amounts voted by the Dáil during the year. The appropriation of sums voted for supply services this year is just over €75 billion. The Bill also provides for the definitive capital carryover facility from 2022 to 2023. Generally, money that is not spent goes back to the Exchequer, but due to changes in the Finance Act 2004 we have a facility to carry over unspent capital into the next year. This year we will be carrying over about €687 million. Capital expenditure has been rising in recent years as set out in the national development plan. This is to try to address our infrastructural crisis. The IMF, OECD and EU have all pointed out the weakness of our public infrastructure  Of course, none of this will be new to the Minister. Earlier we debated a confidence motion arising from in no-confidence motion in the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, as a result of his failure to get to grips with the crisis. In many ways the Appropriation Bill or rather the capital carryover facility highlights the weaknesses of the Government's approach. It has failed to address the capacity constraints facing the construction sector. As capital expenditure has risen, so too has the capital carried over each year. In 2020, €710 million was carried over. In 2021, this rose to €820 million. I recognise that the figure is lower this year but I think other factors like the use of the inflation co-operation framework have played a role here. I also want to be constructive. The Minister is departing for the Department of Finance and some of what I mention might have more relevance for his successor but some are measures he could enact in his next role. There has not been enough effort to redirect the construction workforce towards residential construction. As has been pointed out this evening, in 2000 our construction sector workforce was 138,000 strong and in that year just under 50,000 new homes were delivered. In 2022 the size of the construction workforce is 168,000. That is 30,000 more workers and yet we might not even turn out 25,000 new homes this year. Something has clearly gone wrong. While I would normally recognise that changes to the tax system are not in his remit, he is soon, of course, to become Minister for Finance and will have the power to use the tax system to redirect the workforce. From the perspective of the public finances, failing to do so is totally self-defeating. Let me give a concrete example. In 2011 total public expenditure on the various housing supports like housing assistance payment, HAP, rental accommodation scheme, RAS, homeless supports, the capital loans and subsidy scheme etc. was €627 million. In 2020, nine years later, the latest year for which I could get data, that had increased to €3.6 billion, a 480% increase which is hardly a prudent use of scarce resources. If the workforce had been directed towards building more homes the Government would not need to be spending so much on these subsidies. I know the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform first began examining how to promote modern methods of construction for which it deserves credit. I note that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has also taken up that mantle, presumably more in terms of wider industrial strategy. The Tánaiste's new White Paper outlines a desire to drastically increase the productivity of indigenous firms such as those engaged in construction.Those are obviously laudable aims but are they credible? The White Paper is remarkably scant on details of how to do many of the things that it is proposing. It talks about using the public procurement process to support innovative SMEs but this State has no history of using public procurement for strategic purposes. The focus here for the contract award criterion has traditionally been lowest price and I am not aware of any changes being outlined for new procurement legislation that is in the pipeline.  I do not want the Minister to misunderstand me as I would obviously welcome such a thing were it forthcoming, but I have seen very little progress in this regard. I have been engaging with multiple local authorities across the State to assess how many modern methods are being used and am aware that Dublin City Council has made some good efforts but it is the exception rather than the rule. Without some new plan for the public procurement system whereby we can create the demand for these kinds of services, this will remain an aspiration rather than a real plan for transformation. Only recently the Construction Industry Federation pointed out that less than a third of SMEs win public work contracts. One can think of the innovative SMEs doing modern methods of construction using things like off-site manufacturing, modular and prefabricate build, using the likes of building information modelling, and things like precast concrete; and they are really struggling to win public contracts. There are only 100 of these kinds of SMEs in the State but only a quarter deliver full housing solutions. That is because we have not used the State as the largest spender within the economy to create that kind of demand. Many of those SMEs engaged in modern methods have now turned instead towards building data centres, which seems completely on its head. Unless the Minister or his successor uses the public procurement system to really promote modern methods of construction, it will take years before it reaches widespread adoption and we will continue to struggle with capacity issues. If we use the procurement system to create the demand, contractors will seek to supply that demand. I would like to give a concrete example. Building information modelling is mandatory in all public works contracts in Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and many other countries. The use of building information modelling is therefore widespread in these countries. It is not mandatory in public works contracts here, even for large projects of over €100 million and that is something that could be done immediately with ease. This would speed up the pre-construction phase of development. Data I received recently on the average amount of time local authorities spent on the pre-construction phase of development were astounding. Cork City Council spent an average of 155 weeks in the pre-construction phase and that is not far off three years which, of course, is absolutely bonkers. The Minister could bring in an amendment tomorrow to make building information modelling mandatory above a certain level and I thought of doing so myself but, as we had this discussion in the past week, I have had difficulties in having my Bills progressed due to the money message provision.  We are also failing on the apprenticeships front. While I recognise that the Minister’s Department is not responsible for that, his Department has taken the lead in promoting modern methods of construction. I recently submitted a parliamentary question to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science which was on the back of a report it had carried out on the kind of new apprenticeship places we need to develop. Thus far there are no apprenticeship places in modern methods of construction. There are no college or university places offering training in this regard. Often, it seems to me, that when it comes to this Government, the left hand does not seem to know what the right hand is doing.  How can we really improve construction sector capacity through modern methods of construction when the education and training places simply do not exist? I know that there has been much detail in my contribution there but, in fairness, a great deal of work needs to be done. If all of these measures were enacted it would not be revolutionary but rather, moderately evolutionary. I still believe that more radical action is again required. I will be bringing forward in the new year a very substantial piece of policy work that I have been working on over the past eight months. President Higgins recently stated that the key to solving the housing crisis was for the State to build public homes on public land, and he is dead right on that. The Government seems to have tried every conceivable market-based solution and in the new year I will be bringing forward my own proposal, including much of what I have outlined there this evening.	spk_407

Rents continue to increase. We saw the astounding figures yesterday relating to how much they have increased since 2010. It comes as no surprise that people are finding it impossible to live in the cities. Many have to commute further and further. The lessons we learned from Covid-19 about having a work-life balance have been knocked on the head. The reality for many teachers is that insecure, temporary contracts have a massive impact. We have all seen it in our families and among our friends. People have to move from one end of the country to the other end to try to find a place to work. This is not a new issue. It is not just affecting our cities; it affects our offshore islands as well. There used to an allowance of more than €2,000 for teachers living on our offshore islands who might only get a few hours a week in a particular school. They used to get a small allowance to move there or to help them with the commute, which is obviously a difficult commute. However, that allowance was taken away. I have raised this issue previously and it needs to be examined. Another issue I feel strongly about is that some islands, such as Inishbofin, do not have a secondary school. I have been trying to raise this issue in the Chamber for some time. Children who are leaving primary school have to move onto the mainland.

Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-11-29	dail	33	Toll Charge Increases: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_16	I will focus on public private partnerships on large public infrastructure projects. PPPs have frequently been used for large infrastructure and in social housing, healthcare and education. Today they represent a €11 billion liability for the State. The PPP model of delivery often promised that it would bring great benefits, including better value for money, accessing private finance, greater efficiency from private sector management and risk transfer whereby risk from delays and cost overruns transfer to the private investor. However, these supposed benefits often simply do not materialise. Not only that but the additional costs are often left with the public. This experience has mirrored the disappointing results elsewhere. As a result, PPPs have attracted a bad reputation. A 2018 study by the European Court of Auditors found that PPPs frequently produce considerable delays and major cost increases and had weak transparency. Research by economists Dr. Eoin Reeves and Dr. Donal Palcic, by housing expert Dr. Rory Hearne, by the former chief economist in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Paul Sweeney and by the Comptroller and Auditor General have had similar findings. We often see aggressive tax avoidance through the use of special purpose vehicles, SPVs, and holding company structures and creative accounting. I will give a concrete example, namely, the PPP for the M4 motorway. In 2014, the company that carried out the work changed how its turnover was reported. It went from measuring turnover on the basis of toll revenue and other payments to a profit margin on operating costs incurred for the year and a return on the financial asset of the company based on future cash flow projection. In one fell swoop, this reduced its reported turnover from €29.5 million to €21.2 million and more than halved its corporate tax bill. Nevertheless, PPPs remain a part of the national development plan and a key part of Housing for All. Those are the major concerns. The Minister of State and I are in the same constituency and we often have to go through those tolls. I heard the Minister Deputy Eamon Ryan say at the weekend that 10 cent is not a lot of money but when we see all the bills rising, 10 cent then is considerable. 	spk_394
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-11-23	dail	33	Transport in Galway and Other Areas: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	Galway city traffic has been an issue for as long as I can remember and it does reputational damage to the city, nationally and internationally. When a person mentions they are from Galway, it is often the butt of a joke. As Galwegians, we know when traffic will be worse and we always factor that into our daily commute. While reputational damage is frustrating, what is really frustrating for those people is the real-life impact on their lives as a result of the traffic. For a person living on one side of the city and working on the other, the lack of public transport options, particularly the lack of direct links across the city, is truly shocking. Other elected representatives and I have long been calling for more frequent bus services, particularly at peak times, affordable fares and a modern and more efficient approach to ticketing. Four weeks ago, I talked in this Chamber about university students living in Connemara because of the lack of affordable or, indeed, any accommodation in Galway city, who are missing morning lectures as there is no bus that will get them in on time. We do not have a suitable and effective public transport system in Galway. I have heard reports from the east and west of the county, as well as from the city, of people being left on the side of the road because buses were full. Another issue we have is that those bus stops are often not suitable or sufficient for modern-day Ireland. We know it will rain and we know people will be waiting at bus stops, but we do not have proper protection for them. People in Galway see announcement after announcement about new night services on bus routes in Galway, while we are still waiting for a single night bus in Galway. This is despite the fact there is a proper campaign seeking night services in Galway. The aforementioned students, who rely on public transport to go out in the evening, would benefit from such a service. People who are no longer able to live within Galway city limits, because they cannot afford it and have moved outside the city bounds, would benefit from a night service, as well as the many people who work night shifts across the city and county. I have seen two recently proposed housing estates in Galway city being denied planning permission because the location of the site is deemed to be too car-dependent. This raises the question why there are places in Galway city that do not have access to public transport in 2022. A 90-minute fare can be bought in Dublin so that if a person needs to transfer, he or she is not required to pay a full fare twice. Many commuters in Galway need to get from one side of the city to the other for work. It is impossible do this by bus without getting a transfer, which leaves them paying two full fares per journey if they choose to commute by public transport. Compounding this issue is the fact that on the west side of the city, people are reliant on a privatised bus service. If residents wish to use public transport, they have no other option but to use the private service. This presents a problem if we want to bring in a 90-minute fare for Galway. As it stands, people in Knocknacarra would have to pay a higher fare to get a private bus to the city centre and then pay a full fare on a public bus to reach their destination on the east side of the city, and this is completely inadequate. The people of Galway deserve so much more in terms of bus services. While bus services are extremely important, especially for people within the city bounds and those coming from rural and isolated areas, they are not the only tool needed to improve public transport in Galway and across the west. We have to prioritise reopening the western rail corridor and provide rail links for communities along the west coast. We in Galway have been waiting for a feasibility study to be carried out. My great granddad worked on that rail corridor, so my extended family are acutely aware of the role it has had and could have. Opening the western rail service would no doubt enhance the travel options for people across the west, as well as allowing more people to live in the more rural and isolated areas, so that there is not an intense, continuous pressure on our cities such as Galway city. We have also seen that a decision on the ring road has once again been delayed. This has been going on for several years. At this stage, many people feel completely frustrated by the lack of progress. The most frustrating thing is that often all else is left in anticipation of a decision on this road. Without it being progressed, little else is happening. I ask the Minister of State to take on board my suggestions.	spk_28
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-11-23	dail	33	Social Welfare Bill 2022: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_17	Cuirim fáilte ar ais romhat a Cheann Comhairle. Bhí tú sa Chathaoir cúpla uair ó shin. I will raise a few matters with the Minister. We have always had quite a good, constructive relationship. However, I need to respond to some of the points raised by an Teachta Cathal Crowe. He is not present in the Chamber. He is well able to dish it out but whether he can take it is a whole other question. The world and its mother can grasp Sinn Féin's pensions policy but clearly an Teachta Crowe cannot. I am more than happy to explain it to him so that he can grasp it. I also note his concern for the people of the North. It is refreshing to hear that from Fianna Fáil but, as far as Deputy Crowe is concerned, I am sure that it is all chat and absolutely no action. Again, it is disappointing that he did not hang around to hear some of the responses to his claims and his excitement. I will return to a few of the issues I would like to raise with the Minister. The issue of cohabiting couples is one I have also raised with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, during the debate on the Finance Bill. As the Minister for Social Protection knows, cohabiting couples are assessed together for social welfare purposes but it is different when it comes to tax reliefs. Married couples get the tax relief but cohabiting couples do not. In fairness to the Minister for Finance, I had quite a good engagement with him on it. He said there were some issues in respect of certain court cases. It would be an interesting measure to look at, however. I note the Minister for Social Protection said in her statement yesterday that she had tried to take on board some of the suggestions made last year. It may be worth looking at the fact that cohabiting couples are assessed together for social welfare purposes but not when it comes to tax relief. That just does not seem fair. This is increasingly becoming an issue. Since I raised it, more people have contacted me regarding it. It raises real issues for those who are cohabiting. For example, one woman contacted me who was cohabiting with her husband while they went through a divorce. Of course, the housing situation means it is more difficult for people to be able to leave but the divorce was not on amicable terms and the joint assessment required by the Department of Social Protection made life very difficult for her because of her situation. As her soon-to-be ex-husband did not engage with this assessment, she was caught in limbo and was in a difficult financial position. This situation has also arisen a number of times in respect of pensioners and so on. Given the fact that cohabitation is treated differently in terms of tax and social welfare, it would be an interesting to see whether it could be considered for next year. I will also flag the waiting times for claims. Other people have also raised this issue. I know of one lady on disability allowance who was reassessed and had to wait two months to get her payment. It is obviously backdated but the point is she was left in a very vulnerable position.	spk_215

Tá sé fíorthábhachtach. The first time that long Covid was highlighted to me was approximately two years ago. When I heard about it, it really knocked me for six when the woman in question detailed how much it had impacted on her life. Ever since then, I have raised the issue in this Chamber and through parliamentary questions because the people who have been suffering from long Covid have raised it with me. I commend all those people and the campaign groups who have continued to keep this on the agenda.We know, of course, that Covid-19 caused a global pandemic. People everywhere recognise the severity of the virus. Now we see that some of those people who, when we were told we could stay at home, had to go out to work, whether it was in healthcare settings, stocking shelves in our supermarkets or in our factories, providing vital services on which we relied in order that we could stay at home and stay safe, are suffering from long Covid as a result of that work. They feel totally forgotten about now. We all know people who have been affected and impacted by long Covid. I wish to read out something one woman told me about her experiences with long Covid. She said:The worst thing about having Long covid is that nobody can tell you when you will recover. If you have a broken limb you know it can take 6 weeks to heal, a chest infection can take a week with antibiotics but with long covid there is no magic pill and no time frame for recovery. You cut back on expenses as much as you can but still can barely manage. And it gets you down as you can't plan anything as you don't know when you'll be well again and able to return to work and have your normal income back. And worrying about bills etc causes more stress which exacerbates your already debilitating symptoms. We know how difficult people with long Covid are having it and we need to listen to what they are asking for. It is really good we are having this discussion but, really, we needed to have it two years ago. It is far too late to be having it. We need to act on this now because so many people are not able to get the help and supports they need and they are really struggling.	spk_37

Bhí fadhbanna leis an maingainéis ar Inis Bó Finne agus sa Spidéal le tamaillín anuas agus cé go bhfuil siad réitithe sa Spidéal bhí fadhbanna i gcomhair i bhfad. The water issue on Inishbofin has been ongoing for a number of months. With the lack of clarity on whether the water was safe to drink, there was a boil notice which was changed to a do not consume notice. The islanders still have questions and have not received answers. While this particular issue has been ongoing for a number of months, in reality there have been problems for years. A long-term solution is needed.  Islanders have complained about issues with immersion boilers and electric showers. Water services on our offshore islands require a long-term solution and strategy. I understand that is not something that can happen overnight, but it is something we could do far better on and we need to focus on. One islander I spoke to today told me she had travelled to North Macedonia to view its water services. She heard it had not had rain since last March. It is a far less well-off country than Ireland, yet has been able to provide fresh water. It was interesting to hear that comparison. Caithimid déileáil leis na deacrachtaí uisce atá ann ar na hoileáin amach ón gcósta. Teastaíonn straitéis fadtéarmach ina leith. Tuigim go dtógfaidh sé sin tamaillín ach caithfear déileáil leis agus caithfear breathnú air. Má bhreathnaímid ar Inis Oírr, mar shampla, samhradh i ndiaidh samhraidh bíonn an t-uisce múchta i rith na hoíche agus sin fadhb ollmhór, ach go háirithe ós rud é go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó turasóirí ann agus chuile rud. Léiríonn sin go gcaithimid déileáil leis. Ansin tá an fadhb séarachais ar Inis Mór. Feicimid go bhfuil séarachas fós ag scaoileadh amach ar Inis Mór agus tá baol mór ann ó thaobh sláinte de freisin. Caithimid breathnú ar an gcóras séarachais agus ar na fadbhanna uisce ar na hoileáin amach ón gcósta. Teastaíonn straitéis fadtéarmach dóibh sin ar fad.	spk_247

I have not seen the housing crisis as bad as it is now in Galway city in a very long time. We are having a crisis in all the different strands relating to housing. We are not seeing supply come on stream. People who have been on the housing waiting list for 15 years have had no offer of accommodation. There is nowhere to rent. If the Minister of State went on  Galway is a university town with NUI Galway and the Atlantic Technological University, ATU. Students are coming in who have nowhere to go. They are being told to go out to the countryside and see if they can find a place to live. First, that is extremely expensive and, second, there is nowhere there either. Even if they were to find somewhere, there are no buses to bring them into their lectures on time. There were media reports yesterday that there are 30 students in Galway who have been unable to get to their lectures in NUIG on time because a few Government crises have come together: accommodation and transport. The buses that are supposed to be bringing these students in on time are not doing that. It is affecting everyone in Galway: those who have literally nowhere to go; the students who are trying to learn; and everyone in between who is trying to support these families. It is simply not good enough.	spk_28
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-10-25	dail	33	Finance Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_12	"As I only have four minutes, I will only focus on one particular measure but I look forward to engagement on Committee Stage. I want to focus, therefore, on the vacant homes tax. It is something which we have long been calling for and is something which, on the face of it, most people would probably welcome. We know that we have a significant stock of vacant homes, which we can see from just going through our towns, cities and rural areas. These number 166,000 according to the recent census. We know this adds to scarcity but also creates an artificial scarcity of supply, which helps to drive high prices and rents.  We also know that tax schemes for vacant homes have worked well in other countries. It has brought stock back into use while generating revenue to reinvest in vacancy and dereliction. On the face of it then, this measure should be welcome but unfortunately, here the devil is again in the detail. The Government's stated intention is to incentivise those with idle property to bring it into use. But if that is the intention, then why design it in such a way as to make it so avoidable? Two legal experts have described this tax as “significantly compromised, to the point it could be considered virtue-signalling.” If we have a quick look at it, we can see that the tax is done on a self-assessed basis and that it would not apply to residential properties occupied for more than 30 days in a 12-month period.  But whether this is 30 consecutive days or not is not clear. Would it not be easy for the owner of this property to just say it is a holiday home, that they come and go for more than 30 days of the year, and then, hey presto, the owner is not liable for this tax? By remaining silent, would this still permit a situation where short-term letting could occur and then with the right planning, would the property still not fall liable for this tax? Again, that is not clear. Nor is it clear how Revenue will be checking tax compliance. Will it use the GeoDirectory data, the latest census or some other method? If we were serious, the first thing I would have expected to see was some big anti-avoidance clause jumping out at me from this particular measure, that is, some big deterrent that said to those thinking of deliberately dodging their tax obligations that there would be serious consequences There is also the fact that the charge itself is too low and does not increase with each subsequent year. The levy will be approximately 0.3% of the value of the property and does not automatically increase every subsequent year. In France, for example, the rate is 12.5%, which then doubles the following year. When the French introduced their tax in 1998, vacancy fell by 13% over the next four years leading to a significant increase in supply. We should contrast that with what we see here. Accountancy firm Deloitte recently noted that the impact of the Minister's tax measure on increasing supply would at best be ""modest” and from looking at this, I can easily see why. We can see from the Revenue forecasts how much tax it expects to generate from this and it is estimating that around €3 million to €4 million will be brought in over the year. If one considers that an average-priced house would pay around €945 per annum, then at the lowest bands of the Revenue's estimate of €3 million raised, this would equate to around 3,200 liable homes.That is simply not good enough. If this tax was a boat, it would have so many holes in it that it would not be able to sail from Malin Head to Mizen Head. I will seek to thrash that out on Committee Stage."	spk_253
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-10-20	dail	33	Regulation of Lobbying (Amendment) Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_34	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire. It is welcome that we are discussing the regulation of lobbying. We need to be realistic about this. People's faith in the public and political system is at an all-time low. That is because of the behaviour of certain people. When people look at this Chamber and the debates that take place here, even though numbers of them voted for every one of us, they do not feel they have the same level of influence on their locally elected politicians as certain specific interests may have. It is important for us as elected representatives to realise that. It does not mean everybody in this Chamber is engaged in any kind of activity or anything like that. The point is that if this is the perception out there, then it is something we need to face head on and tackle. Two years ago, my colleague, Deputy Doherty, and I brought forward the Regulation of Lobbying (Amendment) Bill 2020, which would have done much of what SIPO had asked to be enacted. I was only elected a few months at that point and a number of scandals had already hit that totally eroded people's trust and confidence in public and political life. While I welcome this discussion and the fact that the Minister is moving on the issue, I am bitterly disappointed that when my colleagues and I brought forward our Bill two years ago, in September 2020, instead of supporting it, the Government decided to kick the can down the road. It is not good enough that we are only now discussing the issue. Sometimes, when we look at how things work in other countries, we may think to ourselves that at least we are not as bad as they are at this moment in time. We can all bring such a comparison to mind today. However, when we look at the issue of lobbying in this country, my concern is that it is only going to get worse, not only in terms of the public perception but also in respect of the influence certain vested interests have. The Legislature is supposed to agree and enact legislation that is of benefit to the vast majority of people. It is not there to facilitate certain key interests. We must bear this in mind when looking at the great issues of the day.At this moment in time, people are really suffering because the legislation has not been there to benefit the majority of people. A lot of the time, that is the actual crux of the issue for me. I look forward to engaging on this particular legislation at committee level. I must say, it has been very good that we have been able to engage constructively with the Minister at committee level. The Minister has taken on a lot of the different suggestions that we have made over a period of time. I hope to see that, and I am sure that I will see it, with this particular legislation. There are a number of issues I want raise in particular. One of them is the cooling-off period, which caused one of the many scandals that we have seen in lobbying. It is definitely one of the main rules with which we can close that revolving door. It is there to prevent former insiders from being able to trade on their influence. As we know, under the current rules, there is no sanction for breaching the one-year cooling-off period. I believe the current period of one year is too short. It is clear from international best practice that a two-year period is seen as being absolutely crucial. We know that SIPO has called for a such a period of time. When we had a discussion on lobbying previously within our own committee, that is what the experts recommended. It is also what the report of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach recommended. It is also exactly what the Bill I brought forward two years ago would have done. It is an issue we can discuss further on Committee Stage. We will thrash it out. However, I think it is unfortunate that at this point the Bill will not extend that period to two years. We are finally going to see a breach of the cooling-off period being made an offence. I absolutely welcome that. I must say it is startling that it was not there initially. I just do not understand how it could have happened that a breach of that period was not made an offence. I cannot understand that, especially given that SIPO has told us time and again that it needs to happen. There has been failure to act for years. It is good that it is going to be included in the legislation, but how it got to this point is beyond me. What is the point in having a cooling-off period if there is no sanction for disregarding it? Under the Sinn Féin Bill, a breach of the cooling-off period would have been a criminal offence. That is exactly what SIPO recommended. Unfortunately, the Government has gone for a lesser sanction in the form of a civil sanction. We will discuss that on Committee Stage, and I look forward to that discussion. To be honest, my fear is that it is not a strong enough deterrent. That is my concern at this point. We know that under the legislation, certain people will be granted special exemptions from the cooling-off period. I am concerned that the Government is not going to require the names of those who are granted special exemptions to this cooling-off period to be made public. They should be made public in order that it is very clear to people exactly who has been granted special exemptions. I must say, I am not sure why that is not being done. We know that SIPO has been allowed to publish these details in the same way that we know that the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has also called for it, and my own Bill has provided for it. It is really crucial. It is definitely something that I would ask the Minister to look at. I think that could be good. One of the things I have never understood since being elected to this House is how previous Members are permitted special access all the time. It is something I just cannot comprehend. It means that if I were to lose my seat overnight, and I am sure Deputies would be devastated if that happened, I would still have access. I think it is outrageous that former Members can become lobbyists and have access. At the end of the day, there is a particular reason we talk about the corridors of power. It is something we definitely need to look at. We know that the report of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach specifically recommended that this be removed. It is something that needs to be looked at. To be honest, I think if people were aware of it, they would really be astonished. I also want to mention the Government's decision to extend the review period from three to five years. The Minister mentioned it in his speech. He might even pick up on it later or we can discuss it again at committee level. The review period is being changed from three to five years. My concern about that is that lobbying activities and tactics change all the time. A few years ago, nobody knew that there would be such a thing as the Internet. We know the confusion and difficulties that can cause. I think we need a shorter review period in order that we can move with the times. That is where my concern is in relation to that. We need to be agile to move with the times. Things can change very quickly in this area. It seems to me that if we are extending the review period, we are making it less reactive than it could be. I hate using the phrase because it is so overused, but I think this is a missed opportunity. I believe the Minister fully understands the issues that have been noted with regard to the Regulation of Lobbying Act for a long time. He is clearly willing to make amendments to strengthen it, but this Bill really does not go far enough. There is a lot of work to be done on Committee Stage to strengthen it. The committee will come together and it will be done. We debated the Sinn Féin Bill on lobbying. I think that was a stronger Bill and it would have been better if that Bill had been enacted, particularly given that it was two years ago and so many different things have happened since then. We could have done with a strengthened lobbying Bill. My core point is that we need to make this Bill as strong as possible in order that we can restore confidence in public and political life and, crucially, make sure all the decisions that are made at every level within this Chamber are made for the benefit of the vast majority of people. We must ensure no one can say at any point that decisions were made just for a few because certain people had certain access and were able to use that access to influence decision-making. We are here for the vast majority of people. We need to recognise that and we need to have a lobbying Bill that is as strong as possible to ensure that remains the case.	spk_290

One of the most formative experiences of my earlier political life was the beginning of the Iraq War in 2003. That was a war built on lies. It is estimated to have killed between 500,000 and over 1 million people. The final chapter of the war and the resulting occupation was only closed in December 2021. It was the opposition to the launching of the Iraq War that convinced me of the need for our neutrality. I was not the only one as over 100,000 people took to the streets of Dublin and Belfast to protest that illegal invasion. However, it is what I have learned since that has shown me the need for our neutrality to be protected. I am shocked and outraged by the members of this Government who want us to join NATO and want to send our Defence Forces to war. We would do well to remember that when this State canvassed for a seat on the UN Security Council, we made it clear to non-aligned countries that we would be champions for peace and pointed to our long and proud record of peacekeeping. Now that we have won the seat, however, we seem to want to renege on our neutrality and I just do not get that. The vast majority of people are in favour of neutrality and I am proud of our neutrality. I for one, along with other Members of this House, will stand with many other people across this State, not quietly but loudly, to demand our continued neutrality.	spk_245

I will have got my commission and the person I sold to will have sold on and neither of us will be held accountable when something goes wrong. After studying finance I worked in banking and derivatives. This was always in the background. When we began looking at these particular proposals, it came to mind again. The introduction of a new financial regulation with an emphasis on individual and personal accountability and responsibility is very welcome. We cannot have a situation where financial professionals who have engaged in wrongdoing and failed in their fiduciary duties can hide behind a corporate veil. We recognise that we live in an era of financialisation when financial markets and institutions are gaining greater influence. We now have banks that are seen as being too big to fail. In advanced countries the banking sector has become concentrated. This provides it with significant power. Our banking sector concentration is high even by international standards. With great power there needs to be great accountability. The Minister's new framework will introduce new conduct standards. It will enhance the existing fitness and probity regime. It will lay out the individual responsibilities of each senior executive and strengthen the Central Bank's administrative sanctions procedures. This will mean that individuals can be pursued directly for their misconduct as opposed to general participation of a firm's wrongdoing. I welcome these changes. I have a query and the Minister can correct me if I am wrong, which I am sure he would. From what I can see the Bill only applies to certain customer-facing firms. This would mean those non-bank firms engaged in bank-like activities, that is, shadow banks, would not be included. Let us consider the size of the shadow banking sector compared to our domestic banking sector. In 2021, the sum total of the assets of AIB, Bank of Ireland, KBC, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB was €343 billion while the size of the shadow banking sector is estimated to be in the trillions of euro. It has approximately €4.6 trillion worth of assets under administration here. Directors of these firms will not be held to the same standard. I worry this is a major weakness in the Bill. We know from the financial crash that many large banks used shadow banks for a variety of reasons. They are not mutually exclusive. There can be the creation of grey areas where regulatory arbitrage might occur and enforcement issues could arise. If we take a securitisation transaction, when a bank makes a sale of a portfolio of non-performing mortgage assets to a special purpose vehicle, SPV, if there is a lack of clarity on the legal ownership of the collateral in this situation, the legal title to the security is splintered into many hands. This makes enforcement difficult. I would like the Minister to address this in his response. I am concerned that a similar problematic enforcement situation could occur with the senior executive accountability regime. Senior executives of banks will be under the regime but the directors of a connected SPV will not. If some wrongdoing were to happen that was part of a complex chain of transactions involving various SPVs, and that wrongdoing occurred at the level of a vehicle, would the senior executive at the bank be able to credibly say it was nothing to do with the bank and to take it up with directors of the nominally independent firm? Those directors would not be under the senior executive accountability regime. This is an issue. I have more points but I am running out of time and this is the particular issue I would like the Minister to address his closing remarks."	spk_273

Bhí an Teachta Ó Dochartaigh ag iarraidh a bheith anseo agus a ghuth a chur leis an mBille seo ach mar gheall ar an tragóid uafásach a tharla i gCraoslach, tá sé i nDún na nGall. D’ardaigh mé an cheist seo go rímhinic leis an Aire Stáit cheana agus bhí díospóireacht sách maith againn faoi. Tá sé ráite agam cheana ach déarfaidh mé arís é. Sílim go bhfuil toghcháin do bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta fíorthábhachtach. Baineann siad leis an daonlathas agus tugann siad guth do mhuintir na Gaeltachta sna cinntí a dhéantar don Ghaeltacht, dóibh siúd atá ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht, atá ag iarraidh filleadh ar an nGaeltacht nó atá ag iarraidh bogadh ar ais chuig Gaeltacht. Tuigim go raibh athbhreithniú á dhéanamh ag an Aire Stáit. Nuair a d’ardaigh mé an cheist seo roimh an samhradh, dúirt an tAire Stáit go raibh sé ag obair ar an athbhreithniú sin. Beidh mé ag súil le cloisteáil ag cén pointe a bhfuil sé sin. Ag an bpointe seo, teastaíonn na toghcháin. Dúirt an tAire Stáit go raibh sé ag súil go mbeadh sé críochnaithe i Meán Fómhair nó roimh an gheimhreadh. Táim ag súil le cloisteáil faoi sin. Dúirt an tAire Stáit ag an am go ndearna an Roinn comhairliúchán poiblí. Tá comhairliúchán poiblí fíorthábhachtach ach ag an bpointe seo tá cúrsaí sách soiléir, fiú ó na toghcháin a bhí againn in 2020. Chonaic muid gur tháinig dreamanna le chéile sna ceantair Ghaeltachta ag lorg na dtoghchán seo. Sin cuid mhór den chomhairliúchán poiblí a tharla ag an am sin. Tá an Bille seo i ndáiríre ag iarraidh tuilleadh cumhachtaí a thabhairt don Aire Stáit chun a chinntiú gur féidir linn na toghcháin seo a bheith againn. Mar a dúirt mo chomhghleacaí an Teachta Ó Snodaigh ar maidin ar Raidió na Gaeltachta, fiú má tá deacrachtaí ag an Rialtas leis an mBille seo, is féidir athruithe a thabhairt isteach ar Chéim an Choiste. Tá sé fíorthábhachtach go mbeadh muid in ann oibriú le chéile mar sin agus an Bille seo a chur os comhair an choiste. Má tá deacrachtaí ar leith ag an Rialtas is féidir linn déileáil leo ag an bpointe sin. Tá daoine ag fanacht rófhada ag an bpointe seo i gcomhair na dtoghchán. Tar éis an méid a bhí á rá ag an Teachta Ó Snodaigh faoin gcúlra agus an stair a bhí agus atá sa Ghaeltacht maidir le cearta sibhialta, tá sé i ndáiríre dochreidte go bhfuair an Rialtas réidh leis na toghcháin seo. Mar is eol dúinn, tá deacrachtaí ar leith ag ceantair Ghaeltachta agus teastaíonn an guth seo agus an daonlathas seo uathu. Ag breathnú ar mo cheantar féin mar shampla, má tá daoine nó monarcha nó mar sin ag iarraidh bogadh siar go Conamara, tá deacrachtaí ollmhóra ann ó thaobh bóithre agus droichid agus ar na hoileáin, mar gheall ar chéibheanna. Tá an t-infreastruchtúr bunúsach sin sna cathracha ina labhraítear Béarla de ghnáth ach níl sé sna ceantair Ghaeltachta. Sin an fáth go dteastaíonn an guth ar leith sin agus go dteastaíonn an daonlathas i dtaobh toghchán do bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tá súil agam go dtacóidh an tAire Stáit leis an mBille tábhachtach seo.	spk_278
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-10-12	dail	33	Community and Voluntary Sector Workers: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	"Gabhaim buíochas le Páirtí an Lucht Oibre agus leis an Teachta Duncan Smith as an rún seo a chur os comhair na Dála. Tá sé fíorthábhachtach go bhfuil an rún seo á phlé againn inniu. I also thank and commend the trade unions for their representation of these workers. I commend the amazing work of our friends in the community and voluntary sector, some of whom are here with us today. It is essential that we have this debate and this conversation within the Dáil but it should not just end as a conversation. Something must come out of this. I note the Government is not opposing this motion but there is a difference between not opposing something and supporting it. Every single one of us who lives and works within our communities knows that the community and voluntary sectors are the unsung heroes of so many of our services. That includes our health services but many others as well. Although they are not technically part of the public sector, we are acutely aware that the public sector would not be able to function without them. In many instances they are performing services comparable with those in the public sector and, in some instances, they work closely with those in the public sector but do not enjoy the same pay and conditions. There is an incredible unfairness at the heart of all of this. Many of these workers suffered pay cuts at the time of the financial and economic crisis. The Minister said that FEMPI did not technically apply to community and voluntary organisation but we know that in reality, those pay cuts did apply for many of them. There is no technicality around the restoration of that pay and those conditions. We know how that happened in practice but I often think about how one Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform was able to bring in those pay cuts. We need the current Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform here today to also look at how we can bring in pay restoration for these people and workers, as the economy has got back on its feet, to recognise everything they have done. They have been forced to take industrial action and to fight. They have had to lodge pay claims with the Workplace Relations Commission and they have been asked to do more with less and for less. I think of the fantastic work that has been done by the likes of the rape crisis centres, Enable Ireland and many others and the real difference they have made in people's lives. They have done this because they are driven by conviction and the desire to make a difference in people's lives. They have made a difference and they know that because families tell them this and we see it ourselves. Unfortunately, this has been met by indifference on the part of the State. That needs to change. This all comes down to one crucial aspect. Something I have long tried to get my head around since being elected is the relationship between these organisations and the State. I welcome that the Minister is here. As he has recognised, many of these organisations fall under different arms within the Government. There is not a one-stop shop for who exactly everything falls under or which income streams apply to them. The Minister stated that there are at least 83,714 staff in these organisations. I have submitted questions, as have many others, to find out exactly how many people fall within these organisations and exactly where different funding streams come out of. If we actually want to look at this collectively and take this approach to it, we need that kind of information. The Minister says this is the latest data available to him. I would love to see exactly where those data come from and I will submit a follow-up question directly to the Minister's office to see that. This is information that many within Sinn Féin, as well as the trade union sector and other parties, have tried to get. I wanted to say something specifically to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform but I will bring that directly to him. It relates to his Civil Service renewal strategy and the establishment of a national data infrastructure. The strategy states that this will ""unlock the power of administrative data and improve the lives of the Irish public through evidence informed policies and effective services"". When we have a situation like this where we do not actually know how many workers there are within these services, we need to take a serious approach to this and look at that initiative."	spk_34

The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Connolly, is bringing it forward with Deputy Ó Cuív and me. Everyone is singing from the same hymn sheet on this. There is an issue with recruitment, particularly in the area of physiotherapy. This needs to be looked at on a wider international scale. This facility is of great importance. If we are looking internationally for other places, we also need to do that in this case. As Deputy Ó Cuív stated, we also need to push the new facility forward.

Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-10-05	dail	33	Public Transport: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	Ar dtús ba mhaith liom an bus oíche a ardú leis an Aire Stáit agus seo ceist atá luaite go sách minic agam sa Seomra seo. Tá dhá líne nua curtha le bus 24 uaire i mBaile Átha Cliath agus cuirim fáilte roimhe sin ach tá gá le bus oíche i nGaillimh freisin agus ar fud an iarthair. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an bus 424 ag taisteal níos déanaí anois agus gur féidir le daoine, mar gheall air sin, dul i gcomhair béile agus dul ar ais abhaile ach teastaíonn tuilleadh busanna cosúil leis seo agus teastaíonn a leithéid in iarthar an chontae freisin. There are several matters I wish to raise with the Minister.One issue I have raised a number of times in the Chamber is that of a night bus in Galway. While the 424 service is now running later, there is a need for increased night buses, specifically in the eastern part of the county. There are two new lines for 24-hour bus services in Dublin, which is very welcome, but we need to see the same level of support in more rural areas, for example, for students who cannot find accommodation in the city and have to travel out further, as well as for people who are working late at night. We know people will use public transport if they have the option. I see that on the Galway-Dublin bus, which is packed. Speaking of the Galway-Dublin bus service, it is an outrage that the 20-X20 service was cancelled. It provided a vital service for people in rural areas to travel to Dublin. Another issue I want to raise is the western rail corridor, on which there has been a long campaign. It was a fantastic rail service for the west. My great grandad was a train driver on the western rail corridor, so my family is acutely aware of the importance of the service. Again, when there is a rail service available people will use it. If we are serious about people using public transport, we need to make it affordable but we also need to make it accessible. Unfortunately, it is not accessible for the vast majority of people in rural Ireland. For students living outside Galway city, making it to college by 9 a.m. using the bus service is not realistic in many cases. That needs to be addressed.	spk_31
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-10-04	dail	33	Housing for All Update: Statements	dbsect_10	I wish to raise three specific issues with the Minister of State concerning the housing crisis and how it is impacting on Galway. One can only describe the housing situation as grim. It is completely and utterly grim for families and of course individuals. It used to be the case that if you were 11 years on the housing list in Galway city, you had a fair chance of being offered something. Increasingly, I have people coming to me who have been 14 years on the housing list in Galway City and they have never once been offered a place to live. That is stark. The other issue I raise is people who are availing of HAP and getting notices to quit. This applies to both Galway City Council and Galway Country Council. I have heard mention here that councils now apparently have the ability to buy all the houses where people are served notices to quit. I would love nothing more than to see that happen because I am seeing notices to quit rising and rising for people who are on HAP and the council cannot buy those houses. It is a really serious issue because those people are being pushed into homelessness. There is not the capacity for all these people who are homeless. The third issue I raise is typified by two single men who have come to me in recent times. They have had their rented accommodation be massively increased in price. These are people in their 50s and 60s. One of them is in shared rented accommodation. One has seen his rent increased by 20%, which is of course not allowable in a rent pressure zone, but what is he going to do? He knows there is nowhere else for him to rent and he will end up in homeless accommodation. Another fellow is getting his rent raised from €105 per week to €120 per week when he is on €208 per week. What is he supposed to do? How is he supposed to live? How is he supposed to heat and how is he supposed to eat?	spk_187

Therefore, when people of my age say to me that there is nothing for them here, that there is no chance of them ever owning their own home or that they are not sure what to do about starting a family because they just cannot afford to, it is because of the political choices that the Government has made over years and it is because of the political choices it has made today. The reality is that this budget was never written with our young people in mind. It was written by a government that is out of touch and it shows. This is certainly no budget for young people and young families. We see no meaningful action to solve the housing crisis, no meaningful action on climate and too little on childcare. This budget says to our young people that once again they are being brought up for export, the mantra of successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael governments. The Tánaiste used to speak about creating a republic of opportunity. It is remarkable that many people now see this as an opportune moment to emigrate. It was never written to keep our young people from emigrating or to give those who have left the opportunity to come home. In some parts of today's presentation, it would appear that the Ministers have spent the weekend rummaging through our wardrobe, stealing our clothes, but unfortunately rather than a fashion upgrade, it appears to be something of a wardrobe malfunction. The outfit they have chosen does not match and they have their shoes on the wrong feet. While I welcome that they have borrowed some of our proposals, unfortunately in some instances they have weakened them, watered them down or simply made them unworkable. We acknowledge that in recent times the world has suffered several shocks - Covid, inflation, an energy crisis and, of course, war. Individually each of these has been highly significant. Cumulatively they have been even more so. However, we have a cost-of-living crisis which long predates these shocks. Many will watch today to see what decisive action the Government has taken on affordable housing, stopping rent increases and real delivery on childcare costs. The fashion in which taxation and expenditure are deployed helps to test whether the Government's obligations to its citizens are met. These can be new measures used to tackle a new crisis, like the energy crisis that families are facing, or they can be long-standing proposals. Many of the best proposals to tackle the more long-standing problems we face have rarely been given a chance because they are opposed by certain special interests who benefit from the  A Sinn Féin government would today offer help in the short term to deal with a freezing winter. We would offer certainty in the medium term and hope in the long term that not only could things be better but indeed they would be better. Bhí deis ar leith ag an Rialtas inniu, cinnteacht a thabhairt do theaghlaigh agus do ghnólachtaí. Bhí cinnteacht ag teastáil maidir le laghdú ar bhillí leictreachais, i dtaobh praghas cíosa agus i dtaobh tithíochta. Bhí fadhb ollmhór againn le costais mhaireachtála fiú roimh an gcogadh san Úcráin mar gheall ar chostais arda chúraim leanaí agus tithíochta. Tá mé ag breathnú ar na rudaí atá á ndéanamh leis na costais sin a laghdú sa cháinaisnéis seo agus ní fheicim mórán cinnteachta. Tá sé go maith gur éist an Rialtas linn i dtaobh airgéad a chur ar ais i bpócaí cíosaithe, ach mar a dúirt siad féin, muna mbíonn bac ar ardú ar phraghas cíosa ar feadh trí bliana anuas ar na creidmheasanna, tá baol ann go gcuirfidh sé seo le praghas cíosa mar a chuir an scéim cabhair le ceannach le praghas tithíochta; scéim atá le leathnú amach ar feadh dhá bhliain eile.  Tá an Rialtas ag caint ar laghdú de 25% ar chostas cúraim leanaí. B’fhéidir gur cinneadh maith a bhí ann é sin a dhéanamh sular thosaigh an boilsciú ach ní leor anois é. Bliain i ndiaidh bliana, feiceann an pobal na geallúintí a dhéanann rialtas de chuid Fhianna Fáil agus Fhine Gael ar lá na gcáinaisnéise ach is minic nach bhfeictear toradh ar na ngeallúintí sin mar nach sroichtear na spriocanna a leagtar amach. Beidh le feiceáil an uair seo. The cost-of-living crisis families and businesses are facing this winter should be the number one priority for the Minister. Not only should it be the number one priority now, but it should have been for months. The priority should be to provide certainty around energy prices. Crucially, we would provide a cap on the price of electricity. This is needed urgently to provide the kind of certainty that households require. It is the kind of certainty that households in other EU countries will receive. This would return electricity back to its summer 2021 costs. Importantly, we would also bring in a windfall tax. We must decouple gas from electricity prices - something we have long been calling for, but it is something the Government in its infinite wisdom opposed last year. The Government has decided to go down the energy credit route. This will not work. The credit provided could quickly be overtaken by price increases and then hard-pressed families will still be left worrying. They could still be left with an awful choice of having to decide whether to put food on their table or to keep the lights on. This is why our proposal creates greater certainty. This is also why we have proposed an emergency cost-of-living crisis package that recognises the scale of the crisis. This would also include emergency one-off cash payments to middle- and low-income households. This is the kind of certainty that households need, whereby they know exactly what they will be liable for this winter and can plan accordingly. As the Aire is aware, we have long waited for a real and fundamental change to the cost of childcare. It is now widely accepted that the cost of childcare really is the equivalent of a second mortgage. We know this because families tell us. In Galway, young couples tell me that they are paying as much as €50 a day for childcare services. In Dublin, we know that the average monthly fee is €810. The Minister's proposals will not exactly wow young couples. It pales in comparison to our proposal to reduce fees by two thirds. This would bring the average fee I mentioned to €270. The Government's proposal only reduces it by a quarter. If the Minister had enacted the proposal before the current bout of inflation it might have been seen as a welcome step, but in the current environment it is nowhere near enough. Also, it will not be a major incentive for those young people who are considering emigrating, who have been putting off starting a family because of the high cost. The measure will not stop childcare being a second mortgage. The Minister has slightly reduced the cost of the second mortgage, but a second mortgage is still a second mortgage. For those parents who have young adults leaving for college for the first time and have had to pay the student contribution charge, which is essentially fees by another name, there is a €1,000 reduction this year, as we have proposed also. This must be the first step towards eliminating fees. We must work towards genuinely free third level education. Next year, people will find their fees going back up. The Aire will have heard of people having to defer their dream course because they cannot find accommodation. A third of those who deferred their course in NUI Galway this year did so because they could not find a place to live. I worry that the accommodation situation is unlikely to get better next year. Indeed, I am concerned that it will get worse. We hear the stories of students. One student from Offaly says he has commuted up to six hours a day to reach UCD from Offaly, and he knows lads who travel from Longford daily. He is weary. He is in final year but he cannot face it and is deferring. Students will be camping out in Eyre Square tomorrow evening to highlight this crisis. I will be joining them. They need delivery on housing. We see a €12 increase in core social welfare rates. That is inadequate and adds little to an already inadequate social protection scheme. The sum of €12 does not protect from inflation. It does not even come close. It does not protect people from poverty, and it does not recognise the impact of the cost-of-living crisis on those reliant on fixed incomes. The fact that the increases will not be introduced until January beggars belief. I did not believe it when I saw it and heard the Minister say it today. Instead, carers, people with a disability, lone parents and older people will wait for another four months for weekly increases. These are the households that are already living in poverty and making choices between putting food on the table and turning on the lights, yet the message is that their weekly fixed income will not change until January, despite them currently living in a frighteningly fluid situation. This is why we called for an immediate €15 increase, rising to €17.50 next year for working-age payments and pensioners living alone, and €20 per weekly disability payments. Every year, some things stand out in budgets. I will never forget sitting here last year listening to the two Airí across from me announcing measure after measure, only to realise that once again they had forgotten the renters of this country. There was not a mention of them. Renters were left baffled and astonished that the Government had taken no action to alleviate the great pressure they were under. I will never forget that their initial proposals for renters was that they had decided to link rent to the rate of inflation, which was obviously a very bright idea at the time. Thankfully, due to the fact that most people saw that this was nonsensical, there was a U-turn on that one. Let us imagine where renters would now be if that had happened. For them, the cost-of-living crisis was well under way this time last year. We already had some of the highest rents in Europe, but all of that was ignored. Renters need certainty and that is what Sinn Féin will bring them. We would cap and reduce rents. We would put one month's rent back in renters' pockets and we would ban rent increases for three years. It does seem the Minister has finally seen the light on this one and sought to introduce this measure, which we have been proposing for several years. Unfortunately, in the Government's characteristic style, it has failed to grasp how the measure should be implemented, although the Minister did point it out to us when we raised it. However, he has not taken the appropriate steps to ensure that it will not be inflationary. He has taken a solid Sinn Féin proposal but then watered it down. To be clear, the renter's credit might have been a month's rent a decade ago, but for many it is not even a fortnight's rent. Perhaps that is the problem - the Government does not know what people are going through in the here and now. The most glaring omission is a failure to instigate a ban on rent increases, as we have been calling for. Introducing a credit without a cap will be inflationary and as the Minister told us, it will cause rents to rise. He even recognised it. His failure to ban rent increases means that no sooner will this money enter the pockets of renters than it will have gone back out and into the pockets of landlords. How could the Minister get it so wrong? I suppose that should not be a surprise, as the Government has been getting it wrong on housing for years. It is what the President, Michael D. Higgins, aptly described as ""our great, great failure"". To be more precise, it is the Minister's great, great failure, although it could perhaps be his great, great achievement. It must be listed as an achievement that in just over a decade he managed to push house prices back above Celtic tiger levels. There is a saying that something always seems impossible until it is done. My God, how the Minister has done it. We already had the highest property prices in the EU and the Minister is hell-bent on keeping it that way. This has locked so many out of home ownership. People are trapped in a rental cycle where rents consume more and more, possibly even much more than a third of people's income. After people have covered all their other expenses, there's little left to save for a deposit. Compounding this problem is the fact that rents keep on rising. The cost of renting in Ireland rose 76.7% between 2010 and 2022. People are forced to chase a moving target. While people are running and trying to keep up with rents, a speed bump of any size can throw them off the track and result in homelessness. The Ministers must know themselves that the housing situation is getting worse. They must hear about it in their clinics and offices and get stopped in the streets by people trying to help families on the brink of homelessness, with the answer continuously coming back that nothing can be done. It came as a surprise to us all when earlier this year the Tánaiste said perhaps it was time Fine Gael had another go at housing. I ask, seriously, what more damage the party could do. We know what Fine Gael does when it comes to housing. Whereas Fianna Fáil follows the dreams of the developers, Fine Gael follows the dreams of the investment funds. That is who has been the inspiration for the housing policies. It was bad enough that the funds were buying up so much of the stock of new homes but now we are learning that they are buying up huge amounts of second-hand properties. On Sunday, the We told the Government the exemptions on apartment blocks would make it unworkable, but again it dismissed us, claiming it was mere populism on our part. Once again, however, not only are they still bulk-buying new homes but they are now making large purchases of second-hand homes too. We have heard about landlords fleeing the market and we are seeing that smaller landlords are fleeing. Accidental landlords who had buy-to-lets that were previously in negative equity are leaving, but who is stepping into their place? Investment funds. For God's sake; how bad will it have to get before the Government realises these investment funds are a blight on our society? Then we come to Housing for All, the big plan for supply, supply, supply. The targets for the delivery of social and affordable homes were seriously lacking in ambition to begin with, but even those lowly targets keep being missed and I can bring the Ministers to Galway to show them that. Let us recall the recent census figures showing thousands of vacant homes in this State. We hear the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is bringing in a vacant property tax, so cheers to that, but the time to have done this was long ago. When it comes to housing, the choice is clear. Do we want a housing system where a house is a home, somewhere to raise young children, to grow old and to make fond memories, or do we want our housing system to be an asset class, filled with odd-sounding acronyms for different investment vehicles, which I will list and get wrong, such as IREFs, ICAVs, CIFs and CCFs. The Government has committed to reviewing some of these, but what is there to review? I could go on but we get the picture. The choice is clear. Do we want housing based on human need or a financial asset class based on speculative greed? When it comes to our health system, the sad reality is it is neither healthy nor a system. In some ways, it mirrors the housing crisis; both are a failure in planning and a failed ideology that has damaged public services. It is not working for those who need it. Waiting lists continue to grow while people wait in their thousands for medical care. The trolley crisis continues to get worse and again, on Friday, 69 people were on trolleys in University Hospital Galway, something we honestly thought would not happen again post Covid. The health system is also not working for the hard-pressed healthcare professionals toiling night and day to try to keep the show on the road, which is why Sinn Féin would deliver a national health service over the space of ten years. We would place dignity, respect and fairness at the heart of healthcare and labour relations, and we are not in the business of making promises we cannot keep. The Government has spent only an additional €20 million on disability, whereas we have provided for €152 million, and that is appalling. It outlined just an additional €14 million for mental health, which is shocking, while we have provided for €81 million because that is what is needed. As I said, we do not make promises we cannot keep and any of the measures we have announced are based on realistic, deliverable targets. We have seen on multiple occasions the Government make health-related announcements that are not delivered. Its GP announcement sounds good, but when GPs woke up this morning, it was news to them. We all heard the GP on the radio this morning stating he had no idea how his fellow GPs will cope if the Government’s proposed measure goes ahead. I hope this is not the Government looking for praise in the absence of proper preparation because we recall the promise to deliver free GP care to all children up to 12, which was legislated for three years ago and never happened. Big announcements without planning are doomed to fail, as we saw in the case of staffing and beds. In budget 2021 and in last year's winter plan, just over 1,200 beds were provided for, a quarter of which have been funded but not yet delivered. The Minister could not deliver what he had funded because there is not a plan. The increase announced today for acute services equates to less than one-tenth of the increase for our hospitals. The figure is so low it has left me wondering whether it is true. There is not a red cent for a new hospital bed; it seems the Government has no plan for that either. I just hope the expanded free GP care will not go the same way because a lot of people have heard about it today and are hoping they will get the support. It is a case of rising expectations but falling standards. Workforce planning in our healthcare system is key and has too often been neglected. We would tackle the issue of capacity and we recently published a substantial document that sets out a roadmap that would bring us from the current situation of long waiting lists to quicker turnaround times, from poor system capacity and an overworked, underappreciated workforce to a properly functioning system, where healthcare workers are given the dignity, the respect and the pride of place they deserve. Sláintecare is nominally supported by every party in this House but, in effect, the parties on the Government benches have not shown any intention of getting us there. We need a national health service. We need to end the two-tier system. We need healthcare just as we need housing, as a basic human right. The other key issue of our day, which both Ministers mentioned, relates to climate. I find it funny when people say we in Sinn Féin are weak on climate, but it is weak criticism when it comes from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, Government parties that have presided over one of the worst performing countries in terms of meeting emissions reduction targets. Targets are missed and we do not appear to be making much progress, and the Government's big solution, the carbon tax, has done nothing to change behaviour. As we have told it countless times, and as I know as someone who represents a rural constituency, tax can change behaviour only when there is an affordable alternative to which people can change, so we should not cut bus services. Let us think about this for a moment. The plan was to increase the price of carbon, thinking everyone would run out and buy expensive electric vehicles, but the energy crisis has pushed the price of carbon far higher than the carbon tax ever did. I know that the people coming to my clinics, and I am sure the people who go to the Ministers' clinics, have not been magically able to afford electric vehicles, which often start at €40,000. In fact, they cannot even afford to retrofit their house. We need a fairer retrofit scheme that will lift people out of energy poverty while reducing emissions. A lot of families are locked out of the retrofit scheme because they do not meet the criteria for a free energy upgrade under the warmer homes scheme, nor do they have the cash reserves to afford a deep retrofit under the one-stop shop scheme. Not only have we provided about €100 million more than the Government has for retrofits but we would completely overhaul the system. We would establish a new retrofit scheme for middle and low-income households, with area-based components. If all our funding were for deep retrofits, it would deliver approximately 6,000 deep retrofits for those who are currently locked out. Under this scheme, households earning up to €75,000 would be entitled to different levels of funding, from between 100% to 60% of the cost of deep retrofits, depending on household income. Our second new retrofit scheme would be for solid-fuel households. A total of 10% of households rely on solid fuels, mainly in our rural areas, and theirs tend to be the poorest, coldest and most carbon-intensive homes. We need a targeted scheme for these families. Our final scheme would be based on tiered retrofit support for higher income households. This would reform the current one-stop shop scheme, which provides the same level of funding for deep retrofits irrespective of means. Under our reformed scheme, we would provide different levels of support ranging from 55% to 5%, with a cap on incomes of more than €130,000. We believe that if we want to protect against fuel poverty, to improve the energy efficiency of our housing stock and to make serious inroads in our climate targets, these schemes are necessary. As it stands, many households need €25,000 in cash before such a course of action can even be considered, and this locks many middle and low-income families out of the equation. Our budget has also made significant provisions for accelerating the transition to renewable energy and this is through investment and the proper resourcing of the planning system to speed up the development of offshore wind generation. We have heard plenty of times that Ireland can become a leader in wind energy and we would like to see this dream realised. We too would provide for solar panels for schools and we have the legislation ready to go to alleviate the planning issues, so the Government should talk to my colleagues Deputies O'Rourke and Ó Laoghaire about that one. Families also want the opportunity to put solar panels on their roofs, as we all hear about in our housing estates, and we would provide grants for that. Unlike the Government’s approach, which provides the same level of grant for all households, our scheme would provide different levels of funding, ranging from 100% to 10%, again depending on household income, thereby improving affordability for solar PV for those who would benefit the most from lower bills. We need to make public transport affordable and more accessible if we are serious about driving down emissions, and that includes people in rural Ireland. They need sustainable transport options including rural bus services and rail such as the western rail corridor. Perhaps it is not Elon Musk driving a Tesla, but it is what rural Ireland badly needs. We would also like to see serious polluters, such as private jets, pay a €3,000 pollution levy per departure. We need to be ambitious in our climate targets and we need to deliver on them. Sinn Féin is proposing climate-action measures that will both improve people's lives and reduce carbon emissions.The times are changing. The people gathered in their thousands last weekend to say that enough is enough. They can see a better and brighter future ahead. People will again gather in their thousands this weekend to reimagine the Ireland in which we live and to consider a new Ireland that will put citizens at the centre of decision-making - a united Ireland. I told the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform this time last year that the conversations on a new Ireland had already begun; they were happening in all parts of our communities and were only gaining momentum. I will tell the Ministers again. The people are in front of the Government on the issue of the constitutional future of this island. While the Government dithers and delays, the people are leading out in front. The Government has the opportunity to bring this forward. It can decisively set out the next steps on the road to an Irish unity referendum. Unity is the big idea of our time. There will be a unity referendum. There is no ""if""; the only question is ""when"". The Government should join us in the conversation. It should make space for everyone to be involved and lead out in front by the establishment of a citizens' assembly. Mar fhocal scoir, we have heard of A new republic is waiting to be born and it is already being imagined. It gets closer every day. This will be a new republic where equality, fairness, justice and unity are not just words that Government Deputies say because their public relations advisers think they make for a nice sound bite, but where these words are living, breathing ideals upon which a new republic will be built."	spk_23
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-09-15	dail	33	An Bord Pleanála: Statements	dbsect_31	It is good that we are having this discussion about the serious issues that have arisen surrounding An Bord Pleanála. These go right to the heart of our planning system. It is the biggest crisis in our planning system since the Mahon tribunal. It is important to remember the words of Mr. Justice Alan Mahon who said that the presence of conflicts of interest do not necessarily equate to corruption but it creates the conditions under which corruption can flourish. It is clear from what has been reported that the conflicts of interest were rife in An Bord Pleanála. There has been a litany of allegations of poor processes, procedures and practice, thanks to the work of the investigative site  We know that it is not reducible to a single individual or instance. However, the reality of this is that the board's code of conduct is perfectly clear in that those board members are forbidden from voting on decisions in their own neighbourhood and must recuse themselves to ensure conflicts of interest do not arise and, yet, we have a clear pattern of this being breached time and again.  How is it that we become reliant on an online news site to make these things clear for us? Decisions by An Bord Pleanála are not irrelevant. These are decisions which literally impact on communities. How can we expect communities throughout this State, whose neighbourhoods often rely on the decisions made by An Bord Pleanála, to have in those decisions and in their being made in the best interest of the entire community? How can it be that, years after the Mahon tribunal, questions are still raised on the planning process in this State? How can people have faith in the system? I have only been a Deputy for approximately two and a half years and, time and again, we see issues with ethics. We see clear breaches of ethics. How can people have faith in the system? How can they believe that the system is actually working for them when all they see are cosy relationships, friendships and breaches of ethics? That is completely and utterly wrong.	spk_322
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-09-15	dail	33	Security of Electricity Supply: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_32	Is dócha nach gcaithim é a rá mar go dtuigeann gach uile dhuine sa seomra go bhfuil an t-uafás brú ar theaghlaigh agus ar ghnólachtaí. Tabharfaidh mé cúpla sampla don Aire mar gheall air sin. Bhí mé ag caint le gnólacht áitiúil i mo cheantar féin atá ar cheann de na hoileáin atá ann. Léirigh sé dom go bhfuil sé ag úsáid phainéil ghréine agus go bhfuil an fuinneamh ar fad atá ag teastáil uaidh á fáil aige ó na painéil sin. Léirigh sé freisin dom go bhfuil cuid dó sin ag dul ar ais chuig an grid ach is é an rud atá á rá aige ná nach bhfuil an ceantar áitiúil in ann tairbhe a bhaint as sin. Níl an ceantar ag feiceáil an bhuntáiste sin. Is rud fíorthábhachtach é sin a gcaithfimid breathnú air. Táimid ar fad inár gcónaí i gceantair. Tá comharsana ann agus ba chóir go mbeadh an tairbhe sin ann. As well as that, I have been speaking to some of the local businesses in my own area. I am talking about micro-businesses that are employing people in my area. They have all been saying that their electricity bills have increased by thousands of euro. This is not something new for this Chamber. We are all acutely aware of those difficulties that households and businesses are facing. Of the thousands of euro these businesses have seen in increases, many of them are saying that they have no certainty in relation to what is to happen over the coming months. To be honest, I have asked people directly because it is important for us to hear exactly what people are thinking and exactly what people feel would help them. One of those micro-businesses suggested to me that we make it easier for those micro-businesses, which do not have much money to spare, to get their own solar panels. There is two examples. One of them is the ceann ar an oileán a bhfuil sé acu cheana féin agus an ceann nach bhfuil sé acu go fóill. I have been contacted by a pensioner in Galway city who has just got a letter through her door from her landlord and who has been advised that her bills for heating and electricity will increase by 25%. She said that it is completely and utterly outrageous, and that there is no extra money for her at this moment in time. Therefore, we need to see that in the budget. What is extremely heartbreaking is a pensioner contacting me and asking what charities can she contact to get help. We need to see action from this Government. We need to see action to help those people, such as that pensioner, and make sure they can get through this winter.	spk_352
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-09-15	dail	33	Water Services (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_34	Unfortunately, I only have three minutes, which does not really leave room for everything I wish to say. It has been quite an interesting debate up to this point. I will use this opportunity to raise two local issues. They have been going on for quite some time and are very serious. It is unfortunate that it has to come to the point where they have to be raised in the Dáil. The people of Inishbofin were advised of a boil water notice on 25 August due to the level of manganese in the water. This was then changed to a do not drink notice on 3 September. Even more concerning is that it has now been revealed that as early as 11 August, the level of manganese in the water was not safe. Locals are worried because they feel there might have been an issue for some time with the water. Some have said that for some months there was a strange taste but now the water is completely brown. This water was being used by locals, even for washing bottles for a small baby, at a time when they had not been told that it was not safe to use if it had not been boiled. All of that is horrendous but the lack of communication from Irish Water is simply not good enough. Islanders have told me that they have found it impossible to get any information from the company. We know that our island communities are very-well organised to get this kind of information. I contacted Irish Water about this and was sent a press release that I could easily have gotten if I googled it. When it comes to the point of us trying to get some information, it simply is not good enough when we are talking about peoples' health. The boil water notice came in on 25 August but equipment and replacement filtration only arrived on the island almost three weeks later on 13 September. Islanders want to know why it took so long. They also need clarity from Irish Water on the exact level of manganese, when it started and an explanation of how much exposure islanders had to it before this was raised with them. Did this happen all of a sudden? Had it been building for some time? What exactly had been the problem with this system? All of these questions are still being asked by the islands. I understand that the Minister of State will not have all the answers to this issue now but I would be delighted if he could furnish me with a response at a later date. I will raise another Irish Water issue on Inisheer, which has been ongoing since last summer. There are nightly restrictions of water over summer months from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. I was on Inisheer at the weekend. What happens is that a cargo boat has to bring 10,000 l of water twice per day to the island. Usually there are 300 people living on the island. However, there are thousands there during the summer. That is not good enough. That boat should not be going. We need to make sure that there is a functioning reservoir for the island. We should think of all the rain that falls that could be collected. That is the kind of vision we need. Those are two urgent actions.	spk_458
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-07-14	dail	33	Summer Economic Statement: Statements	dbsect_37	As the Minister outlined, the summer economic statement is an important part of the budgetary process. It gives us the context ahead of the budget. Over the last two years our conversations at this time have been around Covid and the impact of the pandemic. Before that, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit dominated our conversations whereas this year the focus has shifted to record inflation. However, as we discuss the parameters for the upcoming budget, households across the State are also discussing financial matters and budgets. These budgets are their household budgets; they are talking money or more accurately they are discussing the lack thereof. Households are watching as the Dáil rises tonight and as we leave this Chamber until mid-September. Workers and families watch on in horror as they realise that there will be no further measures from the Government until the Dáil comes back from recess. We have been clear over the last number of weeks that what people needed before we got to this point, the last day of the Dáil session, was an emergency budget, to get them through this time. We brought forward proposals but these fell on deaf ears, except for last week. I laughed when the Taoiseach said that our motion of no confidence was a cynical move because I have seen many a cynical move from the Government. After weeks of the Taoiseach and various Ministers saying that they would not move and would not provide additional supports, at the final hour before our motion was to be tabled, the Government made the most cynical move and announced additional back-to-school supports. While that was welcome, it would have been better to have listened to and supported our measures, which would have included an additional 500,000 children in the back-to-school supports, but at least the Government acted on this occasion.  It is unfortunate that the Government has not acted on rents, which continue to increase, with families are pushed into homelessness and more than 3,000 children in emergency accommodation under its watch. It is also unfortunate that the Government did not act on home heating oil as people in the west rely more heavily on oil than other forms of heating. That is not because they want to but because they have no other choice. It is equally unfortunate that the Government did not listen to the whole suite of proposals that my party colleagues and I put forward over the last number of months. While we have one eye on the gate, people will continue to struggle and wonder how they will make ends meet because the Government failed to act adequately to support them Insín do na hAirí, agus muid inniu ar an lá deireanach de sheisiún na Dála go dtí 14 mhí Mheán Fómhair, go bhfuilimid ag seasamh sa Seomra seo agus ag plé cúrsaí airgeadais. Ar ndóigh, tá teaghlaigh fud fad na tíre seo ag déanamh an rud ceannann céanna ina gcuid cistineacha. Tá siad ag plé cúrsaí airgeadais a gcuid teaghlaigh nó an easpa airgid atá acu.  Nuair a théimid, ar bhriseadh, ní stopfaidh an plé sin. Beidh teaghlaigh fós buartha agus beidh go leor acu ag éirí níos buartha fós. Is mar gheall air seo go raibh muid i Sinn Féin ag rá le fada gurb é an rud a dteastaíonn ó daoine ná cáinaisnéis éigeandála, go raibh sé sin ag teastáil láithreach, agus nár chóir don Dáil dul ar saoire go dtí go raibh sé sin déanta.  Tá a fhios againn go raibh an ráta boilscithe chomh hard le 7.8% i mí Bealtaine. B’shin an ráta boilscithe is airde le 40 bliain. Tá praghas fuinnimh teaghlaigh tar éis ardaithe 57%, is é sin 41% ardú ar phraghas leictreachais, 57% ar phraghas gáis, agus 102% ar phraghas ola. Tá a fhios againn gurb iad muintir an iarthair is mó atá ag brath ar ola. Níl foinsí eile acu agus ní bhfuair siad cabhair ar bith don ardú praghais sin ón Rialtas seo.  Ceann de na rudaí ab breá leis an Rialtas seo a rá nuair a luaitear an ardú sa chostas maireachtála ná go bhfuil laghdú tagtha ar an bpraghas do thicéid bus. Is iontach an rud é sin ach céard fúthu siúd nach bhfuil bus ann dóibh. Ghearr an Rialtas seirbhísí bus i nGaillimh agus ní fiú caint ar seirbhísí bus faoin tuath mar nach bhfuil siad sásúil a bheag nó a mhór. Arís eile, is iad siúd atá faoi bhrú mar gheall ar an ola atá ag fulaingt arís mar nach bhfuil seirbhísí bus acu ach an oiread.  Ach, deirim leis na hAirí go raibh deis againn cabhrú le daoine. Chuir mé féin agus mo chuid comhghleacaithe rún faoi bhráid na Dála le moltaí simplí ach éifeachtach chun cabhrú le daoine. Bhí muid ag rá go soiléir go dteastaíonn cabhair ó chíosaithe. Caithfidh muid stop a chur le ardú cíosa ar feadh trí bliana agus creidmheas cánach a thabhairt dóibh atá cothrom le costas cíosa mí amháin.  Chomh maith leis sin, caithfear dleacht mháil ar pheitreal agus díosal a laghdú agus, faoi dheireadh, an rud céanna a dhéanamh le hola. Caithfidh muid airgid a chur ar ais i bpócaí na ndaoine. Tuairim is €100 a thabhairt dóibh siúd idir ioncam €30,000 agus 60,000, agus €200 dóibh siúd ar ioncam níos lú nach €30,000. Teastaíonn cabhair ó thuismitheoirí sula dtéann a gcuid páistí ar ais ar scoil. Bhí orm gáire a dhéanamh an tseachtain seo nuair a dúirt an Taoiseach gur cinneadh ciniciúil a bhí ann vóta mímhuiníne a mholadh, cé go ndearna an Rialtas an rud is ciniciúla a chonaic mé le fada an lá sa Seomra seo an tseachtain seo caite. Bhí an Rialtas ag rá le fada nach raibh sé chun tada a thabhairt do dhaoine roimh an gcáinaisnéis ach, ansin, nuair a chuir muid rún faoi bhráid na Dála Dé Máirt faoin gcostas dul ar ais ar scoil, shocraigh an Rialtas faoi dheireadh rud éigin a dhéanamh. Ach, ar ndóigh, ní raibh an Rialtas ag éisteacht i gceart. Seachas tacú lenár rún, rud a thabharfadh cabhair do 500,000 páiste sa bhreis, rud a chlúdódh 75% de teaghlaigh le páistí ar scoil, shocraigh an Rialtas gan an liúntas éadaí agus coisbhirt don scoilbhliain nua a leathnú amach do theaghlaigh eile.  Insím do na hAirí mar sin agus muid ag breathnú i dtreo an dorais chun dul ar ár gcuid saoire ón áit seo, go bhfuil teaghlaigh ar fud na hÉireann ag breathnú ina gcuid cuntas bainc, agus ag iarraidh orthu féin céard a dhéanfaidh siad idir anois agus deireadh mhí Mheán Fómhair chun bia a choinneáil ar a gcuid bord.	spk_251
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-07-13	dail	33	Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill 2022: From the Seanad	dbsect_14	We have been down quite a long road on this. It has been a very positive example of how the Government can engage with the Opposition and the relevant committee. The Minister has taken on board many of the suggestions put forward by me, an Teachta Buckley and others. That has been really positive. I am aware this is our last opportunity to speak on this. I thank the whistleblowers who have engaged with us over the course of dealing with this Bill. They spoke out for the common good. We have heard from the witnesses about the huge strain placed on them privately and professionally as a result. Throughout our discussions, we have grappled with the issue of retrospectivity, on which the Minister has just touched. Throughout his time dealing with the issue of retrospectivity, he has mentioned that he was seeking advice on it from the Attorney General. I was wondering whether it is possible to see this advice. Can it be shared with us? As the Minister knows, many of the whistleblowers we have heard from feel completely and utterly let down by the way they have been treated. I included my amendments because I do not believe it is right to exclude a section of whistleblowers. The section I am referring to includes those whom the Minister mentioned, namely those currently engaged in live proceedings. I fear the message they will receive from this Bill will be that they have been left behind again. They have been failed so many times and we must not let that happen again. The reality is that, throughout the committee hearings, we heard from whistleblowers about how they have been penalised. We should not exclude those engaged in live proceedings from this greater protection whereby any penalisation is presumed to have occurred as a result of the whistleblowing. The issue of the burden of proof is undoubtedly a fundamental aspect of the enhancement of provisions in this Bill and there should be an extension to the cohort in question. I would like to ask the Minister a number of questions on this. I understood what he was saying but have some questions I hope he can answer. We have spoken about the issue of retrospectivity at length. If there can be retrospective application for some, why can there not be for others? I understand this issue falls under Article 15.5.1° of the Constitution, as the Minister mentioned. It states the Oireachtas cannot declare that certain actions contravened laws that were not in place at the time of those actions.When the Minister introduced the amendments in the Seanad he said that constitutionally they could not include people who are before the Workplace Relations Commission or the courts. Will he explain why this is the case? I do not understand how it would be the case with Article 15.5.1°. I will give an example of where it was possible to make a retrospective ruling for a live proceeding. It was through the European Court of Justice in the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft case, C-684/16. The case was brought by the German court. After the termination of employment a company refused to pay the employee for annual leave not taken. The German courts were unsure whether the EU law precludes national legislation providing for the loss of paid annual leave not taken. The European Court of Justice ruled the employer must prove it gave the employee the opportunity to take the leave in the time allocated and particularly to have provided adequate information on doing so. The point is that the burden of proof lay with the employer and in this case it was granted in a live proceeding. Again, I question why this cannot be done in this case. Would the denial of this right lead to cases similar to the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft case? I was also struck when reading about the case that the German courts were unsure as to whether EU law precludes national legislation providing for this. Would this mean EU law has primacy over our domestic law and, therefore, the directive would have primacy here? Another issue I know the Minister is acutely aware of is that of reporting directly to the Minister. I want to mention this as the Minister spoke on it. It is regression not to have direct reporting to the Minister.	spk_316

Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-07-12	dail	33	Raise the Roof: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_26	The Minister said it is not a political game and I agree with him but to be honest, much of the time when I hear Government Deputies shouting about the housing crisis, I really think they think it is some kind of political game. The reality is that the housing crisis is as a result of political choices. That is why we are where we are. There is no denying that. It is because of political choices made by the previous Government, which the Minister supported, and by this Government. I am sure the Minister knows of, and everyone in this Chamber faces, the situation where every Monday at my clinic the key issue that comes through the door is housing. To be honest, it has become increasingly difficult to find any kind of solutions for the people coming in the door. Much of the time the people have notices to quit. We know there are rising numbers of notices to quit and the best the council can say to people is to apply for the housing assistance payment, HAP. The reality in Galway city, and I cannot speak for anywhere else, is that there are no rental properties available, let alone anything within the HAP limits. What are these families to do? We know the figures and the huge increase in the number of people who are in emergency accommodation. The reality for these people is that being faced with this prospect is a huge and terrifying shock for them. They really have two or three options. They can try to get emergency accommodation, much of which is substandard. I have seen the photographs from people who come to my office. They can try sleeping in their parents' sitting rooms or maybe on a friend's couch but that is all they have. It is getting worse. I hear about it in my clinics. On the points made by the Minister in regard to affordable housing, I would love him to come to Galway city and bring us the affordable housing. This is not about me wanting to win this argument. I do not want Sinn Féin to win this argument. I want the Government to deliver. For years we, in Galway city, have been hearing talk about an affordable housing estate. We are told that the earliest it will be delivered is 2024. It will not be enough for all the people who ask me if they can get an affordable house. To be clear, I am sick of hearing Fianna Fáil Deputies telling me that we object. Fianna Fáil has been objecting in Galway for years. The Minister should maybe check that out.	spk_604
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-07-05	dail	33	Defence Forces: Motions	dbsect_15	The position of my party and I on neutrality is completely clear. Deputy McDonald has already said that if she were to become Taoiseach, protecting our neutrality would be a key priority. Unfortunately the position of certain parties is not clear and is completely ambivalent. Fine Gael has at least been honest tonight and it has long been calling for a debate on our neutrality and joining NATO. I am shocked to hear some of the commentaries today that we are not ambitious enough, that we need to make a good account of ourselves, speaking of increased militarisation and talking tough. It has been suggested that pushing this agenda forward shows that we are proud of our Defence Forces. We are all proud of our Defence Forces and I would suggest that those who are saying we are proud of our Defence Forces should consider paying them properly. However, many of those who speak of increased militarisation and who call for the Defence Forces to be involved in a variety of situations and pacts do so safe in the knowledge that they will never have to pick up a weapon and stand a post or risk their lives fighting and dying in conflict zones. As far as they are concerned-----	spk_120
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-07-05	dail	33	Defence Forces: Motions	dbsect_15	"-----war is for other people. We know this Government is united in its support for PESCO. The reality is that a lot of people are not that familiar with PESCO but according to the European Defence Agency it is a tool to provide Europe with a ""coherent full spectrum force package, in complementarity with NATO"". The recent Commission on the Defence Forces mentions: ""Opportunities offered by the EU’s Permanent Structured Cooperation to develop Ireland’s defence capabilities"". It goes on to state that ""it is necessary for the Defence Forces to be trained and equipped to NATO standards"" and laments the fact that our ""current battalions do not align to NATO standards"". We have seen the accounts in the media detailing how NATO was in Cork in recent weeks supervising a military exercise. If you look at the review it is astonishing that it references NATO 48 times. It goes on to list three separate options for the future funding of our Defence Forces. The first, which is considered the benign option, would cost more than €1 billion per year. Option 2 is said to allow us to serve in higher intensity conflict areas and to deal with greater crisis management overseas and that would cost around €1.5 billion per year. Option 3 is the big one, which proposes to develop a full spectrum of military capabilities, which would cost around €3 billion per year. I look at things from a monetary point of view and €3 billion per year is a colossal sum of money. To put that figure into context it is around 75% of the annual budget for the Government’s Housing for All strategy. I know some of the speakers today are saying differently but the majority of people are in favour of our neutrality. They are proud of our neutrality and they want the Government to continue in that position. We continually hear people say they support neutrality and that they are proud of our status as a neutral country. They also say that it gives us an influence on the international stage and does good. I am proud of our neutrality and I hope we stick with it."	spk_122

Tá brú orthu mar gheall ar an gcostas maireachtála ach tá brú eile orthu anois toisc go bhfuil a fhios acu go mbeidh Meán Fómhair ag teacht go luath. Tá litreacha ag teacht isteach sa doras ag lorg airgid cheana féin agus níl an t-airgead sin ag daoine. Feicim an méid a d'fhógraíodh anocht agus táim sásta go bhfuil an Rialtas ag éisteacht linn ach is dócha nach bhfuil sé ag éisteacht linn i gceart.

Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil go leor daoine ann atá díreach taobh amuigh den bhanda agus nach mbeidh in ann cabhair agus cúnamh i gcomhair Mheán Fómhair. Ní bhfaighidh daoine ar €620 in aghaidh na seachtaine a bhfuil páiste amháin acu tada. Leis an méid atá á chur os comhair na Dála againn anocht, bheadh 500,000 páiste eile ag fáil cabhrach. Ciallaíonn sé sin go mbeidh 75% de pháistí scoile ag fáil cúnaimh agus ag fáil cabhrach. Is é sin an cineál aicsin atá ag teastáil uainn ón Rialtas seo. Teastaíonn uainn go dtuigfeadh an Rialtas go dteastaíonn an chabhair sin. Is mór an trua é nár éist an Rialtas linn i gceart. I am delighted that we are having this debate. I am pleased that there has been an announcement tonight. After weeks and months of hearing that no action would be taken until the budget, it is welcome that some action has been taken. It is clear that the Government listened to the proposals put forward by my colleague, Deputy Ó Laoghaire, but the problem is that it did not listen to them fully and that a whole section of people are left behind. Our proposals would mean 500,000 extra children being included. That would mean that 75% of schoolgoing children would get that support. That is the kind of action that is needed from Government and the kind of support that Galway families need now. I ask the Minister to reflect on that and to bring in the measures Sinn Féin is proposing this evening.	spk_169

Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-06-28	dail	33	Emergency Budget: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_18	Forty years ago we were experiencing double-digit inflation and the Taoiseach of the time addressed the nation and said we were living beyond our means and needed to tighten our belts. Those words are not far from the words of this Government, as it tells people they must wait. They must just wait another few months before the Government can help any more, but the people cannot wait. The belt cannot be tightened any further by the worker in the west who is struggling to make the trip to his badly needed job because he cannot pay the cost of going there five days a week, or the young couple who were spending most of their wages on rent even before this crisis and now wonder how in the name of God they will ever get married or have children. Then there is the elderly woman who stays in one room all day long so she only has to heat it and goes to bed earlier so she can save on oil. The reality is there are no other options left for these people. They have done all they can. We cannot be some ivory tower that pays lip service to the struggles and needs of the people but fails to act. Every single one of us in this Chamber holds clinics. We know the stark realities people are facing and we need to do everything we can to help. Insím leis an Aire Stáit gur léir go bhfuil brú aisteach ar theaghlaigh faoi láthair. Tá orthu rogha a dhéanamh idir a gcuid billí a íoc nó bia a cheannach. Ní thuigim, a bheag nó a mhór, an fáth a bhfuil an Rialtas ag rá le daoine fanacht roinnt míonna eile go dtí gur féidir leis an Rialtas cabhrú leo. Week after week, I have heard the Taoiseach raise Putin's war on Ukraine when questioned about the cost of living crisis. I and others beside me understand the war is fuelling the inflation crisis. We get that. We get that there are external factors that are way beyond the control of this Government, but the Minister of State needs to understand that when families literally cannot put food on their tables, we need to do something. We understand the Government cannot control the price of commodities. We understand it cannot control what happens in a war zone. However, it can control what happens here. It can change the rate of excise duty. It can increase cost-of-living payments. It can put a month's rent back into renters' pockets. This Dáil and this Government are not some everyday onlooker. Deputy Fleming is a Minister of State. He and his Government have power. They can act on what we have put forward in this motion and we need them to act on this. We keep hearing from this Government that it cannot do everything. We are not asking it to do everything but we are asking it to put forward the suggestions we have in the motion this evening. They are easily implemented measures that would help those who need it most. We have often heard, and often heard it from this Government, that politics is about choices. The Government is choosing to close its eyes to these measures. This should not be about party politics. This should be about doing what is best for the people. We have decent measures here so we should work together and implement them. I do not need to tell the Minister of State what he already knows, namely, that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Central Bank have all said the Government has scope to introduce additional measures to support households. Indeed, IFAC and the OECD have said the Government's measures have not been targeted. The Government calls us populist all the time. Would the Minister of State call those bodies populist too? If it is populist to point out that public finances have ample fiscal space for these measures then I guess the ESRI, the Central Bank and IFAC are populists. If it is populist to point out the weakest in our society are the ones who are suffering most, then almost every community group and NGO in this State are populists. If it is populist to want to protect people from this crisis and govern in a responsible way, then I guess every party not in government is populist. What the Government calls populist, therefore, is what I call living in the real world.	spk_260

He is on the record on several occasions saying that he does not see what purpose is served by the ongoing pursuit of Mr. Assange and, most importantly, that enough is enough. On Friday, in response to the British Home Secretary's decision to approve Mr. Assange's extradition, Australia’s Foreign Minister also echoed Prime Minister Albanese's words. Earlier that day, French MP, Mr. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, spoke out and said that if he had become Prime Minister, Mr. Assange would have been made a naturalised French citizen and requested he be sent to France. Julian Assange's extradition would be a major blow to press freedom, freedom of speech and western liberal values. This man suffered appalling treatment for three years in Belmarsh prison, which the UN described as torture. Before that, he was confined to the Ecuadorian embassy because he correctly believed the US was trying to seize him. Not only was it planning this, it has been alleged that it had also considered assassinating him. Earlier this month, the Spanish National High Court summoned President Trump's former Secretary of State to explain the alleged assassination plot. It is time this man was set free and allowed to live in peace. President Biden said something very important on World Press Freedom Day. He sated that we must ""hold to account those that seek to silence voices essential to transparent, trustworthy, and responsive governance."" Nobody has done more to promote these values than Julian Assange. He revealed major war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq. His organisation, WikiLeaks, published more than 90,000 US military documents relating to the Afghan war and almost 350,000 relating to the Iraq war.

Tuigim go bhfuil an rún níos leithne ná sin ach mar atá ráite ag mo chuid comhghleacaithe, caithfimid a thuiscint gurb é an bealach is fearr le déileáil leis an gcostas seo agus leis an ardú sa chostas seo go fadtéarmach ná infheistíocht cuí a dhéanamh i bhfoinsí inathnuaite. Sin an rud a chaithfear a dhéanamh go fadtéarmach agus tuigimid freisin nach raibh dóthain déanta ag rialtas i ndiaidh rialtais le 20 bliain anuas chun infheistíocht cuí a dhéanamh i gcúrsaí inathnuaite. Chomh maith leis sin, tá a fhios againn go bhfuil géarchéim ann mar gheall ar an gcostas atá ar bhreosla ach go háirithe. Tuigim go bhfuil ionaid sonraí sa Stát seo a úsáideann an oiread céanna leictreachais is a úsáideann ceantair tuaithe na tíre seo. Beidh ardú air sin go 30% d'úsáid leictreachais ar fad faoi 2030. Mar gheall go bhfuil an deis agam labhairt leis an Aire Stáit faoi seo anois, ba mhaith liom plé a dhéanamh ar an gcostas sin agus ar an mbrú atá á chur ar theaghlaigh agus ar theaghlaigh tuaithe ach go háirithe mar gheall ar an ardú ar an gcostas ar bhreosla.Chonaiceamar le gairid go bhfuil ardú 11% tagtha ar phraghas peitril agus díosail le coicís anuas. Mar is eol don Aire Stáit, níl an córas iompair poiblí céanna ag ceantair tuaithe is atá ag ceantair chathracha. Chomh maith leis sin, tá a fhios againn i gceantair cosúil le Conamara nach bhfuil na foinsí leictreachais sin ann i gcomhair carranna leictreachais ach an oiread. Tá daoine ag brath ar a gcuid carranna chun dul chuig an obair, chuig an siopa, chun an ospidéil, nó pé rud eile. Tá a fhios agam freisin go bhfuil ardú praghais ann ag an bpointe seo agus go bhfuil sé €650 níos daoire anois ná ag an am seo anuraidh do dhaoine atá ag tiomáint carranna peitril. Dóibh siúd a bhfuil carranna díosail acu, tá ardú €640 i gceist ón mbliain anuraidh.

It is very welcome we are having this discussion because we all know the benefit of these grants. I have to say in particular that I often come across the big difference the housing aid for older people grant makes in people's lives. In many cases it involves small simple things that need to be done but they make a massive difference to those people who are getting older. They need small little jobs done to be able to access their homes better. We know it is getting more difficult to get contractors to take on these very small jobs. This is one issue I have come across quite regularly in my clinics. Another issue, as has been said already, is with regard to the many requests being made but no availability in certain councils, such as Galway County Council, to do them. Tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuil seo á phlé againn mar tuigimid cé chomh tábhachtach is atá na deontais seo. Tá brú aisteach ar chomhairlí áirithe agus tá a fhios agam go bhfuil brú ollmhór ar Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe, i mo Dháilcheantar, mar gheall ar na deontais a rinne sí leis seo agus tá brú uirthi mar gheall nach bhfuil dóthain airgid aici ar aon chuma. Tuigimid cé chomh tábhachtach is a bhfuil na deontais seo do na hathruithe beaga go bhféadfaí a dhéanamh i dtithe. Go háirithe táim ag smaoineamh ar na daoine atá níos sine. Ní theastaíonn uathu ach athrú beag bídeach agus déanann sin difríocht ollmhór. Tá sé go maith go bhfuil seo á phlé inniu ach caithimid a chinntiú go bhfuil na hacmhainní ar fad ag na comhairlí contae chun dul i ngleic leis seo.	spk_27
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-05-31	dail	33	Food Price Rises: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_14	We know that the cost of living is rising. We know the severe pressure that people are under to heat their homes as well as to put fuel in their cars in order to get to work and do the bare minimum that most people need to do. However, we are facing a new part of the cost of living crisis, that being, food poverty. People are finding it increasingly difficult to put food on the table. More than 60% of people say that they are now making choices in terms of food. This is a crisis point. No spin can be put on this. It is a crisis when people cannot pay for food to put on their tables or when they have to make a choice about whether they will put food on their tables, fill their cars, heat their homes or meet life’s basic necessities. One would imagine that the Government would say that it needed to take action quickly and that it would do everything it could to help the most vulnerable in society. Every Deputy has been approached by constituents who are suffering greatly because of the major increase in the cost of living. We in Sinn Féin ran a survey on the cost of living crisis. Of those who had come to us saying that they were struggling with food, one pensioner replied that it was not possible to live on what was left after paying the electricity bill by card at An Post. The pensioner could not afford groceries, was eating the bare minimum and said that life was very hard. This is the reality for people. A woman in her 40s said that there was a major difference – approximately €30 of an increase – in her weekly shopping compared with a year ago. People do not have €30 at their disposal. This is something that makes a difference in the kind of food, and how much of it, they can put on their tables. In our motion, Sinn Féin is making constructive proposals to help people who are struggling and those who are the most vulnerable. We have consistently made constructive and credible proposals on how to tackle the cost of living crisis. We in this Chamber must be united on the crisis because that is what people need us to do. A cost of living cash payment of €200 for every adult with an income of less than €30,000 must be introduced, as must a payment of €100 for every adult with an income of between €30,000 and €60,000. We have also made a range of other proposals. This issue cannot be allowed to fall on deaf ears anymore. Immediate action is necessary to tackle the cost of living crisis so that people can eat when they need to.	spk_183

Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-05-25	dail	33	Strike Action by the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí as an deis an rún fíorthábhachtach seo a chur os comhair na Dála. Déileálann sé le rud an-mhífhéaráilte atá ag dul ar aghaidh le blianta fada. I thank the Deputies on my right for bringing forward this very important motion. I also welcome the medical scientists who are here today and who are witnessing this discussion. I commend them on their strength and on standing up for what is right. I hope the Minister and his Government will also stand up for what is right. As the Minister will know, the MLSA represents 2,100 medical scientists. Something the Taoiseach said struck me yesterday during Leaders' Questions, so I will give a little background to this. Prior to this industrial action, the MLSA had just one official strike in its 61 years of existence. That was back in 1968, a year of great global upheaval. There was the Prague Spring, student protests all over the world and so on. The limited action the MLSA took that year was therefore hardly out of step with mainstream current events. The Government of the day was a Fianna Fáil one with Jack Lynch as Taoiseach, and a fair deal was reached with the union. I hope we will see a fair deal and a recognition of these workers again now. I wish to comment on something the Taoiseach said yesterday, which was that the medical scientists should engage in the process. It is very clear the medical scientists have always been willing to engage in every single process and that they have been extremely patient and conciliatory, but they have been left with no other option. It is now more than two decades since the report of the expert group on medical laboratory technician and technologist grades. As part of that, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health agreed to recommend pay parity between biochemists and medical scientists, but that was undone only months after it seemingly being resolved. The first public service benchmarking process ended up tying those grades to different markers, so there has been ample time to sort this and it is extremely unfair. As others have mentioned, medical scientists find themselves working in medical laboratories alongside clinical biochemists and medical laboratory aides, yet such a significant pay differential exists despite them conducting similar work. It is an incredible source of frustration to them, as it should be, that they are not getting that same wage or a higher one. I could ask the Minister how that is fair. It is completely unfair. I wonder how it was ever allowed to come to pass. Medical scientists essentially perform the same function as clinical biochemists but have completely different pay scales and are paid on average 8% less for the work they do. They also have fewer career development opportunities and less support for education and training. We know that workers are facing burnout. One thing that has been quite interesting in the media coverage over recent days - it is found whenever there is strike action - is that everybody suddenly has come out and said we cannot do anything if we do not have these workers. That is why those workers are there. They perform an extremely important function. Those of us who, unlike an Teachta O'Rourke, did not come from this background might not know all the intricacies of the work they have been doing. It is, however, very clear from the media coverage we have heard over recent days that people from various hospitals have come out and talked about the extremely important work being done. They have been, as I said, extremely patient but they need to be listened to at this point.It is incredibly frustrating. They have met with the Department of Health but the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has not engaged. As my colleague Deputy O'Reilly said, you need to make sure that the finances are there. There has to be action from the Government here and now. We know the extremely important work being done by the medical scientists. We need to ensure the money is there to make sure they get fair pay and equity. I urge the Minister to speak to his Cabinet colleagues and put the pressure on the Government to make sure there is fairness here. We know the incredible work that has been done. We all stood up and clapped for front-line workers during the pandemic. Now we need to follow that up with action.	spk_29
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-05-25	dail	33	Recent Developments in Northern Ireland: Statements	dbsect_12	The British Government's so-called Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill has been nicknamed the Bill of shame by victims and survivors of the conflict. That is absolutely no surprise. In 2014, the British Government was a co-signatory, with the five main parties in the North, to the Stormont House Agreement. That agreement was the first sign that there would be a human rights-based, legally compliant approach to the outstanding matter of victims' rights following our conflict. The Good Friday Agreement made only cursory mention of victims and survivors, but it did mention that it was important to address the suffering of victims and survivors and it acknowledged that justice was essential for peace. After that, we witnessed piecemeal, if important, approaches to addressing the experiences of some victims. It was not enough. The proposals of the Consultative Group on the Past, a body appointed by the British Government, included, among a wide range of recommendations, human rights-compliant investigations. The British Government rejected the proposals of the body it had appointed. Victims then saw the proposals from the Haass-O'Sullivan process disregarded by unionism. In 2014, with all the vested interests at the table, there was progress at last. The stalling and bad faith by the British Government since that date have been a source of incredible disappointment and frustration for families, with many family members, sadly, passing away in the meantime. It is worth noting that in parallel with this bad faith, the British Government, when reporting to the United Nations and the Council of Europe, has relied on its commitment to the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement as its vehicle for remedy of outstanding and serious human rights violations. Last year's command paper on dealing with the legacy of the past indicated that this bad faith was now out in the open. The British Government was willing unilaterally to abandon its intergovernmental approach on the Stormont House Agreement and, by extension, the Good Friday Agreement. In doing so, it was willing to abandon its legal and moral obligations to victims and survivors. Yesterday, the Conservative Party passed Second Stage of the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill, notwithstanding that every single political party on this island, North and South, clearly opposed its contents, and with disregard to every single victims and survivors group. It has done so despite all legal and independent advice that the Bill is anti-law and anti-human rights. We in the Dáil must acknowledge that while the British Government might try to enter rogue state territory with its approach, victims and survivors - Irish citizens - retain their human rights. We must strive to ensure those rights are upheld. If the mothers of children killed with impunity can stand in dignity and with resolve, like Marian Walsh, the mother of 17-year-old Damien, who was killed at his work in 1993, did yesterday, with complete determination, outside the Northern Ireland Office's shiny new building in Belfast, then we must stand with them. If Alana McShane, the sister of 17-year-old Gavin, who was killed while going to school in 1994, only weeks before the ceasefire, could leave her mother Maria's month's mind yesterday to travel to Downing Street to hand in a letter to Boris Johnson, then we can amplify her voice. The British Government thinks it can do whatever it wants to citizens in this country. It thinks it can be responsible for killings, collusion in killings, cover-up of its nefarious practices and perpetuating impunity, and then pretend to be neutral. It thinks it can introduce an amnesty for all actors to the conflict with a veil of truth exchange that is of no value and that debases the very concept of truth. It thinks hurt, pain and trauma can be swept aside. The British Government does not care for these victims at all and it does not know them. It does not know their courage, determination or, indeed, their resolve. These families are saying they will never give in. We all, to a person, must join them.	spk_179
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-05-24	dail	33	Journalists in Conflicts across the World: Statements	dbsect_5	George Orwell famously said that in times of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act. I was reminded of this when I saw the cold-blooded murder of Shireen Abu Akleh. The European Union said in a statement that it strongly condemns the killing, occurring as it did just days after world press freedom day. This was an absolute travesty. It reminds me of another ongoing travesty, which is Julian Assange's continued imprisonment in Belmarsh prison. The UN special rapporteur on torture described his treatment as prolonged exposure to psychological torture, including extreme stress, chronic anxiety and intense psychological trauma. Shireen and Julian were two revolutionary truth tellers who spoke truth to power. Those in positions of power, whether the Israeli forces or their US counterparts, cannot allow this to continue. From all sides of the House I have rightly heard criticism of the murder of Shireen Abu Akleh. We are united in our horror at Israel's actions. We must now be united in our holding of apartheid Israel to account for its actions. Israel is ignoring our cries and it is now on us to do everything in our power to mount international pressure on Israel so it can no longer ignore international condemnation. The late great war correspondent Robert Fisk once said the job of journalists is to be witnesses to history, not to worry about themselves and to try to get as near as possible in an imperfect world to the truth and get the truth out. We must stand with them.	spk_103

I am equally shocked nothing has been done for renters since. We have a completely crazy situation in Galway city where there are in excess of 1,500 Airbnb properties to rent but only 44 places or properties to rent long-term. That is greatly impacting people. We also have a situation where the average rent is in excess of €1,500. A quick visit to an Airbnb website to tot up a month's rent for such a property will show it will cost more than €2,500 for a single room and in excess of €5,000 for an apartment. This shows the completely crazy situation in respect of Airbnb properties in Galway city. The Minister of State is as aware as I am that notices to quit are through the roof in Galway at the moment. The Government inaction on this issue is having an impact on and messing with real people's lives. I had a clinic yesterday and the Minister of State will know well that constituent after constituent who came into me raised the issue of housing. There are young families in bed and breakfast accommodation that is completely substandard, where black mould is growing and the mattresses are completely dirty. This situation exists but the appropriate laws are not being enforced. I hope the Minister of State will listen tonight to constructive criticism from the Opposition to ensure that this law is passed.	spk_142

Chomh maith leis sin, tá go leor den fhostaíocht ag brath ar chúrsaí turasóireachta, rud nach raibh mórán de ann i rith 2020. Is rud eile a bhféadfaí a chur san áireamh ná go bhfuil sé i bhfad níos deacra an t-airgead a fháil ar iasacht chomh maith. Ní hamháin go gcaithfí an t-airgead a bheith á mheaitseáil ach, chomh maith leis sin caithfear a chinntiú go bhfuil an t-airgead ann roimh réidh agus ansin faightear an t-airgead ar ais. Tá deacrachtaí ar leith mar gheall air sin sna hoileáin.  Aithnítear na deacrachtaí seo nuair a bhreathnaítear ar dheontais an Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, áit a thugtar níos mó airgid do mhuintir na n-oileán. De bharr go n-aithníonn an Rialtas é seo, impím ar an Aire Stáit anseo agus ar an Rialtas breathnú air seo agus déileáil leis nuair atá athbhreithniú ag tarlú.	spk_12

It is equally obvious why another apartheid regime, Israel, last week murdered the brilliant Al Jazeera journalist, Shireen Abu Akleh, as she helped to document in detail the atrocities carried out by that regime. Her protective flak jacket was marked with the word ""Press"" and she was standing with other journalists but she was murdered in cold blood.

A chapter of its report was called “Protecting the State's property interest” and identified several alarming details. These included the existence of ""a fixed charge over the entire St. Vincent's Hospital site"" and ""a floating charge over all of the undertaking, property and assets of SVHG both present and future"". The Comptroller and Auditor General’s worrying conclusion was that the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group had ""pledged publicly-funded assets in return for bank finance for the development of its private hospital"". In other words, the land on which we are going to build this hospital has been used as collateral for other transactions. It was used as collateral to raise debt and for the development of St. Vincent's private hospital and commercial car park. As a result Bank of Ireland now holds a charge on this land. Therefore, not only is the Government proposing to build our new national maternity hospital on land that we do not even own but the group which owns the land has a charge on it held by Bank of Ireland, which is a potential risk to the State. The Day report of 2018 recommended that when the State is paying for a hospital, it should own it outright. That is the best outcome and way to safeguard state investment, option agreements notwithstanding. Two members of the HSE board also expressed concern about governance if the State does not own it outright. Thomas Hubert reported in "	spk_319
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-05-12	dail	33	National Maternity Hospital: Statements	dbsect_29	"This State and the religious orders have a shameful track record in their treatment of women and children. It is written into our Constitution, the foundational document of the State, that a woman's place is in the home. Until 1957, a married women became the legal property of her husband. Until the 1970s, a marriage bar forced women to resign from work upon getting married. Marital rape was not made a criminal offence until 1990. We have all heard the apologies from previous Governments over the years. Only a year ago, the Taoiseach apologised in this House. On that occasion, he apologised for the institutional abuse suffered in mother and baby homes. As the Taoiseach said, ""The State failed you"", and we need to recognise a profound failure of empathy, understanding and basic humanity over a very lengthy period. We need to have that empathy and understanding at the core. Two years before that apology, the Tánaiste also stood in this House and apologised on behalf of the State.That time it was to people who were sexually abused in day schools and for the delay afterwards and acknowledging its responsibility to protect them. In that very same year, he gave another State apology. That time it was for the CervicalCheck screening programme. He said ""we vow to make sure that it never happens to anyone else ever again”.  Before that the Tánaiste’s predecessor, former Deputy Enda Kenny, also stood up in the Dáil and he issued a State apology. He issued a State apology for the Church-run Magdalen laundries. No sooner had he issued this apology, than the HSE had to issue its own apology to Praveen Halappanavar, the husband of the late Savita Halappanavar, who died needlessly in my local hospital, Galway University Hospital. She died because religious ethos took primacy over that poor woman's right to life. Galwegians like myself and all those who marched for women's rights to choose remember the pictures of Savita which were present at every single march; her smiling face watching down over us, driving us to ensure that it would be a case of “never again”. We have heard the apologies. We have heard the “never again” and the “lessons have been learned” lines yet here we are. I am not going to rehash the legal arguments around the leasing arrangement with St. Vincent holding company or the separation of religious orders from their stakeholders. Many legal experts and people far more qualified to speak about this than me have raised serious concerns. I think these concerns compounded by the appalling track record of the treatment of women in this State lead me to fear that we will at some point hear more apologies in this House. I will conclude by telling a story about a good friend of mine. She is living proof of what happens when a religious order does have a share in the hospital. In 2018, she was allowed sign for a hysterectomy when her life was in immediate danger. Thankfully her surgeon was skilled enough to remove an ovary, tube and growth without the clinical necessity of a hysterectomy. A year later, it became clear that she required a radical hysterectomy to have any quality of life. Her condition was life limiting but not life threatening. While a hysterectomy was clinically appropriate it was not deemed necessary and hence permissible. As a result, other treatments were prescribed: months-long cocktails of Pethidine injections, morphine patches, Oxycodone and Fentanyl were prescribed destroying her quality of life. Because she was 26 and had no living children, the hospital's religious ethos deemed a surgery that would improve and eventually save her life to be inappropriate. In fact, she later discovered that her medical team could not mention the possible need of a hysterectomy with her at that point due to that ethos. That was despite her uterus slowly perforating. Eventually she had to travel to England for this operation. Another Irish woman forced to cross the sea to seek the medical services denied to her in her own State. We must have, as so many women have said in the past weeks, months and years, a public hospital on public land to ensure that women get the healthcare that they need and that they have full confidence within it. We can see from the last number of weeks how important that is to women. I only had five minutes and I have used all of my time. Maybe in his own summing up, the Minister will address some of the concerns that were raised."	spk_411
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-05-10	dail	33	Affordable Housing: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_15	People my age, when they look to the future, feel they have no chance of ever achieving homeownership. As my colleagues have said, this is happening under the Government's watch. The common theme among my friends and co-workers I have had in the past is that they work day in and day out and nothing gets easier. They feel they are completely locked out of homeownership. We are seeing now that the increase in the cost of living is squeezing people more and more in terms of their ability to rent or buy a home. At this time of the evening, people my age are going home after a long, hard day's work, commuting long distances after what probably was a tough working day. What are they going home to? They are going home to overcrowded, cramped living situations or to their parents' box room. They are trying to scrimp and save as much as they can in order to be able, at some point, to own their own home. What is the Minister saying to people like that in Galway city and county? He is saying he will deliver 30 affordable homes in the city each year and 45 in the county. That is nothing for the people who are waiting for a home and who have been trying, year in and year out, to save the money to be able to get a mortgage. It does nothing for them. Something I have seen time after time from the Government parties and their spokespeople and elected representatives in Galway is that they tell us a brilliant development is coming on board to deliver affordable housing in Galway city. Week after week, people there contact me to ask when that provision will be delivered in order that they can have a chance to own their own home. Only this week, I found out that the promised housing will not be available until 2024. That is two years away. For people who cannot afford their rent and those who have had to move back in with their parents or grandparents, this is simply not good enough. We know what is needed. We know there must be more supply. However, when we do see supply coming onboard in Galway, what we see is build-to-rent provision that is completely unaffordable for people who are working day in and day out. We need 4,000 homes a year to be delivered, as my colleague, Deputy Ó Broin, said, and we need them at affordable prices.	spk_236

Nevertheless, before this increase in inflation and the war in Ukraine, we had the highest rents in Europe. People were struggling with housing, with paying rent and even with finding accommodation. All of this was known before the increase in inflation and the uncertainty arising from the war in Ukraine. What we needed to see from the Government was clear, swift action in respect of housing. My colleague, Deputy Ó Broin, and our party have brought forward proposals time and again, and time and again what we see from the Government is a lack of action. I have read the Government's amendment to the motion but people who cannot make ends meet and who cannot pay for the rents in Galway city or county, which have increased by 8.8% and 19%, respectively, do not need flowery language from the Minister or the Government. What they need is action to tackle the cost of these rents. They need a ban on rent increases and the tax break we have put forward budget after budget. Time and again, we hear the Government saying it knows there is a cost of living crisis and that people are finding it really difficult to make ends meet but that it cannot do everything. Nobody is saying the Government can do everything but we are here to work with it constructively. We are putting forward proposals we know will assist and help people who cannot pay their rent and who are looking at a notice to quit - there has been an increase in the number of notices of quit - and are wondering what they will do now because they cannot find a place to live in Galway city or county. What they are seeing from the Government is that instead of it working productively with the Opposition, it is ignoring the suggestions of the Opposition and just offering flowery language.	spk_313

This legislation is an example of Members of the House working really well together. I feel there was a constructive process at each Stage to address an issue that is important to a wide range of people regarding how society functions for them. My colleague Teachta Buckley and I tried to work as constructively as possible with the Government side. Any member of the finance committee would surely attest that we all worked very constructively together during pre-legislative scrutiny and again on Committee Stage. Our concern, which, to be fair, probably arose for everyone in seeking to transpose the directive, related to how we could improve the functioning of our whistleblowing arrangements for those who have the courage to make a protected disclosure. Hardly a day goes by when we do not hear some horror story about actions revealed by some really courageous person. Being able to reveal them is fundamental. When discussing the Bill on every Stage, we were aware of how whistleblowers are treated in this country. Unfortunately, really damning evidence has emerged of things that have happened. During Committee Stage, we heard about people who felt their lives were destroyed when acting in the public interest. We know those people acted in the public interest; they did not do it for personal gain. They did it to make society better for as many people as possible. They were not seeking financial gain, as we know, or any kind of celebrity status. They really did what they did because they wanted to reveal wrongdoing. Unfortunately, this has often meant financial ruin and the devastation of one's physical and mental health. I said in the Chamber before that I credit the Minister for the measures in his Bill that will help to improve circumstances for those making protected disclosures. I have acknowledged those areas where the amended Bill is in line with recommendations made by me and others. I am happy to say I believe the legislation is good, or that it definitely has good aspects. I have concerns, however, and that is why I had tabled my amendments. They related, in particular, to the stepped procedure. This could be even seen as a retrograde step, as some experts feel. Transparency International Ireland spells out how it believes the procedure could violate the non-regression clause of the EU directive. There is concern that the new stepped procedure will place another barrier in the way of public-service whistleblowers. The restrictive criteria for going straight to the relevant Minister mean there could be a lowering of the standards by comparison with what is provided for in the existing Act. Since this Bill is so positive, we need to ensure everything we do assists in making arrangements better for people. There is concern that the stepped procedure will weaken them. In general, the Bill is quite good. We will have another chance to talk about it. The best thing about it is that we have all been happy about it and able to work together. There were amendments ruled out of order. Owing to the nature of the Bill, some of the measures I would have liked to include would have imposed a cost on the Exchequer, so there are issues in that regard. On the whole, however, it is good to see us all working together. I really do feel it is a good Bill in general. Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire.	spk_302

We all expressed our solidarity and support for Ukraine and its people as they suffer during this brutal war. We need to do all we can, even as a militarily neutral country. That starts by looking at domestic policy and legislation. We know that the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, has become a major offshore financial centre for the Russian economy and I have been raising this issue since 2020. Most people are now aware of it as an issue. The Central Bank recently confirmed that almost half the Russian connected vehicles in the IFSC are linked to sanctioned individuals and companies. We know that the IFSC was previously used for sanction avoidance.  I will raise the so-called golden visa and golden passport schemes, which allow elite foreign investors to buy residency and citizenship. Back in 2020, the EU Commission issued letters of formal notice to Cyprus and Malta regarding their golden passport schemes. Both countries are major havens for laundering Russian money. In March, the EU Commissioner for Justice noted that the phasing out of citizenship by investment schemes ""is fully in line with the Commission's priorities"".  I note that the Government has now frozen applications for these visas and passports for Russian investors. I note the same has been done in the UK. The Home Secretary, Priti Patel, said that was being done to stop ""corrupt elites who threaten our national security and push dirty money around our cities"". Given these concerns and the historical role the IFSC has played, it is high time for an audit because there are serious security risks and, potentially, fraudulent behaviour involved."	spk_233

According to  What many people see when they walk through Galway city and towns in the county is vacant and derelict sites and they ask why we do not know how many are actually sitting idle. The reality is that it helps to maintain an artificial scarcity of supply that keeps prices and rents high. If the Minister really wants to solve the housing crisis, he needs to come to terms with vacancy and dereliction. We all know that the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly way to improve housing supply is to start with vacant and derelict properties. My constituents in Galway are constantly asking me about properties that are sitting idle. They cannot understand why, after more than a decade of a housing crisis, there are still people without homes and homes without people.	spk_272

Bhí a fhios againne i Sinn Féin go mbeadh an ráta boilscithe ag ardú le hathoscailt an tsochaí, ach is léir nach raibh an fios céanna ag an Rialtas nuair a cheangail sé praghas cíosa leis an ráta boilscithe. Tá sé tar éis éirí níos measa mar gheall ar an gcogadh san Úcráin, ach caithfimid a bheith ionraic faoi seo. Bhí géarchéim sa chostas maireachtála roimhe seo ar fad. Bhí na cíosanna is airde san Eoraip againn, agus bhí costas cúram leanaí cosúil le praghas morgáiste. Léiríonn taighde ó Social Justice Ireland go bhfuil beagnach cúigiú de dhaoine fásta ag cónaí i mbochtanas nuair a chomhairtear an méid airgid atá á chaitheamh acu ar chíos. Anois tá rudaí ina bpraiseach iomlán. Teastaíonn cabhair ó dhaoine. Caithfear gearradh siar ar an dleacht mháil ar ola bhaile, pheitreal agus díosal, agus caithfear níos mó daoine a tharraingt isteach sa liúntas breosla. Teastaíonn ciste lánroghnach chun cabhair a thabhairt dóibh siúd atá faoi bhrú uafásach agus nach bhfuil in ann íoc as a gcuid billí. Sin an cineál gníomh atá ag teastáil ó dhaoine ón Rialtas. Sadly, the cost of living crisis hit us long before the war in Ukraine. We already had unaffordable rents as well as childcare that cost as much as a second mortgage and we were the fourth most expensive EU country where electricity was concerned. Before Christmas, Social Justice Ireland told us that almost one fifth of adults were living in poverty when housing costs were included. That was the crisis point before the war, and it has now become unmanageable for many people to keep the lights on, keep the house warm and put food on the table. People need targeted supports right now to help them through this difficult time. It is high time that the fuel allowance was extended to those in receipt of the working family payment. We need a discretionary fund so that those people who do not get the fuel allowance and who are in crisis can avail of it. Unfortunately, we are living in extraordinary times. We need a response from the Government that reflects that.	spk_146

I have been contacted by many people in my own constituency. They are finding it extremely difficult to find a dental practice that is taking part in the scheme. I contacted the HSE for a list of dentists who are participating in this scheme in County Galway. I received a list of 24 in total. However, after contacting each of these practices, I understand that only 14 of those are participating in the scheme and only ten are taking on new patients through this scheme. Can the Minister tell us how often this information is being collected? What is the Department of Health doing to ensure the information is being updated to reflect the reality? Without that information, it is proving even more difficult for people to access the dental care that they need.	spk_274
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-03-10	dail	33	Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_40	All of us will be aware from our work in our constituencies and from our clinics that the most vulnerable in our society often rely on moneylenders. As a result, they lose large amounts and pay large sums attempting to repay these loans. We have all heard horror stories of people stuck in that cycle. It is welcome that we are here today to try to make some effort on this. However, the Bill is a poor cousin of my colleague, Deputy Doherty's, Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2018. It is something that the Deputy has campaigned on for some time. He has really shone a light on the matter. It is unfortunate that this Bill is weaker, watered-down version of his Bill because the situation is at crisis point. The rising cost of living, including fuel, is severely impacting on ordinary working people who will increasingly be pushed into borrowing money in an attempt to put food on the table and keep the lights on. As Deputy Doherty outlined, the differences in the two Bills are clear. We have to understand that those who use moneylenders are the poorest and most vulnerable in society. Much of the time they are locked out of the normal banking system and pushed towards moneylenders as a consequence. They can end up clocking up vast amounts in interest. That is why Sinn Féin introduced its own Bill, which would have limited interest rates to three times the market average, much less than that in the Government Bill. This is unfortunate. When we do not deal with these issues head on and in the best way possible it means the most vulnerable will go further into debt. They will incur higher fees and default rates will increase leading to more misery for our constituents.  It is a missed opportunity. Sometimes it feels as though this Government never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity. The change to how moneylenders operate in this State should have been made years ago. It should have happened when Deputy Doherty and Sinn Féin introduced his Bill. We cannot have a situation of dither, dally and delay; we need action. It is good to have some action but just doing the bare minimum means that it will not have a massive impact on those people who continue to have to rely on moneylenders and even more so with the increased inflation rates, including for fuel and rent. It is unfortunate that this was not adopted in 2018 when my colleague introduced his Bill because we would have come a long way since then.	spk_285
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-03-09	dail	33	Flexible and Remote Work: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_10	I commend the Labour Party on bringing this motion forward. If there is one thing that came out clearly from Covid-19, it is that workers are able to work from home and indeed that for many it gives a far better work-life balance. No sooner had the Tánaiste's right to request remote working Bill been introduced than the Tánaiste said it needed changes to be fit for purpose. I think describing it as not fit for purpose is actually too charitable. It should have been described as dead on arrival. This raises a simple question: why bother even introducing it in the first place? It kind of fooled us. It made us think that the Government was actually a supporter of remote working. Last summer, the Tánaiste wrote an op-ed in Due to the weaknesses of this Bill, there will be many more people having to get up a hell of a lot earlier in the morning to catch the bus, train or DART or to beat the traffic on the M50, N40 or M6. It has to be said that people will get home much later in the evening as well. With the evenings getting longer, people will be spending more time commuting and there will be more traffic, more pollution and much more stress. It was astonishing to see so much anger in people when the Bill came out because people thought that one thing that came out of Covid was that they could see that things could be done differently. We could see that people can actually work from home and there can be a better work-life balance. However, all of that and all of those lessons that we learned from Covid were completely and utterly ignored. Rather than seeing this as an opportunity to do things differently, that, again, was completely ignored. The Government had an opportunity and it completely missed it. As my colleague Deputy O’Reilly said, there is a difference between not opposing and supporting.	spk_43

Next week will mark Brain Awareness Week. I want to commend the work of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and the Irish Dementia Working Group, whose members are incredible advocates and activists. Covid presented a unique and distressing challenge for people living with dementia and those who care for them. The Government can and must do more in budgets, staffing and capital investment to deliver the support services and the strategy that the working group has so comprehensively set out for decision makers. The risk of dementia is five times greater for people with an intellectual disability. This heightened risk requires enhanced efforts by policymakers and clinicians to improve awareness of brain health and the importance of early diagnosis.

In short, Professor McCarron's message is that it is possible to reduce the risk of dementia, and active promotion on brain health is absolutely fundamental to this objective.

A fortnight ago I raised with the Taoiseach the issue of opaque shell companies.  These companies are used for aggressive tax planning by firms accused of money laundering which have funnelled billions of euro from the IFSC to Russia.  When I mentioned this to the Taoiseach, he mentioned securitisation but these accounts are not securitisation vehicles.  If changes to our financial regulations and tax codes are not necessary, why has the EU demanded that Ireland implement reforms on money laundering and aggressive tax planning?  The NRRP clearly states that the State must ""enhance the supervision and enforcement of the anti-money-laundering framework as regards professionals providing trust and company services."" If we want to show solidarity to the people of Ukraine, we must take real action on this.  Will the Taoiseach commit to ending the use of anonymous company ownerships through trustee structures and ending the ability of these companies to operate from the IFSC for the purpose of aggressive tax planning through section 110 of the tax code? At a minimum, will the Taoiseach ensure the Minister for Finance undertakes a cost benefit analysis of section 110 to ascertain whether it is consistent with current reforms to the international tax regime?"	spk_298

Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-03-09	dail	33	Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_22	Mar a dúradh níos luaithe, tá súil againn gurb í seo an uair dheireanach a bheidh orainn déileáil le scéimeanna cosúil leo seo mar gheall ar Covid-19. As was mentioned previously, we all are hoping that this will be the last time that we have to deal with these Covid-related measures. Hopefully, we really are seeing the back of Covid-19. This Bill will give legislative effect to the changes to certain Covid support schemes announced by the Government in December 2021 and January 2022. They were the changes announced in response to the most recent period of public health restrictions. The Bill deals with the changes to the CRSS, the EWSS, tax debt warehousing and so forth, but it also provides for the introduction of a new measure, the pandemic special recognition payment or what is more commonly known as the Covid bonus, which is what I wish to focus on. Its introduction is most certainly welcome. We all have recognised for a long time how difficult it has been for front-line healthcare workers during the pandemic. At a time people did not know much about, or have much information on, Covid-19, those workers were very much on the front line. There has been concern about the scope of who qualifies and the fact that certain sectors are not included. People feel that it is too narrow. There is ongoing uncertainty about who will meet the criteria for this award. All Members will have been contacted about this by different people in their constituencies. As to the payment itself and how it will work, the Minister outlined that the Bill provides for an exemption from income tax, USC and PRSI in respect of the recognition payment made to specified categories of front-line healthcare workers up to a maximum of €1,000 per individual. However, as I said, many who worked on the front line appear to have been left behind. Family carers have been to the forefront in this pandemic and should be included in this payment. I have spoken to many carers who are bitterly disappointed that they appear to have been forgotten. As Ms Catherine Cox of Family Carers Ireland pointed out in a letter to ...went above and beyond the call of duty to protect the most vulnerable, and this risk must be rewarded. Over the course of the past two years, family carers saw services and supports for their loved ones depleted and, in many cases, eradicated. As a direct consequence, the State saved money.Ms Cox contends that family carers save the State in excess of €20 billion every year. At present, there are 116,000 carers in receipt of the carer's support grant. Many Members will have dealt with family carers during the pandemic in the past two years and we saw how they were affected. They experienced reduced respite hours and limited access to day care centres. I dealt with people whose children were unable to attend their schools. That had an impact. As a result, it increased the workload for all family carers. It also meant great hardship for all the families affected. The carer's role is 24-7, and, in some cases, it means exactly that because the carer has to stay awake during the night to mind the child. The carers had hoped to be recognised through this recognition payment. Tá a fhios againn ar fad gur fhulaing na daoine is leochailí inár sochaí go hollmhór le linn na paindéime. Is dócha go bhfuil na daoine atá ag tabhairt aire dóibh lá i ndiaidh lae, daoine nach raibh seirbhísí acu le linn na paindéime mar gheall go raibh ar na seirbhísí sin á dúnadh síos, cineál brónach nó curtha as nach bhfuil siad chun an €1,000 seo a fháil.	spk_368

Ó dúnadh é sin, bhí go leor de mhuintir Chonamara i dteagmháil liom mar gheall nach raibh siad in ann fáil ar sheirbhísí ceadúnais chomh héasca agus a bhíodh. Bíonn siad ag rá go bhfuil orthu dul isteach sa chathair, rud a thógann uair go leith. Dúirt bean amháin liom i ríomhphost go bhfuil timpeall 50 ríomhphost seolta aici chuig an NDLS le bliain anuas ag iarraidh an dáta ar a mbeidh an t-ionad NDLS a bhí i dTeach an Stáisiún ag athoscailt. Tuigeann sí go bhfuil ionad i nGaillimh ach tá sé uair go leith ó bhaile agus ceapann sí go bhfuil sé de cheart ag muintir Chonamara an tseirbhís a bhí á cur ar fáil dóibh sa Chlochán a fháil ar ais. In our constituency, the Clifden NDLS part-time centre has remained closed since the start of the pandemic. This makes it very difficult for people in Connemara to renew their driving licences. Many of our constituents have been badly affected by this. I raised the matter in June 2021 and was told by the RSA that everyone can now renew their driving licence using the online system. That is not always the case, however. In order to avail of the online system, a PSC is required. Not everyone has that, nor is it a requirement to have one. Moreover, a PSC cannot be requested by any public or private body or person not included as a specified body in Schedule 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act. It is ridiculous that those in Connemara who are looking to get to an NDLS centre have to travel over an hour to Ballybrit to renew their driving licence. It is a major inconvenience. Although it was a part-time operation, the centre in Clifden was of massive benefit. It made it easier. We all know these administrative things can take a lot of time out of the day anyway. For those who are living in more rural, isolated areas it is essential to have a centre like the one in Clifden to make it easier for them to renew their licence rather than having to travel into the city.	spk_40

Bíodh is gurbh í an Ghaeilge an chéad teanga oifigiúil de chuid an Stáit seo is teanga mhionlaigh fós í agus táim den bharúil go bhfuil sé in am ag an Stát breathnú an athuair ar na spriocanna móra agus an fhís atá ann i leith na Gaeilge. Tá go leor cainte faoi láthair, mar shampla, maidir le traslitriú ainm phríomhchathair na hÚcráine, Kyiv, agus céard é an leagan is dílse don Úcráinis sa chaoi is gur féidir náisiún agus cultúr na hÚcráine a dhlisteanú. Is maith ann an díospóireacht sin agus tugann sé téamaí éagsúla chun cinn i dtaobh an impiriúlachais agus an gá atá ann le díchoilíniú iomlán a dhéanamh i náisiún a bhí faoi chois ag náisiún eile. I ndáiríre, shílfí gur cheart go mbeimid ag breathnú níos giorra don bhaile. Tá glacadh fós leis na logainmneacha gallda a bhaisteadh ar chathracha, bhailte agus sráidbhailte na tíre seo le teann fornirt cúpla céad bliain ó shin. Cén fáth nach leanaimid sampla mhuintir na hÚcráine san fheachtas dá cuid le Kyiv seachas Kiev, agus tosú ag caint faoi Bhaile Átha Cliath seachas Dublin, faoi Bhéal Feirste seachas Belfast, faoi Ghaillimh seachas Galway agus tuilleadh nach iad? Níl ciall na réasún le formhór na logainmneacha Béarla sin ar an gcéad dul síos.  Níor mhiste liom an deis a thapú freisin athaontú na hÉireann a phlé i gcomhthéacs na Gaeilge. Tá sé tábhachtach agus an cheist mhór seo faoi chaibidil againn na snáitheanna sin a cheanglaímid ar fad le cheile sa tír seo, Thuas is Theas, a aithint agus a cheiliúradh. Tá an Ghaeilge ar cheann de na snáitheanna sin. Tá baint ag an nGaeilge ar bhealach amháin nó eile le gach uile dhuine agus phobal de bhunadh an oileáin seo, mar aon le duine ar bith nua a chuireann faoi nó fúithi in éineacht linn. Is linn uile í.  Aithnímid, cuirim i gcás, an taighde ceannródaíoch a rinneadh le gairid ar shaighdiúirí de chuid airm na Breataine as oirthear Bhéal Feirste a throid sa Chéad Chogadh Domhanda a léirigh go raibh Gaeilge ag go leor acu. Ba iad seo Protastúnaigh as pobal ina raibh an tacaíocht is láidre don Bhreatain thar aon áit eile in Éirinn agus bhí siad sásta a rá in 1911 go raibh an Ghaeilge ar a dtoil acu. Níl aon dabht ach go dtugann Éire aontaithe deis nua dúinn tarraingt ar an oidhreacht chomónta seo atá againn in Éirinn, tógáil ar bhuntáistí an dátheangachais agus pobal a nascadh lena n-oidhreacht agus lena gcultúr. Is féidir linn an Ghaeilge a úsáid mar sheoid chultúrtha atá againn ní hamháin sa lá atá inniu ann, ach ar feadh blianta fada.  Má táimid chun athmhuintearas agus dlúthpháirtíocht a chothú, níor mór dúinn a thuiscint gur den phobal céanna muid inniu agus inné. Tá sé de sheans againn anois tír agus náisiún nua forásach a shamhlú don oileán seo a chuireann fáilte roimh an uile dhuine agus a thugann aird i gcónaí ar na nithe sin a nascann muid le chéile thar na rudaí a scarann óna chéile muid.Is ceart go mbeadh an teanga lárnach sa phróiseas sin. Rinneadh an pointe go bhfuil sé fíorthábhachtach dúinn ar fad a labhraíonn Gaeilge, má tá páistí againn agus má táimid in ann, Gaeilge a labhairt leis na páistí sin. Má smaoiníonn muid siar ar an stair atá againn, bhí gaolta againn ar fad le fada in Éirinn agus ag pointe amháin shocraigh na gaolta sin labhairt i mBéarla seachas i nGaeilge, cé nach raibh an Béarla fiú ar a dtoil acu ag an bpointe sin. Shocraigh siad an t-athrú sin a dhéanamh agus ba chóir dúinne ar fad an t-athrú sin a dhéanamh arís chun cinntiú go labhraítear Gaeilge amach anseo. Sin rud go gcaithfimid ar fad smaoineamh air.	spk_335
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-03-01	dail	33	Support for the Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity of Ukraine: Motion	dbsect_12	I welcome the motion. Our thoughts are with all those who are so terribly affected and impacted. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, rightly criticised the actions of the Putin regime as unacceptable and illegal.He stated that we need to be part of the response to that. I agree. Of course, how we respond is what matters. We are citizens of a neutral country which often punches way above its weight in international affairs. It is great to see the EU solidarity on this matter but, of course, accountability starts at home. It is about what we can do in the here and now and what changes we can effect. It is no secret that the IFSC is a major offshore financial centre for people linked to Putin. Gazprom, Rosneft and VTP in the state sector and major oligarch-controlled entities such as Alfa-Bank, EuroChem and Rusal are but a few of the companies involved. They all have special purpose vehicles located in the IFSC. They have no employees, offices or fixed assets and they pay no tax. Nevertheless, between 2005 and 2017, those shell companies funnelled €118 billion from the IFSC to Russia. Many of the companies that received those funds had been accused of serious wrongdoing. For example, Credit Bank of Moscow required a major bailout. Approximately 50% of its loans were to its management. Promsvyazbank had to be nationalised and its former owners were accused of being the ones buying their own debt. A quick look through some of the prospectuses for their bonds listed on the Irish Stock Exchange are striking. The section which lists risks includes reference to the fact that the measures implemented to prevent it from being used as a conduit for money laundering or terrorist financing may not be completely effective. We know that following the imposition of sanctions in 2016 and 2017, some IFSC-based companies managed to raise finance on behalf of companies under those sanctions, as was well covered in the media over the past four years. Yet nothing happened. I have been raising this matter with the Government since 2020. In September 2020, I raised the matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, who said it would be a matter for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to address. I heard nothing thereafter. Shortly after I raised the matter with the Minister of State, one shell company connected to the now sanctioned bank Sovcombank issued a bond for €300 million. Its prospectus, listed on the Irish Stock Exchange, mentions risks from the sanctions imposed by foreign governments, including sanctions against Russian individuals and legal entities. In March 2021, the now sanctioned bank Alfa-Bank issued a bond of €1.2 billion. It also noted risks from economic sanctions. I raised this matter with the Minister for Finance when he was before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach two months later and he told me he was not in a position to give an answer, which is understandable, but that he would write to me. He did not do so. I then wrote to him at the end of that month but I never received a reply. I am sorry, but that is not good enough. We need to be a part of the response. I welcome what is being done and what has been done. We absolutely do need to be a part of the response. However, we need to ensure the IFSC is not used for the purposes of sanction-busting. Are we going to continue to allow anonymous company ownership which uses legal trustees because these non-transparent structures create significant risks of abuse? Because of the trustee ownership, it can be difficult to see-----	spk_262

Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-03-01	dail	33	Support for the Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity of Ukraine: Motion	dbsect_12	That is fair enough. It is always good to have accuracy. Will the statutory company information in the Companies Registration Office, CRO, be made free, as it is in Companies House in Britain? Are we going to continue to allow these Russian-connected companies operate tax free because they can avail of the section 110 tax concession? Are we going to introduce any kind of accountability to that small network of professional services, including legal and accountancy firms that service them? These are the primary beneficiaries of these Russian-connected shell companies. These things have been brought to light in the context of the invasion of Ukraine. We need to consider whether a cost-benefit analysis can be done around the use of section 110 tax concessions, which allow these companies, and many others, to operate largely tax free. With the current reforms in the international tax regime, a tax concession for non-residents such as this seems completely out of step. We are more than happy to work with the Minister. Indeed, we think that is crucial and it is good to see everyone working together on this issue. However, if we want to provide a deterrent to the Putin regime and its connected oligarchs, we need to aim for their pockets and look at what has happened in the IFSC.	spk_268

A total of 8,866 people are currently on waiting lists for inpatient care in the Galway University Hospitals. As the Minister knows, there is a story behind every single one of those figures. There is a person in need and a family who are worried. Shockingly, more than 2,000 of those people have been waiting for more than 18 months for an appointment. We have all heard stories of people who are languishing on these waiting lists but it is important to highlight the human cost of these waiting lists and to show that these are not just figures but are real life experiences for thousands of people. One family contacted me during the summer. A man who had been waiting since 2019 for treatment was told it would be at least another year before he would be seen as a public patient. His condition was such that if he waited to get surgery, the disease would spread to other parts of his body and get worse. For outpatient care in Galway University Hospitals, the figures are even more shocking and staggering. More than 50,000 patients are waiting for an appointment, more than 30,000 of whom have been waiting for more than six months. Those are the figures for adults; they are even higher when children are included. We are failing our children. Tá na liostaí feithimh do na hospidéil i nGaillimh go hiomlán dochreidte.

An associated issue is that concerns have been raised about the impact dredging would have on the pearl mussel. I am sure the Minister of State will agree that if a report needs to be done, it should be done now. We cannot continue with a situation where flooding is occurring at the same level as it currently is, given the impact on members of the local community going about their daily business.	spk_393

It is unfortunate that the Government has decided to kick the can down the road for six months. I understand that there is the child maintenance review group. While it is welcome that something is being done, these people need help right now. The Government has form, in that when practical measures are being proposed by the Opposition, they often fall on deaf ears. From our clinics and speaking to our constituents, family members and neighbours, we all know how difficult many lone parents have it when going through the courts. Any practical and simple step like the one suggested by Deputy Kerrane in her Bill and as previously proposed by Fianna Fáil, and that would provide these people with assistance, should be taken as a matter of urgency. We have had many debates in the Chamber about the increase in the cost of living and we are all acutely aware of the pressures that people face. We are now discussing people who are at risk of poverty or, as in many cases, are already in poverty and we need to do everything we can to help them. The Minister of State and others have mentioned how this approach is being taken in other places, including the North. My colleague, Deputy Kerrane, has been talking about it for many years. It is not new, but it can be done in a practical and easy way. For people who are in such a difficult situation and have to go through the courts - that in itself is difficult, including in terms of the outcomes - this practical approach could work for them and make payments more accessible. Just this week, one such parent who attended my clinic said how difficult the entire process was. It can be difficult, as it is not something that people would be used to. It is unfortunate that the Bill is not being accepted this moment and is being put back for six months. I suggest that the amendment be removed at the end of those six months. It is not the first time that this proposal has been before the Dáil. It should have been enacted as soon as it was proposed. It is a simple measure to make matters easier for people. We should all be here to propose as many practical and simple solutions as possible to make life easier for people. That is what they have elected us to do. I commend my colleague Deputy Kerrane on introducing this Bill and, like Deputy Martin Kenny, I urge the Minister of State to reconsider his amendment.	spk_351

Tá praghas leictreachais tar éis ardú 22%, tá peitreal ardaithe 30%, tá díosal ardaithe 32%, tá gás ardaithe 28% agus tá ola don bhaile suas 50%. Níl ioncam na ndaoine atá orthu na praghsanna sin a íoc tar éis ardú ar chor ar bith.

Dúirt muid leis an Rialtas anuraidh gur chóir labhairt leis an gcoimisiún faoin gcáin breise luacha a laghdú mar a rinneadh i dtíortha eile san Eoraip, ach ní raibh an Rialtas fiú sásta an cheist sin a chur. An tseachtain seo caite dúirt an tAire Comhshaoil, Aeráide agus Cumarsáide sa Seomra seo gurb é an bealach go bhfuil an Rialtas ag cabhrú leo siúd atá ag fulaingt ná go bhfuil laghdú de 20% ar tháillí córas iompair poiblí, ach is léir nach bhfuil a fhios ag an Rialtas fiú nach bhfuil córas iompair poiblí ag feidhmiú i gceart sna ceantair thuaithe. Tá a fhios againn sin agus tá a fhios againn nach bhfuil busanna ar fáil dóibh siúd atá ina gcónaí i gceantair iargúlta. I nGaillimh, ghearr an Rialtas seo siar ar an tseirbhís bus fiú. Ghearr an Rialtas leis an gComhaontas Glas siar ar an tseirbhís bus ach táthar ag insint dóibh siúd atá ina gcónaí sna ceantair thuaithe gur chóir dóibh a bheith ag brath ar an tseirbhís bus sin. Ní fiú an chabhair sin ar chor ar bith. Tá na daoine sin ag brath ar an gcarr nó ar an leoraí i gcomhair na hoibre agus chuala mé ó tharlóir amháin go bhfuil an costas chun an leoraí a líonadh tar éis ardú ó €350 go €500. Tá sé sin ag teacht amach as a phóca féin. Níl sé ag fáil faic ón gcomhlacht atá sé ag obair dó. Tá brú eile air chun bia a chur ar an mbord, chun a bheith cinnte go bhfuil bia ag an teaghlach agus go bhfuil sé in ann a theach a théamh.

These shell companies pay no tax and have no employees. I raised this issue not once, not twice, but three times with the Government. I raised it in the Chamber in September 2020, I raised it with the Minister in front of the finance committee on 6 May 2021, and I wrote to the Minister for Finance on 27 May 2021 but I got no response. What has been done since I raised this issue in September 2020? Section 110 allows companies, and not just Russian companies, to use interest payments to write down their tax obligations to zero. When will this finally be phased out? It is clearly not in line with the current reforms in international tax regimes. I really want to know what has been done since I raised it in this Chamber in September 2020.	spk_305

I spoke earlier, as my colleague Deputy Brady alluded to, on the use of section 110 of the tax code in the IFSC and the funnelling of money. What I am speaking on now is broader and concerns security situations within Europe. One of the things that the EU Commission will have us believe is that halting climate change is its top priority. Of course, the impending climate catastrophe has to be stopped. However, in the summer of 2021, it decided for the first time since the founding of the Common Market to allocate funds directly from the EU budget to fund the military, and this decision is a disaster for the planet. Everyone knows the carbon footprint of war and weaponry is a major accelerator of climate change. Worse still, we are not talking about paltry sums. The sum involved is colossal at €49 billion. If the truth were told, there were plans to almost double that figure, but that was only prevented due to the cost of the Covid pandemic. What an utter waste of resources, when one thinks how these resources could be employed for the common good, including battling climate change. The amount of waste in the manufacture of armaments, from the production of the metals to the consumption of fossil fuels to the running of tanks or warplanes, is vast. War and armaments are the very antithesis of sustainability. Another sinister plan was to suck in the Irish industry and SMEs to be involved in this military-industrial sector. A report from the EU defence ministers' summit in 2020 referred to Enterprise Ireland being directly involved in bringing Irish SMEs into this work. The buzzword behind developing an EU military-industrial complex and an EU army is ""autonomy"" but what about Irish autonomy or, another word, neutrality? The Minister needs to project that positive neutrality. It was our past neutral stance that got us elected, by the small nations of the world, to the UN Security Council. I am concerned that a security and military union is scheduled to be the next stage of EU integration. As long ago as 2016, the then Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, called for an EU security union with the end goal of establishing an EU army. When the permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, was launched, Juncker tweeted, ""Permanent Structured Cooperation is happening. I welcome the operational steps taken today by Member States to lay the foundations of a European #DefenceUnion."" The European Parliament, meanwhile, called for the EU to upgrade its military to use its full potential as a world power. In December 2017, Ireland joined PESCO in the first steps of the formation of this. Membership of PESCO obliges the State to increase military spending from its current 0.3% of GDP, the lowest in the EU, to a potential 2%. We have a proud tradition of neutrality and we must reject any ties to these kinds of military alliances. The reality is we do not want to see the use of warplanes."	spk_427

Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-02-15	dail	33	Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_20	"It is important to note that this Bill came about not because of a desire necessarily to improve our existing protected disclosures regime and it was not inspired by the need to give further protections to the many whistleblowers whose concerns have been raised in this Chamber or to set a new standard in whistleblowing protection. The reason the Bill is before us today is to satisfy the transposition of the EU's whistleblowing directive and its mandatory reporting requirements. However, the crafting of the Bill gave us an opportunity to reflect on our whistleblowing regime and to understand what is working well and not working well. Over the course of the last few months, when this was discussed within the committee, it was an eye-opener for many committee members as to the different issues that so many whistleblowers and transparency campaigners face. I commend all of those who came before the committee and who told their very personal stories and told of the personal difficulties they faced as a result of their whistleblowing. As the legislation is almost ten years old, a review was timely. I take on board that the Minister has said he would welcome amendments on Committee Stage. My colleague, Deputy Buckley, and I had drafted our own Bill, which looked to raise the bar and which could be used to ensure there is no lowering of existing standards. We know that whistleblowers play a key role in society and that is very true when we look at our own history within this State. Transparency International says that whistleblowing is acknowledged as one of the most effective ways of stopping wrongdoing. For example, many of the cases of corruption and fraud that we know about have been exposed by workers who reported those issues to their employers, regulators or the press. In fact, it is believed that more cases of fraud and corruption are exposed by whistleblowers than by any other actor, including the police and the media. We saw the very difficult situations that people have faced as a result of doing that. Unfortunately, as we know, when a whistleblower does reveal wrongdoing, the primary concern of the authorities can be reputational damage to the organisation and there can be an attempt, as we have seen, to circle the wagons, cast aspersions on whistleblowers’ motivations and engage in retaliation. That means the whistleblowers themselves can suffer greatly for acting in the public interest and they pay a very high price for speaking out, both financially and in terms of their health. That is why we felt there was a need to remove the cap on awards. We saw the evidence in the committee that people are ostracised as a result of speaking out in the public interest and research shows that people lose over €40,000 in the course of their working life as a result. We felt it should be changed to “fair and equitable” but, as the Minister said, we will discuss that on Committee Stage, when we can go into this further. This is something we need to look at because it can help set the standard on these issues. This kind of information and this work is something we very much rely on. With our own Bill, we were hoping to set a standard that could be used but we will bring that up on Committee Stage, when we can discuss this in greater detail. All of this work needs to be crafted in consultation with whistleblowers, legal practitioners and academics in order that we can draw on the highest standards of national whistleblowing legislation across the various EU jurisdictions. We see what the Nordic countries have done in this regard. I think we can be the shining light on this, given we owe so much to our whistleblowers.We had hoped any research that could be done within the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach would have assisted with this Bill being undertaken. We have to give credit to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach for the massive job of work it did. It gave the Bill the seriousness it warranted, which helped pave the way for the substantial report that was issued as a result. We heard the testimony of many whistleblowers and they worked in the public and the private sector in junior and senior positions and they were from all different backgrounds. They were all united in one factor; each and every one of them spoke out because they believed it served the public interest and that the public had a right to know. Most importantly, they recognised that if the public knew what was going on, it would not accept it, which was the crux of the matter. The committee also heard the expert opinion of groups like Transparency International and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and we heard from members of the bodies representing the legal profession and those working in mental health services. These people also played a valuable role in helping to shape the 60 recommendations issued in the pre-legislative scrutiny report. The Minister recently said to me that he judges each and every Bill on its merits and so do we. I have to be fair to the Minister and I acknowledge those areas where he made amendments in line with the Bill Deputy Buckley and I brought forward and in line with the recommendations of the committee and that is welcome. It is good to see that co-operative work and to hear the Minister say he will continue to work with us. Section 4 includes the expansion of the meaning of ""work"", which is extremely important because it includes volunteers and that is an area where there can be concerns. That should have included journalists as well but we will bring that to Committee Stage and we can talk about that in greater detail then. I welcome the expansion of that meaning because it will be of relief to many. There are also areas we probably could have worked on. I see that, for example, the Minister has included an exemption for organisations with fewer than 50 employees. It is not that costly to put this in place and that is probably unnecessary. We can talk about that in greater detail another time. The Bill will establish a new protected disclosures office within the Office of the Ombudsman. Concerns have been raised about this and we need to be frank about that. Some people have concerns that protected disclosures could be sent to a letter box or a filing cabinet but it is up to us to make sure that does not happen. We need to be clear that this will set a standard and that it does not end up being that kind of thing and we need to make sure that as many people as possible have full confidence in it. We need to be clear that this office is staffed correctly and resourced appropriately. I raised the issue of staff qualification numbers and funding with the Minister at the start of the month and we need to make sure that office is fully resourced and staffed. When I raised that point at the start of the month, the Minister said he was still working on that so we need to make sure we have those details and I had hoped to have them before this Bill was brought before the Dáil. Hopefully we will get that information soon because it is important for the confidence of those past and future whistleblowers in the system. A lot of them, including the ones we have listened to, have been failed. We need to acknowledge that and make sure they know we are taking this very seriously. The Bill will introduce new and restrictive conditions for public service workers looking to make a protected disclosure to the Minister. Another point on which we raised concern is the so-called emergency situation the Minister is proposing to put on public service whistleblowers for making a protected disclosure to the Minister and that is regressive. Concerns were raised when it was discussed in the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach that this could lower existing standards. As the committee recommended, this should have been removed. It is good to see that penalisation will include vexatious proceedings and attempting to hinder further reporting. That is important and something we had a lot of conversations about during Committee Stage. My party will support this Bill. We are looking forward to the Committee Stage debate to discuss it, to see what our different recommendations are and to see how we can work together to ensure we do what is best in the interests of everyone and of whistleblowers. When we talk about the best interests of whistleblowers we mean the best interests of everyone because the work whistleblowers do is essential to everyone in this State."	spk_219

Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-02-15	dail	33	Tackling the cost of living - Institutional Investors in the Residential Property Market: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_23	This time last month  We often hear from the Government that it is all about supply. As long as we are increasing the supply of homes, by whatever means, we can bring down rents. We know, however, and we have seen that funds are more than happy to let their properties sit idle, if they cannot get someone to pay that rent. They do not want to allow a situation where rents are falling, which will mean a falling yield on their asset. They are happy to maintain a situation of high rents. A few months ago, right outside where I live in my estate in Mervue, Galway, one of these build-to-rents was given planning permission for apartments to be constructed just outside Mervue. The people of Mervue were not happy to see that because, once again, they know and will see that their children and grandchildren will not benefit from this. They will not be able to pay those rents. It will just push them further away from home ownership and from even being able to rent. The reality is the Government's housing policy is destroying generations of young people and older people. When I hear Ministers telling us that the Government's housing policy is working, I do not disagree with them. For me, the operational question is who exactly is it working for? Who is it benefiting? The answer is the investment funds and the large private developers serving them because our rental crisis, and that of the people of Galway, means record profits for them. 	spk_241

We fully support their call for a full statutory inquiry. We commend their courage and bravery. We believe them and we will continue to stand with them. I have no doubt of the massive toll this has taken on them. Like many whistleblowers, they went through an incredibly difficult process to bring this to light and, like many whistleblowers, they were driven by what is right. These women have helped to blow the whistle on extremely serious allegations of abuse, sexual abuse, harassment and discrimination. The fact that an organisation set up to protect could enact this kind of treatment on those within its own ranks is dumbfounding. Like so many whistleblowers before them, the official channels failed them.  The measures proposed by the Minister to investigate these allegations are so inadequate as to be almost offensive. They are, in the words of these women, ineffective and powerless to get to the real heart of the issue. These women deserve a hell of a lot better than this. These issues are long-standing; we all know this. Dr. Tom Clonan's research into this kind of abuse laid it out in painstaking detail. As part of his research, 60 female soldiers, sailors and air crew were surveyed. Of these, 59 reported they had suffered abuse or discrimination and 12 said they had been sexually assaulted or raped. At first, there were attempts to discredit this research before eventually the findings were accepted and we were told it would never happen again. Yet, as Dr. Clonan said, the culture continues. It was only a couple of weeks ago that members of the Government said in this House that we had to change how women are treated in this State. It is now within the power of the Minister to change how all women are treated. It is within his power to change how women in our military are treated. These women should be given the statutory inquiry for which they are calling.	spk_266
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-02-03	dail	33	Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_39	We are all acutely aware of the issues arising from the increases in the cost of living and the impact these have had in recent months. We have had debate after debate on this issue in the Chamber in recent weeks. We need to see strong action to help those who are struggling most. We have all seen the impact of the increases in the costs of electricity and fuel in our electricity bills. I am sure many of us got our electricity bill through the door and were surprised at the significant rise in the bills. We also see it at the petrol pumps. The impact on lower income households has been catastrophic. It is a cause of concern and distress and there are things they must do without. These increases in prices mean they simply do not have additional spare cash lying around to help them to pay for this. All Members are seeing this in our clinics and when knocking on doors. I hold a weekly clinic and I knock on doors every week. The main issue that keeps coming up is that people are just not able to pay for things. One man told me this week that he had to sleep in the kitchen to keep warm. He cannot use the shower in the winter months because the bathroom is the coldest room in his house so he must use an alternative place for showering. That is a cold, hard fact. Many of us would find it unimaginable to have to go through that ourselves. This problem is not completely new. In November 2021, my colleague, Deputy Claire Kerrane, conducted a survey to which 14,000 people responded. Any Members who have conducted surveys will know that getting 14,000 respondents shows how live an issue this is. Of those who responded, 93% said they had seen a massive increase in energy prices. Of the 6,000 comments in the survey there are two statements I particularly want to read to the Minister of State. One person said:As a pensioner, I can’t live on what’s left [each week]. I pay my electricity by card at An Post. I can’t afford groceries and eat the bare minimum. Life is very hard.Another said:Currently battling with high anxiety because I don’t know if I will be able to pay rent/electricity every month or pay for diesel. I’m a single mother of a 10 yr old boy … and on his Santa list he asked Santa to help his Mam be OK. Even my 10 yr old son can see I’m not OK any more.This is the reality. We need strong and urgent action from the Government. We need to see a ban on rent increases and one month's rent going back into the renters' pockets. We need to see the discretionary fund increased and more people being able to apply for the fuel allowance.	spk_329
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-02-03	dail	33	Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_46	"We can see from the Government amendment that it is, at best, kicking the can down the road by having a Second Reading in nine months and, at worst, shooting this legislation down. As I have said previously to the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Ossian Smyth, we are here to offer solutions. The Government asks us to offer solutions.However, it is fair to say the Government just is not interested in our solutions, even on occasions such as today when we explicitly state that we are willing and happy to work with it. The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, stated yesterday at committee that he judges each and every Bill on its own merits, but he and the Minister of State should also judge each Bill in light of the Stage it is at in the Dáil. We are here on Second Stage of this Bill brought forward by me and Deputy Clarke. If it is allowed to proceed to Committee Stage, we will be able to work on any issues the Ministers have. We could consider amendments and different provisions. We could work together constructively on this and then everyone would be a winner. The review of the FOI regime was announced by the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, back in June. I made a detailed submission on it, trying to be constructive on my end. It should be noted, however, that when the Minister announced the review, he told us the regime was robust and functioning well. Obviously, we then had the likes of Zapponegate, in which it appears that official correspondence was deleted. It was clear the regime was in crisis well before that but at that point it became extremely clear. I will never forget listening to ""Morning Ireland"" last September and hearing the Tánaiste state the Minister was due to announce a review of the FOI legislation. Of course, he knew the Minister had already announced the review in June of that year. That showed the lack of urgency and understanding of the importance of FOI there was and is at the Cabinet table. We need to put a new and important emphasis on it. We have known the regime has been in crisis for a long time. In 2018,  We have a real opportunity with this Bill. The ongoing FOI review and the wider review of the ethics framework are important but we need to look at the role FOI will play in improving transparency and accountability. Will it be broadened, deepened and reinvigorated? What role will the Standards in Public Office Commission play in respect of those who are failing in their obligations under the FOI Act? Will it continue to be a body that regularly asks for increased powers but rarely gets them, or will it become a new force for transparency and accountability, as envisioned by the Public Sector Standards Bill which every party in this House supported? Our Bill would empower SIPO to investigate complaints in respect of those who are failing in their FOI duties. I acknowledge that at the committee yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, mentioned concerns regarding how exactly that would happen but I again make the point that it is on Committee Stage that those concerns can be addressed. Let us have those conversations and work together to thrash these things out. That is what committees can and should do. Our Bill would require the Minister to conduct an annual review to ascertain what public bodies need to be brought more fully within the remit of FOI. For example, some public bodies are only partially under FOI. It would also ensure there is no time gap in FOI coverage. As we know, certain bodies do not fall under it for the first six months. That is an issue of concern. Under the Bill, public bodies will come straight under the remit of FOI. The Bill also attempts to bring back within the remit of FOI pension information in respect of retired taoisigh, tánaistí and Ministers. While the Minister also expressed concern in that regard yesterday, we are more than happy to sit down with him and the Minister of State and their officials to listen to their concerns, as would be done if the Bill moved to Committee Stage. We need to allow that to happen. We need to allow the Bill to pass Second Stage because we have a real opportunity here, especially in light of the ongoing FOI review and the review of the ethics frameworks. I acknowledge the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, has a particular interest in this issue and conducted the review in June. However, I am also aware we need quick action on that because not every Minister will always have an interest in FOI. The Minister has such an interest, as does the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, so let us do something about this urgently. Let us act on it now and bring the Bill drafted by me and my colleague to the next Stage in order that we can ensure there are amendments and this is progressed. The review was announced in June, many months ago. What we need now is action on it because it is not something new. Anyone who has had an interest in FOI has known there have been concerns and issues. We need to act on it. As the Minister has carried out extensive engagement on the issue, let us act on it. Let us bring the Bill to Committee Stage and have that conversation and we can work together pragmatically. I would like the Minister of State to refrain from moving the proposed amendment in order that we can bring the Bill to Committee Stage. It is important. We can work together. Is that not what this Chamber is all about - Deputies working together to get good legislation for the benefit of people?"	spk_390

Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-02-01	dail	33	Legacy Issues in Northern Ireland and New Decade New Approach: Statements	dbsect_15	Families' quest for truth and justice is not a quest with an infinite amount of time. So many families who have had family members murdered due to British state collusion have seen the parents, partners, siblings and children of those killed pass away without the truth behind their loved ones' killings being known. There needs to be a sense of urgency about this. This weekend marked the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. Like the Minister, Deputy Coveney, I was in Derry to see the families walk the route their loved ones walked that day and one thing that struck me was that many family members who were walking that route were far too young to have been there that day. Operation Greenwich dates from the late 1980s and early 1990s, and everyone affected at that time would now be in their 30s or older, and many now have children and grandchildren. All of those family members are affected by that trauma, the inter-generational trauma. People have passed away but have passed on the baton for truth and justice to the next generation. Now we see grandchildren standing just as invested as those who were there on the day. The next generation are informed, educated and ready to continue the campaign for truth and justice. The days of tea and sympathy are long gone and families are clear on this. People have rights under international law and it is time that they were met. The British state and the Irish State have obligations in this regard. There is no longer any question as to the role of the British state in the killings of people in Ireland and the evidence of collusion by Britain is now irrefutable. We now have official Government reports which outline the role of collusion. We have, from the report recently published, evidence that military intelligence of the British Government oversaw the importation of South African weapons to be used by loyalist paramilitary groups to kill nationalists, republicans and Catholics. Some of these weapons were used in the attack on mourners in Milltown Cemetery in 1988 where John Murray, Caoimhín Mac Brádaigh and Thomas McErlean were murdered as they defended other mourners and saved lives that day. The fact that these weapons were imported from South Africa, with British intelligence knowledge, and used in this way is grotesque. This report also shockingly states that an assistant chief constable of the RUC, now deceased, was aware that the names of 250 Catholics that came from the British army were in the hands of the UDA. It also states that this assistant chief constable intervened to stop those people, whose names were passed to the UDA, getting a warning that their lives were in danger. Some of those 250 people were dead within months. Let the gravity of that sink in. It is important to realise that when we hear media reports that this report shows the RUC did not pass on information, the reality of that is that people were dead within months. This was not simply a piece of information. This was people's lives, people who died and whose families’ lives were destroyed. We are now awaiting the publishing of a report by the Police Ombudsman at the start of next week which will deal with the killings of Sinn Féin members, Pat McBride and Paddy Loughran, who were murdered 30 years ago this week in the Sinn Féin centre in Belfast along with Michael Dwyer, a constituent who was in the advice centre at that time. This week also marks the 30th anniversary of the attack on the Ormeau Road bookies which killed five people and injured seven. The reason I mention both of these is because they will be dealt with in this report. That these families have to wait 30 years for information is absolutely horrific. What we now know - something the people of Belfast, the people of Derry, the people of the North and the people whose families were killed by British state collusion knew all along - and that there is no denying is that collusion was policy. We saw that with de Silva and we see it in the 19 killings in Operation Greenwich. This was not a coincidence. This was not a few rotten apples. This was British Government policy. I have faith because I have faith in the families' resilience and in their courage and I know that one day the truth will out but there is a responsibility on all of us to stand with these families, to stand up to the British Government and its proposals and amnesty and to make sure that truth and justice comes about.	spk_249
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-01-26	dail	33	Cost of Living: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Labour Party for bringing forward this timely and appropriate motion. We all know that people have had it extremely hard for the last two years with the Covid-19 pandemic. So many people lost their jobs or were out of work for periods of time and some were on reduced hours as a result of necessary closures to deal with the pandemic. We also know that many businesses have struggled to keep their doors open. Now as restrictions are easing, ordinary workers and families are faced with a crisis that they have been facing for some time but that has reached a peak, namely a crisis in the cost of living. This crisis has grown over the years as the Government continues to fail to tackle the big issues of the day, such as housing and the cost of childcare. In October, my colleague Deputy Kerrane conducted a survey on this and she has been leading on this issue. The survey was specifically on the cost of living and we had 14,000 respondents and 6,000 comments about what ordinary workers and families were experiencing in the cost of living. The Minister of State will know that 14,000 respondents is a massive number, which shows the scale of the crisis. The level of response is indicative of same. It was truly shocking to see that 55% of those who responded were working full-time. They said that the cost of living was pushing them further into poverty and that they were struggling to pay the bills, keep the house warm and keep the lights on. That is a failure of this Government. We need action from the Government that is commensurate with the scale of the crisis. We are all acutely aware of the geopolitical pressures that have led to a rise in the price of energy and we are all aware that inflation is at an all-time high. However, the Government cannot blame external factors for its lack of action. I heard the Taoiseach yesterday blame Russia and Vladimir Putin during Leaders’ Questions for the rise in the cost of living. Again, we are all aware of the geopolitical nature of some of these price rises but the Taoiseach can hardly blame them for his lack of action or for the fact that childcare costs continue to rise. Housing rents and prices have risen year-on-year due to Government inaction and the lack of supply of affordable housing so that people can get their feet on the property ladder. We need something that the Government cannot say it does not know about and for which Sinn Féin has been calling for a long number of years. We need a three-year ban on rent increases and renters need to see one month’s rent going back into their pockets. We need to see an end to the carbon tax hikes which are increasing the burden on those suffering from fuel poverty. We need to see the Government stand up to the insurance companies and ensure that ordinary people stop getting ripped off with rising premiums. We need to see a full plan of action on childcare costs. My colleague Deputy Funchion has a clear plan for same, something we have outlined in our budget proposals and she has outlined time and again, which would cut the cost of childcare by two thirds. The cost of childcare is prohibitive and is locking people out of the workforce, especially women. The Government must legislate to ensure that all workers earn a decent living wage. It was slightly laughable that the Minister of State mentioned in his amendment that we need to be concerned that wage growth in excess of other economies erodes our competitiveness. I did not see that concern when we saw the increase in the wage of the Secretary General of the Department of Health and I did not see that international comparison then. The Minister of State can correct me if he disagrees but it would appear to me that this attitude is targeted towards people on low wages. I want to raise the issue of people in Galway city and county who are struggling to get by as a result of the cost of living. I have been knocking on doors in Galway city every week and it is this issue that comes up most. We see that people are struggling to keep a car on the road and that car is necessary for them to drive to work as a result of the lack of buses. They are also struggling to keep their homes adequately heated during the cold winter months and they are finding it increasingly difficult to put food on their tables. Last week Social Justice Ireland told us that one fifth of people are living in poverty when their housing costs are factored in and that 300,000 people were forced into poverty last year. We need action from Government and we need it now.	spk_29
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-01-26	dail	33	Post-European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_16	Regarding the recent forced displacement of Palestinian households in occupied East Jerusalem, the UN last week urged Israel to halt all evictions and demolitions in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, immediately after a family was forced out of their home the previous day. I am referring to the Salhieh family. They bought their house in Sheikh Jarrah in 1967, which is a long time ago. It was before this State had joined the EU and at a time when Eamon de Valera was the President. It should go without saying therefore, that, the Salhieh's claim to this land goes way back, and yet an Israeli court has just ruled against the family being allowed to remain in their home. On Wednesday, Israeli police raided the Salhieh home, forcibly removed the family and then demolished their property. Some 25 family members and supporters who had been demonstrating were arrested. That is just awful. Both Houses have passed a motion to recognise the state of Palestine, but the Government has not formally granted recognition and has said it wishes to do that as part of a wider EU move. The Minister for Foreign Affairs needs to start leading from the front at EU Council meetings and start pushing the EU Council to act. I ask that all diplomatic channels at EU level be used to demand that Israeli authorities stop such actions.	spk_337

After being elected to the Dáil I took a particular interest in and focus on the crisis in the mental health services in Galway, as the Minister of State is aware. I conducted a survey of young people and people across Galway who have used, and indeed not used, the mental health services in Galway. I have met and spoken to a number of mental health service providers in Galway. One thing that came to the fore among the people who engaged directly with myself, through the survey or in other ways, was the availability of mental health services outside of normal business hours. There was a particular focus on this, and a lot of people felt that they had no option other than to attend at an accident and emergency department, when they felt that perhaps the accident and emergency department was not the appropriate place for them to go at that time. There were a variety of different responses from the people who spoke to me. One person said that in multiple instances they were turned away from the accident and emergency department after the GP had recommended them to go there. Another person reported that the accident and emergency department advised them to wait until the mental health clinic opened, but they left and felt vulnerable without support. Others said that they went to the accident and emergency department and that they had a great experience. The wide array of experiences is not surprising, but the reality is that people felt they had no other option at that point. Figures recently released by my party colleague Deputy Ward indicate that there were not sufficient levels of staff such as liaison psychiatrists in our emergency departments. This adds more to those concerns and the fact that people do not have any other option, the concern being that a relevantly qualified person may not be available to assist the person who walks through the door. Another issue that concerns me is the fact that young people in Galway had the highest waiting times in the State for an appointment with Jigsaw, with some people waiting up to 20 weeks. The Minister of State will be aware that as an adult 20 weeks is a very long time - it is five months - but for children that feels a lot longer. It can take a significant amount of time for a person to come forward to say that they need help, but to have to wait that length of time really adds to it. This really needs to be tackled.	spk_429

One of the reasons for this, which the Tánaiste mentioned yesterday, was that many of those excluded would benefit from the additional bank holiday. I will tell the Minister who will not benefit from an additional bank holiday: the thousands of carers in this State who do not get a day off. Will the Minister explain why he excluded carers from receiving this bonus?	spk_1
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-01-20	dail	33	Public Sector Pay	dbsect_2	Carers lost everything during the pandemic. They lost their day services and respite, including their unofficial respite in the form of help from grandparents and other family members when we were all told to isolate, keep apart and stay in our homes. As for the parents of children in special schools, even those schools for children with severe to profound intellectual disabilities closed. For children and parents alike, their lifeline was gone. The workload of family carers increased monumentally overnight with no time to prepare. They were on the front line of this pandemic. Let us be frank, we all relied on their work. Without this and the Government being able to rely on the phenomenal work of carers, the Government would have been in a real predicament. I simply cannot understand how they have been left behind again.	spk_3
Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-01-20	dail	33	Public Sector Pay	dbsect_2	I am specifically asking the Minister why he decided to exclude carers from this bonus. We know there was a real-life impact on the lives of family carers. Many carers approached me, as I am sure they did the Minister, during the course of the pandemic to explain just how difficult the loss of services had been for them and not only how hard it was for them then but how it has had a long-term impact on them. Carers told me of the severe sleep disruption experienced by those who they care for and how at some points the entire family functioned on almost no sleep or very little sleep. They told me how the lack of services caused significant emotional distress and frustration for some of the most vulnerable in our society with some injuring themselves and others doing so accidentally by sheer frustration. This was a daily life faced by many carers during the many months of lockdown. I am at a loss as to why carers have been excluded.	spk_5

Mairead Farrell	41	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2022-01-19	dail	33	Gender-based Violence: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_13	Our nation's attention is currently focused on violence against women due to the horrific murder of Ashling Murphy. I know that all our thoughts are with her family and loved ones. Sadly, however, this is only the most recent violent attack against a woman to horrify our nation. We have a long and shameful history regarding the treatment of women and girls in this State. We must be under no illusion that this history has had an impact on the deeply ingrained misogynistic abuse directed towards women. We see it in the way that women and girls were treated in Magdalen laundries; in the way women's healthcare is cast aside; in the way women's bodies, tone, image and behaviour are strictly policed in public discourse; in the way women have been forced to travel to get abortions; in the way our bodily autonomy has been denied to us by this State; in the culture of shame that puts the burden on us to talk about the violence we have experienced in hushed tones; and in the immediate and severe backlash and victim blaming if we dare to speak out. We know that 90% of sexual assault takes place within relationships and that we do not have adequate services in place to support survivors of domestic abuse. This includes refuge space, but it is broader than that. I have been contacted by women who are trying to get out of their current relationships but there are economic factors which severely restrict their ability to keep themselves and their children safe. It is so difficult for any person to get away from their abuser but for women in poverty, women whose abusers control their finances and women who are isolated socially, it is all the more difficult. In the past week, I have often thought about Manuela Riedo, who was raped and murdered in Galway. Many aspects of Ashling's case reminded me of that horrible attack. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam dílis. Since Manuela's murder, 105 women have lost their lives in Ireland. We cannot wait for another woman's murder to tackle the culture of misogyny and put policies in place to counteract it.	spk_226

They pay no corporation tax or capital gains tax. I have a quote from the Minister of State from an RTÉ Radio 1 interview he did earlier this year. He said that on any profits being made there is a tax of 20% or 25% depending on the structure and that any profits they make are taxed at a higher rate: ""double the rate of corporation tax"" as the Minister of State put it. We have looked at the figures and the Minister of State’s statement simply was not true. The figure of 17.9% the Minister of State was citing was relative to the taxable event, meaning distributions to shareholders; it was not relative to rental profits. In 2019 tax paid by IREFs relative to pre-tax profit was 9.1%, which was less than the 25% paid by any other landlord and less than the 12.5% paid by any other company. Furthermore we know these funds pay no capital gains tax or corporation tax whatsoever. The Government’s defence of these funds snapping up homes at the expense of renters and struggling home buyers is that they stimulate supply. However, the financial stability review published by the Central Bank last month found that the majority of residential units purchased by investment funds were existing and not new stock.

Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-12-15	dail	33	Finance Bill 2021: From the Seanad	dbsect_21	I will speak to the three recommendations and I will keep it brief so that there will be lots of time for others. Recommendations Nos. 1 and 2 provide for the extension of the existing rates of the EWSS until the end of January 2022 in response to public health restrictions which will impact the footfall in and revenue of businesses in certain sectors in the coming months. The hospitality sector is especially impacted. This extension is a common-sense measure and one that Sinn Féin called for on 30 November. The Government decided on the measure prior to the subsidy rates being cut on 1 December. This delayed response is to be welcomed. I note that the Minister performed a U-turn in respect of reversing the wage subsidy cuts, having announced on 3 December that he would provide targeted supports. Those announced proposals were consigned to the dustbin, with an admission that they could not have been implemented with the necessary speed. This is evidence of a lack of planning in the Department, particularly regarding the tailoring of supports over time to those sectors most impacted. What we have now are economy-wide supports for what is, for the most part, a sector-specific issue. I remind the House that my colleague, Deputy Doherty, submitted an amendment 16 months ago to alter the EWSS in order that different rates of payments could be applied to different sectors.This proposal was rejected on the grounds that one sector could not be prioritised above another. This justification was somewhat undermined by the roll-out of the CRSS months later, which only provides support to consumer-facing businesses and was therefore sector-specific for all intents and purposes. I ask the Minister and his Department to examine the possibility of tailoring the wage subsidy scheme to provide tailored supports for specific sectors. We will be supporting this recommendation given its overall objective to support employment. Recommendation No. 3 provides for the extension of the CRSS. Given the impact of the latest public health restrictions on the night-time and experience economy this is a common-sense recommendation that Sinn Féin will be supporting to ensure that supports to that sector are provided to protect employment, businesses and livelihoods. 	spk_195
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-12-14	dail	33	European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_19	I wish the raise the case of Julian Assange again. Last Friday, it took just nine minutes for the British magistrates to uphold an American appeal against a district court judge's ruling that Julian Assange should not be extradited. That judge had accepted in January that hell on earth was what awaited Julian Assange and that extradition would mean he would likely take his own life. On hearing the news that this ruling had been overturned, Julian Assange had a stroke, such is the stress and mental anguish his extradition has caused him. To call that decision justice would be a crime against the English language for the extradition is not just a miscarriage of justice but also an onslaught against justice and on journalism and free speech. In an age when the media are now driven by clickbait, ad traffic sensationalism, conventional wisdom commentary, access and embedded journalism, Mr. Assange's work, which revealed war crimes, atrocities and the destruction of civil liberties by the US military and its allies, shone like a light in the darkness. I have raised this case several times in exactly this slot, statements on European Council meetings. When we see what happened last Friday and the anguish Julian Assange is in and see the work he did, it is time for the Government to step up and to speak up for journalism and for Julian Assange.	spk_217

Let us imagine a context where a landlord has issued a notice to quit. Anxiety would set in as the people concerned desperately search for somewhere to live. It may prove impossible, however, to find anywhere affordable. The housing assistance payment, HAP, may not be sufficient to cover the rent of any of those places which are available. The clock will tick down for people in that situation and soon enough they will find themselves homeless. People in such a scenario would then present themselves to their local authority as being homeless and that is a devastating prospect for any family. We should think about that reality and how it feels for any individual or family to be in such a situation. This has become an all-too-common reality for many of our people. Currently, some 61 families in Galway city have received notices to quit and have presented themselves to city hall as being in need of assistance. These families will experience incredible fear and anxiety during Christmas and great uncertainty about what will happen in the new year. This legislation would give them much relief. These 61 families are in addition to those currently in homeless accommodation. Some 27 families are in homeless hubs, while 53 families are in private emergency accommodation. Therefore, a total of 80 families are facing Christmas without a place to call home. As we know, many people in homeless accommodation are told to look for HAP accommodation. The reality, however, is that there are often no properties available within the limits of the HAP payments. This is an issue which keeps arising in Galway city and this precarious housing situation has been created by this Government and its forebears.  In Galway city, more money has again been allocated this year for homeless emergency services. While this year-on-year increase is needed, it does not address people’s housing needs and the requirement to build more houses. I am pleased to see that the Government is not opposing our legislation. It is fantastic to see cross-party solidarity in bringing forward this legislation based on work done by the Simon Communities of Ireland. However, we need action in this regard. We cannot have a situation where homelessness is discussed in this Chamber each Christmas and people say how terrible it is, only for very little to be done about it and the subject is then discussed again the following year. I hope therefore that this Bill will be the start of a new collaboration between the Government and the Opposition to tackle homelessness.	spk_274

I am delighted to speak alongside my colleague, Deputy Patricia Ryan, on the Second Stage debate of our Bill. I might say a few words on what motivated us to table it, why it is necessary and how it will improve the regulation of tender bids for capital works. We are firmly of the opinion that, if enacted, it will improve value for money for the taxpayer when it comes to large capital projects. It is no secret this State often encounters significant problems in getting value for money for large capital projects, which can often arise from poor regulation. Most people will be aware the new national children's hospital is expected to be the most expensive hospital in the world, given its latest estimated final cost is €2 billion, having run over cost by well over 100%. The national broadband plan has also proved a fiasco, with its latest estimated cost standing at €3 billion, a cost overrun of approximately 500%. This is by no means a recent phenomenon. In 1999, the national road improvement works for the likes of motorways, primary roads and the M50 was completed. It began with an estimated cost of €7 billion but its final cost was more than double that, at €15.5 billion, a cost overrun of 125%. In 2005, the Luas green line cross-city extension was completed at a final cost of €991 million, just shy of the €1 billion mark, and its initial cost was estimated at €358 million, meaning it ran over cost by 161%. One year later, the Dublin Port tunnel was completed and, aside from the poor planning that meant it is unable to take the largest trucks coming to and from the port, it ran over cost by €295 million, or 65%. Four years later, Dublin Airport terminal 2 was completed having overshot the mark by €139 million. I could go on but I think we get the point. Cost overruns can arise, as we know, from a wide range of factors. There can be poor planning on the part of the contracting authority or the contractor, litigation arising from contractual disputes, poor performance in the management of risks and so on, but poor value for the taxpayer can also arise for more nefarious reasons. We can take the issue of bid-rigging, a form of price-fixing behaviour by which firms co-ordinate their bids to maintain high prices, which is a serious issue. The Government recently acknowledged that with the introduction of its competition (amendment) Bill 2021. The Bill that Deputy Ryan and I have tabled is designed to target another source of cost overruns, namely, those arising from the issue of abnormally low tender bids in the procurement process for capital works. These abnormally low bids are sometimes referred to as lowball offers and they can be one contributor, albeit a significant one, to cost overruns. In practice, these abnormally low bids are often as a result of a contractor submitting a very low bid. In the case of the building of a school or hospital, for example, given the heavy focus on lowest price criteria in this State, a contracting authority may choose the lowest offer believing it to be the best value for money. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the contract may then run over cost, leading to poor value for money for the taxpayer. This is something the Tánaiste himself has acknowledged is a serious problem, when he stated, ""... some companies [are] lowballing, coming in with very low tender prices to get the contract and then coming back with claims thereafter."" Another angle to the Bill concerns a matter that is quite topical and that must be dealt with in as timely a fashion as possible, namely, the issue of bogus self-employment. The Committee of Public Accounts has been dealing with this issue in depth and our Bill will help to tackle one aspect of this kind of fraud. A great deal of bogus self-employment takes place in the construction sector. If, for instance, a contractor misclassifies a significant number of its workers as self-employed, it will dodge the employer PRSI and other obligations and reduce the overall labour cost. This means the contractor could submit an abnormally low bid and win the competition for the contract. As for how our Bill would address these issues, the European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations 2016, which govern this area, allow for bids that are abnormally low to be excluded from the process. That legislation does not, however, define an ""abnormally low bid"", which means strong subjectivity is involved and contracting authorities can, understandably, be hesitant to exclude contractors from the process. Our Bill will enact a new objective criterion such that, where four or more tender bids are submitted for a public works contract or a works contract of contract value equal to or more than the EU threshold value, a bid that is more than 15% below the adjusted average will be considered abnormally low and rejected if it cannot be adequately explained to the contracting authority. If a contractor makes an abnormally low bid for a contract, thus claiming it can complete the contract at a significantly lower cost than its competitors, it must explain to the contracting authority how this is achievable. If the contracting authority does not receive a reasonable explanation for the abnormally low bid submitted, it will be rejected and the contractor disqualified from the procurement process. The contracting authority should record the reason for rejection and submit it to the Office of Government Procurement, OGP. The Bill will also ensure that poor performance in prior public contracts will be grounds for exclusion from participation in procurement procedure. Where these contractors have shown significant or persistent deficiencies or failures in the performance of public contracts, the contracting authority, such as the local authority, should record the reasons for the rejection and submit them to the OGP. The State needs to improve regulatory oversight and enforcement when it comes to certain aspects of public procurement, a view backed up by a number of studies by the likes of the World Bank, Transparency International and the OECD. The OGP does not provide a regulatory function and contracting authorities often lack the capacity to carry this out themselves, which is why legislation is needed in this regard. This legislation is reasonable and desirable and would lead to better value for the taxpayer in the context of large capital projects and the cost overruns that often arise. It will also help to tackle one aspect of bogus self-employment. We often hear the Government talk of fiscal prudence - it has become something of a watchword - but it seems to do little to tighten regulations that would ensure the prudent fiscal management of the public finances regarding procurement. While the OGP has no regulatory function, the interim procurement reform board that has been established is not on a statutory footing and thus is limited in what it can do. That makes legislation in this regard all the more important. Deputy Ryan and myself are presenting a simple and clear-cut measure that could help tackle abnormally low bids, or lowball offers as they are more commonly known. The legislation is reasonable and will give guidance in the form of an objective criterion about what should be deemed to be an abnormally low bid. Without it, that is an extremely difficult matter to assess and we must ask contracting authorities to do it.  The Bill will also allow the contractor to explain its abnormally low bid. It might be the case that the bid is in fact fair and the contractor might have a reason for how low it is. For example, it may have devised some innovative industrial process or gained access to cheaper materials. We are not saying that just because it is an abnormally low bid, we should not take it, but it is important we have information on why it is low. The contractor may have found a more effective way of doing business and, therefore, its bid could still be permitted. Crucially, however, it will also allow poor performance in prior public contracts to be a ground for a contractor to be excluded from participation in a procurement procedure for capital works. In light of the scandals there have been, and of companies wilfully and recklessly dodging their PRSI obligations, are these the kinds of companies we want to win public contracts? Surely not. I urge the Minister of State and all Deputies to support the Bill."	spk_328
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-12-09	dail	33	Regulation of Tenderers Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_40	"I am fed up of coming in here and being told the Government wants to work with the Opposition but the Opposition and Sinn Féin do not give the Government any ideas and do not do anything. Every time I come in here with any kind of a Bill, all I hear from Government is that it will kick the can down the road for nine months, it will not engage on it, it disagrees, it will not bring the Bill to Committee Stage, it will not have the discussion or look at it. It does my head in. We put work into these things. We look at these proposals and we are willing to work. I was very clear in my opening statement that I am happy to work with the Government on this, as my colleague, Deputy Doherty also said. We can bring it to Committee Stage and look at the different suggestions and amendments the Government has. However, again from the Government the answer is ""No"". The Government is not happy to work with the Opposition on different Bills it is bringing forward. This is the fourth piece of legislation that I have brought before the Dáil. That is not just an easy thing we do overnight. It takes a great deal of work. If the Government is not willing to engage with the Opposition on different Bills and proposals, I am really disheartened and shocked. The Government is not implementing the stuff that needs to be implemented to ensure this is dealt with. The Minister of State was talking about cost overruns. We are not saying this is a panacea for cost overruns, far from it. I said that very clearly. We need to look at the issue of abnormally lowball offers, however. This is not just something my party is talking about. It is something those on the Government benches have spoken about as well. There is no definition for that. That is what the experts in procurement law say.There is no clear definition. The Minister of State said that in deciding to award a public contract, a balance needs to be struck between value for money and a quality project outcome. We are all saying that. It is clear that it needs to be done. We are not saying it needs to be in just one sense or the other. The Minister of State stated the existing regulations already impose a duty on contracting authorities to require economic operators to explain the price or cost proposed where tenders seem abnormally low as to works, supplies and services. I will table a parliamentary question to find out how many bidders Departments have disqualified on grounds of abnormally low tenders. I would be really interested in knowing that. The Minister of State also stated the provisions in the Bill seek to define an abnormally low tender where no such definition exists in the regulations or EU directives. We have a definition. The Minister of State is concerned about the definition. We would be willing to work with him on this. That is the whole point of this Parliament. The whole point is that we are supposed to work together to get the best outcome for the taxpayer and ordinary people. To be honest, I have not seen many best outcomes for ordinary people from this Government at all. I am really annoyed about this. As the Minister of State knows, I am always willing to work with the Government. I am always very calm and collected — most of the time anyway — but this really does annoy me. The Minister of State said the Bill, as drafted, would drive tender prices higher than might otherwise be bid as contractors seek to avoid the examination that follows the identification of an abnormally low tender based on the formula proposed. It should not be very difficult. We are not trying to make it more difficult; we are just trying to deal with the issue. We should not be running scared of this. We know we have an issue so we should deal with it and make it easier for people. The Minister of State also stated the Bill could disadvantage smaller contractors who may be able to offer prices that are lower than those of their larger competitors. I said very clearly in my opening speech that there could be reasons for having a lower tender. That is brilliant; fair play to those concerned. The Minister of State, however, is referring to disadvantaging smaller contractors. Unfortunately, my colleague Deputy Stanley is gone. He has done significant work on community wealth building. I cannot wait to see the work the Government has done in this regard. I have said most of what I have time to say. I am genuinely disappointed. We are putting together legislation and want to work with the Government and have the best outcome. We are all supposed to be doing our best for the public, the taxpayer. The Government's position is really disheartening and frustrating. I will be introducing another Bill in a few weeks and I look forward to the Minister of State supporting it."	spk_340
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-12-02	dail	33	Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill 2021: First Stage	dbsect_5	"I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and to provide for related matters.I am delighted to be introducing this Bill with my colleague Deputy Buckley. I will first say a few words on what motivated us to craft this Bill. In 2014, this State introduced the Protected Disclosures Act. This was badly needed in a State such as this, where transparency and accountability are words that are regularly invoked but seldom made a reality. Often, when people in this society try to reveal wrongdoing, there is a reflexive reaction on the part of those in authority to think of the reputation of the organisation first and crush those who are trying to blow the whistle. In many ways whistleblowers can be seen as the ethical spirit within an organisation pushing back. They are people who to try to reveal wrongdoing in the public interest and, as a consequence, often pay a very high price. Unfortunately, the protected disclosure regime has a number of weaknesses. Compounding this were our concerns that the Government’s new amending Bill could weaken protections even further. That is why an Teachta Buckley and I have brought forward this Bill. It was crafted in consultation with legal practitioners, academics lecturing on whistleblowing and whistleblowers themselves. It will do a number of things we believe will help protect those who try to reveal wrongdoing, support the public interest and help them win the redress they often deserve. It will broaden the definition of penalisation to include hindering or attempting to hinder further reporting and vexatious proceedings against a discloser. Where an employee alleges penalisation as a result of making a protected disclosure, the burden of proof will now lie with the employer to demonstrate this is not the case. The Bill also broadens the definition of employee to include those working in volunteer organisations, associated persons and journalists. It will make an offence any attempt to hinder or penalise any person for making a protected disclosure. It will provide free legal aid and psychological services for whistleblowers. It removes the limitations on financial compensation that whistleblowers can win by way of redress. Importantly, the Bill will further empower the Minister to gather all documents relevant to a protected disclosure made to him or her, regarding his or her Department or bodies under its aegis, and to pass this information on to the Attorney General in connection with the conduct of legal proceedings on behalf of the State. It will also require the Minister to lay before the Oireachtas an annual statistical protected disclosures report. Last, it satisfies the mandatory reporting requirements and other sections of the EU’s whistleblowing directive. As one of the world’s greatest whistleblowers Edward Snowden once said, ""The sad truth is that societies that demand whistleblowers be martyrs often find themselves without either, and always when it matters the most."""	spk_106

Although I wanted to be here, I was not able to attend. I welcome this discussion, which goes to the heart of everything we do and to the heart of fairness and equity. I want to agree with something that Deputy Nash said. I would imagine that most Deputies in this Chamber are in agreement with this amendment and agree that secretarial assistants are facing difficulties with regard to their pay. A lot of what has been said already deals with what we know about. We know our secretarial assistants are at the forefront of the work we do and deal with the most difficult and pressing situations. They deal with a huge number of people who are in crisis for a range of different reasons and they are the people who a lot of our constituents turn to when they are in a moment of crisis. They are the people who need to have the empathy, understanding and ability to get things done and help people when they are in that crisis situation.Many of our secretarial assistants are struggling financially. As someone who lives in Galway city where the rents are so high, I know that it is an absolute struggle for my own secretarial assistant and no doubt for other secretarial assistants in that constituency and in similar areas. This goes to the heart of fairness and equity. I agree with Deputy Bríd Smith that it is embarrassing that we are on such a high wage relative to our secretarial assistants, many of whom are struggling financially and struggling to do the work they do every single day. We are all aware of the huge volume of work that comes in to every Deputy's constituency office every day. Our secretarial assistants are dealing with people in crisis, many of whom come to our constituency offices in floods of tears. They try to assist them with issues they may never have dealt with before. They do their best to assist people in any way they can.  My party colleague, Deputy Clarke, spoke in my slot on Tuesday and said that this should not be about money but let us face facts, this will not cost an enormous amount. The report will not have a monetary implication. There is something that happens on Report Stage in this Dáil that I do not fully understand but maybe that is because I am still quite new. Obviously I am hoping the Minister will support this amendment but I do not understand why the Government does not support amendments providing for the preparation of reports when the said reports could actually assist in the formulation of Government policy and in analysing specific issues. This amendment, tabled by Deputy Pringle, is welcome and cost should not be an issue here. In the grand scheme of things, the cost of this report would not be significant. This is about equity and fairness for those people who really are on the front line in our constituency offices. We should do everything in our power to assist them and to further their case. It is really good to see cross-party support in the Chamber for this amendment. I am sure Government Deputies are also acutely aware of the struggles of their own staff as a result of their low pay. It is great that we are having this debate today and I urge the Minister to consider this amendment favourably. I do not know why this report cannot be supported. I have a question relating to what the Minister said in the Seanad yesterday. He said the commission ""makes a proposal to me, as Minister, on issues such as grading, salary rates and so on, and I then make a decision on that proposal"". I ask the Minister to detail how that actually works. Obviously we know the Oireachtas HR department had been dealing with the pay claim that was before the WRC on behalf of the commission. At the last conciliation meeting, the HR department said it could not negotiate pay, terms and conditions without the approval of the Department. At that point, the Department had failed to show up and now we are hearing the proposal for pay, terms and conditions must be brought to the Minister for approval. I am interested in hearing how that would work. I ask the Minister to confirm that the Oireachtas HR department, acting in its capacity as agent for the Oireachtas Commission, has the power to directly negotiate with workers and unions and then send the outcome of such negotiations to the Minister for approval or rejection. If this is the case, will the Minister commit to making the commission aware of the Oireachtas HR department's capacity to negotiate on its behalf in advance of the next conciliation meeting so that meaningful discussions can take place? It is good that this issue is being discussed in the House and Deputies have made quite cogent arguments as to why this needs to be addressed. I am interested in hearing the Minister's response because I missed the Second Stage debate on Tuesday. "	spk_121

I agree with Deputy Pringle. It is great that we are having this discussion and I am not suggesting that anyone would purposely forget it but I am concerned that it could slip off the radar in time. That is why I think this kind of report would be of benefit and it keeps it on the agenda which is very important. I am worried that we will be here this time next year and remember that we discussed this last year and have to ask what had happened in the interim. It is something that is so important for those who are working in our constituency offices. The report would be good and it would also keep it on the agenda and in our own minds. It is very important. Deputy Pringle said that we are used to these reports being published and the Government not accepting them. I do not understand why that is not the case. These reports can only benefit everyone, the Government and the Opposition. Sometimes it is good to think in a different way and take on the reports from Opposition parties or Independents so that they can be looked at. I am glad that the Minister is making a strong political signal on this. It is good that we had the discussion and that we all appear to be on the same page. My only concern is that we do not see this fall off the agenda.	spk_124

            The amendment calls for a report on restricting banks that were bailed out by the taxpayer from carrying forward losses against taxable profits in a manner that results in many of them paying no corporation tax whatsoever, and on the introduction of the 25% cap on profits that can be written off by carried-forward losses in any given year as well as the introduction of a ten-year limit on the use of losses for this purpose. As we enter a new phase of the pandemic, banks are returning to profitability. Indeed, the two largest banks in the sector, AIB and Bank of Ireland, are increasing in scale both with the exit of KBC and Ulster Bank from the market and as a result of recent acquisitions that they have made. Fine Gael amended a law in 2014 to remove the cap to allow bailed out banks to use 100% of the losses they incurred in previous years to be offset against future profits. Up until this change, they could only offset 50% of their prior losses against profits in any given year. We are in a unique situation in having neither a time limit nor a cap on losses that can be carried forward to write off against profits. We are the only country where such restrictions are most justified. The proposal is that the banks bailed out by the taxpayers should be required to pay corporation tax. All the amendment does is calls for a report to scrutinise this proposal and I hope that he will support this."	spk_159

We have to be cognisant of the degree and extent to which the banking market has changed. We can all say that in the past number of years much has changed in general, not just within the banking market. We had quite an interesting discussion yesterday in Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach with KBC representatives. AIB and Bank of Ireland have strengthened their position and their market share and another report, therefore, would be of benefit and of interest. I find it interesting that on these amendments the Minister seems to be coming back to me on why he disagrees with the things that are suggested to be looked at in the report. That is completely fair enough and it is his prerogative to have an opinion on the matter. The point, however, is that this amendment is talking about having a report on and taking a look at this. That technical report happened a number of years ago but I do not see how such a further report would not be of benefit now as things have changed, as we have seen, in the banking market. It can only be of benefit then to take a look at that.Then we could have a debate on the report or take a look at what it says and see what point of view comes out of that.	spk_161

I regularly have people come to me - friends, family, neighbours etc. - who are struggling or unable to pay their rents. These are people my age who may be looking to start a family and who have to move back to the family home because they simply cannot pay their rent or, if they can, they certainly are not able to save for a mortgage to be able to move out of their rented, shared, overcrowded accommodation. However, it is not only my age group that is suffering like this. I am becoming increasingly aware of older people hitting their pension age or already in their pension age who find it increasingly difficult to pay their rent, who are increasingly concerned their rent will increase and that they will no longer be able to pay it and who do not know what alternative they will have if that happens. These people will have either to move in with their children or to go looking for alternative accommodation, knowing that in the likes of Galway city, where I am from, that accommodation will be very hard found and, if it is found, will be at an extremely high price. Galway city has extortionate rents, which is not often mentioned when a lot of the conversation is about Dublin. However, this is no longer only a city-based issue. We have seen increasingly along our coastal regions that people over the lockdowns, when they were able to work from home, moved back home or moved to more rural areas and to areas along the coastlines. We have seen huge increases in that regard. I have seen increasingly people come to me saying they can no longer rent in the area they have long lived in in rural or coastal communities because these increases are just continuing and they are no longer able to afford them. At this stage the rental crisis is affecting so many different age groups, people and communities. What people now need, and what they have needed for a very long time and can wait for no longer, is urgent action by the Government in this regard. What we clearly need is a ban on rent increases. We have been saying that for a very long time, and the Government really needs to act in that regard. Reference was made earlier to the legislation that pegged rent increases to inflation. The Minister himself has often said he was aware inflation would rise. It is just unfortunate the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, did not seem to realise that would happen. That was clearly a massive mistake by the Government. The reality is these kinds of mistakes hurt people and make their lives more difficult. This amendment seeks just a report. I do not see any reason the Government cannot accept it. The report would examine the social and economic impact of these measures. We know that what has been happening up to now is not working so we need the Government to do something urgently that will work to protect and help renters. The Government could certainly look at doing a report to help renters, who are struggling so much.	spk_482
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-12-01	dail	33	Finance Bill 2021: Report Stage	dbsect_28	I must say that when the Minister got up to speak earlier, I thought I was in some kind of alternate reality or universe, whereby we, in Sinn Féin have been in government for the past years, when he said that the thing we need to do is to build homes. That is something that we have long been calling for. However, it has been the Minister and his party who have been in government and have overseen this housing crisis and the increase in homelessness and the absolute desperation of people trying to pay rents and find places to live. The Minister mentioned HAP.Does the Minister know how many properties were available in Galway city under the housing assistance payment, HAP, limits in October of this year? It was one. That is what the Government is saying to people. That is the reality for people in Galway city. That is the reality for people across the State. This is because of the Government's policies; it is not because of Sinn Féin policies. It would be wise for the Minister to actually listen to our policies and maybe enact some of them to try to help those who are struggling. I absolutely believe our policies will be of benefit to ordinary people who are struggling to pay the rents, who are struggling in overcrowded conditions because they cannot pay their rent, and who are struggling living at home with their parents. The Minister might say he hears all of this in his own clinics, and I am sure he hears about these realities in his own clinics because this is the reality for so many people. The Minister would do well to listen to what these people have to say and ensure his Government enacts policies to help these people. They simply cannot continue the way they are going.	spk_486

Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-11-10	dail	33	Finance (European Stability Mechanism and Single Resolution Fund) Bill 2021 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_20	"This is a highly technical Bill but it provides two main reforms, which I will deal with in moment. First, it is worth providing some background context on what the ESM is, what its forerunner was and what Ireland's previous experience with it was. While most ordinary people are probably not familiar with the ESM, they will surely be aware of what transpired and led us to requesting financial assistance from its forerunner, the European Financial Stability Facility. That was in 2010, a year when multiple Fianna Fáil Ministers told us there was to be no bailout. I recall the then Minister, Mary Hanafin, saying we were fortunate here to have such a good banking sector. It was a time when our former financial regulator told us our banks were well capitalised, only for the Government, before the close of the year, to turn around and go cap in hand to the IMF and EU seeking money for a bailout of the banks. The money we received was to be the first package organised by the European Financial Stability Facility. We received a package of almost €5 billion, financed by a combination of the EU and the IMF. The first tranche of these funds was to be disbursed on 1 February 2011 when we would receive €3.6 billion. In order to receive this money, this State had to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the troika, which would lead to harsh, long-lasting and far-reaching austerity measures being imposed on some of the most vulnerable people in this State. It led to a mass exodus of many of our young people, some of whom never returned home. It also led to the sale of valuable State assets at knockdown prices, representing poor value for money, and has set back the process of economic recovery, as the European Commission now recognises. The European Stability Mechanism, in its current incarnation, is similar to the European fiscal rules in that it is regressive. It is neoliberal in orientation and reflects the kind of erroneous, neoclassical economic thinking which has often pervaded in the EU institutions. However, in saying that, I recognise some of the reforms the Bill is trying to enact and they are an improvement on what is currently in place. The Bill's primary purpose is to ratify amending agreements to both the European Stability Mechanism treaty and the Single Resolution Fund intergovernmental agreement. The Single Resolution Fund was established on 1 January 2016 as an emergency fund for resolving failing banks in the context of the banking union. It is financed by commercial banks in member states which participate in the banking union and thus offers some protections against taxpayer bailouts. The amendment before us seeks to create a line of credit between the ESM and SRF, a so-called common backstop, and this would be used under a scenario in which other options had been exhausted. It is welcome on the basis it goes some way to breaking the sovereign bank link or what is often referred to as the ""doom loop"". Another welcome reform relates to the credit lines the ESM can access. I am, of course, referring to the precautionary conditioned credit line. Member states will not be required to submit a memorandum of understanding. Rather, they will submit a letter of intent outlining their policy intentions, which will then be assessed. Provided this new process is in good faith and member states will not be sent away until they come up with the reforms the EU wishes, this will be an improvement on the  One criticism which needs to be made, and which echoes the current problems with the fiscal rules, relates to the debt-to-GDP ratio criteria. The 60% debt-to-GDP ratio is unworkable. If a eurozone member found itself in difficulty tomorrow and tried to access this line of credit, the current debt-to-GDP ratio would preclude Germany, Austria, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Cyprus, Spain, Belgium, France and, of course, this country. Compounding this ridiculousness is the fact that where the fiscal rules are concerned, it seems likely there will be a significant upward revision of this ratio. The ESM criteria need to also recognise this. I will mention the other line of credit member states can access through the ESM, namely, the line of credit for those countries which do not meet the criteria of the PCCL. This is known as the enhanced conditions credit line. A memorandum of understanding will still be required for this. For the connected financial assistance, the sale of public assets can be attached as a conditionality. This should be removed because, as we know, during such fire sales of state assets, good value for money is rarely had."	spk_287
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-11-09	dail	33	National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) Act 2019: Motion	dbsect_16	Given the exceptional circumstances in which we find ourselves arising from the Covid pandemic, as my colleague, Deputy Doherty, outlined, Sinn Féin will be supporting the motion. A large volume of public expenditure was required to ameliorate the impact of Covid-19 and this was necessary to prevent the worst. This means that the €500 million annual contribution for transfer from the Exchequer to the national surplus reserve fund, or the so-called rainy day fund, to be made this year will place an unnecessary burden on the public finances and as per section 6(1) of the Act the Minister for Finance is allowed to make this proposal to avoid making the annual €500 million contribution into the national reserve fund. The Minister for Finance is right to do that. It is obvious that it would be inappropriate and irresponsible to divert badly needed resources away from fighting the pandemic and it would be a needless risk to do such a thing, especially when case numbers are rising in our hospitals and when our public services are under huge pressure. It is worth mentioning that when this so called rainy day fund came into existence Sinn Féin voiced concerns on it. When it was proposed and introduced in 2019 my party submitted amendments so that the fund could be used for the purposes of investing in housing, infrastructure and climate actions. At that time our amendments were either ruled out of order or opposed. It is said that hindsight is 20/20 but it should be obvious that the then Government was wrong to do that at the time. The housing crisis has become worse, our public infrastructure has fallen further into disrepair and our climate targets seem further out of reach. We were so vulnerable going into this pandemic because of our infrastructural deficit which is due to years of underinvestment. The Government's national development plan clearly acknowledges that we need to make a massive infrastructural investment, particularly in the area of green investment. From our current vantage point it seems that these funds should be allowed to be used for these purposes. When this legislation was introduced the then Government also allowed the fund to be used for the purpose of a capital injection into the banking sector, something we found objectionable. Given the amount of losses the banks could carry forward, meaning they would be paying tax for decades, this seemed like a poor use of funds. Moreover we are seeing an exodus of banks and the Government continues to sit on its hands in this regard. We know the rainy day fund is empty. The money that had been transferred to it from the ISIF had been spent fighting the pandemic but it was not applicable for the other crises we face. Our housing is in a worse state than it was when the fund was set up, we have longer waiting lists and in recent weeks we have seen over 700 people on trolleys in our hospitals in the western region after the Government told us time and again last year that it was putting huge investment into our hospitals. What has changed for those people who see family members lying on trolleys night after night and day after day? We need to make a serious investment if we want to reach our climate targets. That means we need investment in our public infrastructure and that we cannot continue in a situation whereby the Government is cutting the number of buses. We need more buses and more public infrastructure. People are struggling to buy a house or to cover the cost of rent and thousands are languishing on waiting lists. It seems that for those people when it rains it pours but it has been pouring for a hell of a long time and it continues to do so. We need to ensure that the necessary investment is made in all aspects of our infrastructure.	spk_224

Ní féidir gan na torthaí den treocht seo a fheiceáil nuair a bhreathnaítear ar staid na mbóithre i gConamara. Tá an R366 ó dheas agus an N59 ó thuaidh an-dainséarach ar fad. Ní féidir le daoine rothaíocht nó siúl orthu go sábhailte agus bíonn timpistí orthu go minic. Tá grúpa ar an gCeathrú Rua ag impí ar an Stát ar feadh blianta le haghaidh maoiniú do chosáin agus do chúram ar bhóthar Dhoire Fhatharta agus tá siad ag fanacht go fóill. D’ardaigh mé féin bóthar Chuan na Loinge i gceantar na noileán anuraidh. Bhí an bóthar ag cur bac ar dhaoine dul chuig an obair agus ar scoil mar go bhfuil sé faoi uisce chomh minic sin. Tá muintir Ros Muc an-bhuartha go mbeidh drochthimpiste ar an mbóthar mar gheall ar na poill mhóir atá ann, agus nach bhfuil cosain ná soilse air. Tá go leor samplaí eile fud fad Chonamara. We also see this lack of investment in other aspects of daily life in rural Ireland. The 20-X20 bus route has not been reinstated, even though thousands of people in rural towns and villages relied on it. Earlier this year, the 51 bus route was cut back severely, leaving passengers with no evening service after 5 p.m. Fortunately, after intense criticism, that decision was rolled back, but only slightly. Rather than fully reinstating the service, with one bus leaving every hour until 8 p.m., there is now only a 7.05 p.m. service. Even before these cuts were made, rural Ireland needed more public transport links, not fewer. The NDP also failed to commit to a western rail corridor, something that is desperately needed to build connectivity between communities in the west. It seems we all share a vision of an Ireland with less reliance on personal motor vehicles but that vision will not be realised without policy and funding. I want to raise another piece of infrastructure that is central to the success of coastal areas like my constituency, namely, piers. For communities that are built around the sea, including many parts of Connemara and, in particular, our offshore islands, a safe and functional pier is vital. I encourage the Minister to support the motion.	spk_239

It is considered one of the pillars of democratic society and security in Europe, yet when it comes to the persecution of journalist Julian Assange our Government's and the European Council's silence is deafening. He is still incarcerated in Belmarsh prison. He has been incarcerated for years and we know he is in very ill health. It is generally accepted that if he is extradited to the United States he could face up to 170 years in prison. The National Union of Journalists, NUJ, has made its concerns very clear about this. It states:If this extradition is allowed, it will send a clear signal that journalists and publishers are at risk whenever their work discomforts the United States government. Media freedom the world over will take a significant backward step if Julian Assange is forced to face these charges at the behest of a US president.We are told he will be treated humanely if he is extradited, but as his barrister, Edward Fitzgerald, recently reminded us, revelations have shown that the CIA had made serious plans to kidnap and even assassinate him. I ask the Minister of State to take the next opportunity he has to raise this at European Council level. The European Council should speak out strongly on this. For those who do not know much about Julian Assange, his crime is that he exposed war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq. I have raised this matter in the House several times previously and I have raised the use of Shannon Airport for wars in the Middle East and the damage that has done. Why not begin undoing that damage by speaking up for this man and by giving protection to whistleblowers?	spk_290
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-11-03	dail	33	Finance Bill 2021: Second Stage	dbsect_17	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle agus leis an Aire as an mBille seo a chur faoi bhráid na Dála. Ar ndóigh táimid anseo chun plé a dhéanamh ar Bhille Airgeadais 2021 de chuid an Rialtais agus is mór an trua é, i ndáiríre, nach bhfuil fís ann nó nach bhfuil sé ag déanamh tada do ghnáthdhaoine atá ag streachailt lá i ndiaidh lae ag iarraidh a gcuid billí a íoc ach, ar an taobh eile de, tá sé ag cabhrú leo siúd a bhfuil an t-airgead acu cheana féin. We are here to discuss the Bill, which outlines the taxation measures arising from budget 2022. In some ways, it is a surprise that we are already back dealing with the Finance Bill. The past year seems to have gone by very quickly. The Bill includes measures arising from the transposition of the EU anti-tax avoidance directive. Some of these measures were delayed in the Finance Act 2020 and previous Finance Acts. A glaring example of that is the interest rate limitation. Nevertheless, I wish to speak on some of the more pertinent issues as they apply to ordinary people and I will also touch on other measures that are absent from the Bill. I will try to do so by discussing these measures in the context of housing, the cost of living and the business environment. As the Minister is aware, housing continues to be the issue of our day. It is the issue that never goes stale - the problems are simply fresher than ever. This budget is just a continuation of the kinds of measures that helped to bring us to this point. What is included? There is an extension of the help-to-buy scheme. This scheme was criticised by the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, while he was in opposition as being inflationary in terms of housing prices. The reality is that he was not alone in holding that view; it was also the view of the Economic and Social Research Institute, the Parliamentary Budget Office and the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council. The scheme has proven to be inflationary but it is still with us and I do not understand why that is the case. I suppose that, like the shared equity scheme, it suits some people but really negatively impacts the majority. As regards landlords, section 16 amends section 97A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to extend until the end of 2024 the provision which allows tax relief for landlords for pre-letting expenses in the case of properties that have been vacant for a period of 12 months before they are first let. If renters were surveyed and asked what they most wanted to see in budget 2022, a tax break for landlords would probably not have been high on their list of priorities.They are struggling week after week and month after month to pay their rents. In our clinics, and I am sure it is the same for the Minister, we often hear tenants saying that they are being evicted because of the supposed desire of the landlord to sell the property. Often, we hear that some minor renovations are done and then the property is rented out again at a much higher rate. Landlords can claim deductions against rental income from the expenses that are incurred. Therefore, in a way, the Minister has created a perverse incentive for them to do this, if they think they can get away with it. Unfortunately, the reality is that sometimes they do. I am not saying that it is always the case, but the reality is that it does happen. To be clear, Sinn Féin would not have implemented this measure. Some of the large landlords have done well over the last few years, particularly when we consider that we have the highest rents in Europe. We would have introduced a refundable tax credit for renters equivalent to one month's rent and banned rent increases for a period of three years, effectively reducing rents and then freezing them. At least the Minister warned us in relation to what we all knew was going to happen, namely, that there was going to be a rise in inflation. The European Central Bank had stated that when things opened up there was going to be a rise in inflation. I think it is a bit of a pity that the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, did not appear to be aware of this. It must not have come up at Cabinet , as he introduced rent control measures linked to the harmonised indices of consumer prices. Now, it looks like he will be amending that again, as it should have been. What we need to do is to freeze and reduce rents. Section 77 of the Bill introduces the new residential zoned land tax. It will apply to land which is serviced and zoned for residential development in circumstances where the land has not been used for the development of housing. The new tax will apply to the market value of the zoned residential land at an initial rate of 3%. Remarkably, that is lower than the vacant site levy, which is set at 7%. I welcome that Revenue will now be collecting this tax rather than the councils; it is something that we have long been advocating for. Like the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am from Galway city. If the Minister were to go to Galway city, he would see how plagued we are with vacant sites. What we need is strong action. The fact remains that the Minister intends to have a two-year lead time, and the new tax will apply in 2024 where the residential land is zoned after 2022. That is unbelievable. The reality is that the can is being kicked down the road. We have a housing crisis and a vacant site crisis, which must be dealt with immediately. I also note that the new tax will be paid on a self-assessment basis. The valuation date for the purposes of establishing the market value will be 1 February for the relevant year. There is a requirement to revalue the land for each successive three-year period thereafter. Price inflation for residential zoned land is running at around 4% this year. The Minister has set the tax rate below the rate of inflation and once a landowner makes a self-assessment of the value, he or she does not have to do so again for another three years. I think that is beyond the realm of the ridiculous. Of course, there are no measures included in the Bill to stop the financialisation of housing. We would end the great sell-off by ending the tax advantages which have been given to investment funds against the interests of hard-pressed renters and home buyers. We would apply the full rate of capital gains tax on the disposal of property by investment funds, apply a 17% stamp duty surcharge on the purchase of all homes, including apartments, by investment funds, and increase the rate of dividend withholding tax on property investment funds to 33%. The reality is that while this Government remains in place, a house will not be a home, it will be an asset class - something for speculation, concerned with yields, dividends and capital appreciation. With regard to the cost of living, we have seen energy prices continue to spike. We know, from the CSO, that energy prices rose by 22% in the 12-month period to September 2021. Electricity prices rose by 21%, gas prices rose by 14% and the price of home heating oil went up by 46%. The carbon tax has also been hiked further. Let us hope that there are no blackouts this winter because of all the data centres that have been built over the last few years. We need to help reduce energy prices, not increase them. There should have been no hike in carbon tax by the Government in the budget, because the reality is that many people are struggling to pay at this moment in time and they are going to struggle even further. In respect of the business environment, I note there is an income tax break in the Bill for foreign aviation staff, so long as the company they work for has a place of management here, which is good news for these workers because, of course, there was not much joy for domestic aviation workers during the pandemic. With regard to the bank levy, I note that section 57 of the new Bill will result a reduction in revenues. What seems to be the case is that the Minister is reducing revenues by exempting KBC Bank Ireland and Ulster Bank from the levy, as they are now heading for the exit. Why he is doing this is, frankly, beyond me. These banks have enjoyed an oligopolistic market with little competition and now they are exempted from this levy. That is like a nice parting gift for them. I am looking forward to Committee Stage. It is quite an interesting time. There will be some issues that I look forward to teasing out with the Minister. I note that the Bill contains a provision for a 50% relief in excise duty for non-EU small breweries. That amounts to a tax break for non-EU producers of alcohol. We know that Irish small breweries tend to be more labour-intensive than their large multinational competitors. I would be interested to tease out why the Minister is extending this tax break to their non-EU competitors. Will it not harm the domestic industry, while also increasing tax foregone? Chun é seo a chríochnú, is mór an trua é nach bhfuil fís níos fearr sa Bhille seo do ghnáthdhaoine. I do not think it will deliver the transformative change that we need. I think it is largely business as usual, but I look forward to Committee Stage, to going through all the different amendments that will be brought and to have a proper discussion and engagement on it.	spk_338

It is very important we have an overarching autism strategy that brings all the different services and supports under the one umbrella to ensure that children and adults get the supports they need. I know the Minister of State is very much aware of this, but I question how many times we have to bring forward motions, Bills and discussions before we see this kind of overarching strategy that we all agree needs to happen. My colleague, Deputy Funchion, brought forward the autism strategy, which had cross-party support but, unfortunately, we are here again today without it being pushed forward. Deputy Funchion also brought forward previously the need for a committee that ensures such a strategy is delivered upon and holds people to account to ensure they fulfil their responsibilities in this regard. We have all heard of the distress of families who say that time and again their family members simply do not receive the support they need and deserve. I might speak to the Minister of State about one issue that has been raised with me recently by a particular constituent about a new children's disability network team that is supposed to be based in the Renmore area, who was told it would be in place by July this year. I contacted the HSE regarding it and I was told that, at this time, it was not possible to provide an estimated wait time and the children's disability network team would be in contact with the family in due course. This particular family has not heard from it since. This has been going on since July so they are very concerned. I have followed up with the HSE since then but there has been no further update. This particular child is waiting for these services since he or she was 11 years old and was referred for services in 2016. That is nearly half this child's lifetime that he or she has been waiting for support. It is important we make plans to provide services, but what people really need is follow-through and that these services are made accessible to those who need them.	spk_26

This place does nothing for renters, be they students, families or pensioners. The Minister told us not to judge him hastily. He told us to be patient.

It is hard to tell when exactly Eoghan Murphy's term as Minister's ended and the present Minister's one began because there is no difference.

We saw during the course of the pandemic that the cost of properties across these areas increased massively. Just this week a woman come into my office who lives in a coastal area. She said her landlord is looking to increase her rent by 35%.

Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-10-12	dail	33	Budget Statement 2022	dbsect_4	"Politics is about choices and rarely is that clearer than on budget day. A Government's budget is a fiscal expression of its policy priorities. Does it tackle sky-high rents? Does it tackle unaffordable childcare or a health system bursting at its seams? It does not. The crises we face in each of those areas did not come about through some act of God. They were the direct results of political decisions made by the men seated across from me in this Chamber and by their Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Green Party predecessors. A budget delivers on a Government's priorities and the interests it serves. Does it deliver for the young worker trying to pay extortionate rents on a meagre wage, the family desperately trying to pay their childcare fees, the couple living in their parents' box room, waiting for their lives to start while they scrimp and save, and watch in despair as house prices inflate beyond reach? What about the elderly woman living alone and trying to heat her home while anxiously watching the energy bills go up and up? What about the man lying in agony on a trolley in a hospital corridor while exhausted nurses tell him they are sorry but he still cannot be seen? What about the 65-year-old who has worked all her life and wants to retire but is forced to keep working long, tiring shifts on her feet all day? I cannot remember a Government led by either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael ever delivering on affordable housing, accessible childcare, a fair day's pay for a day's work, a national health system or, indeed, a sustainable environment. For too long, this Government's priorities have been the priorities of the well-heeled special interests, the vested interests who pull the strings, including the vulture funds whose interests are served by ever-increasing rents, the large private developers whose interests are served by ever-increasing property prices, the private health insurance industry whose interests are served by stymying the roll-out of a national health system, and the data centre lobby whose interests are served by generous capital allowances which allow them to write off much of their construction costs while the cost of heating our homes increases. They are the insiders who are always taken care of by this Government while ordinary families and workers are pushed to the back of the queue. Let us be clear: the crises we are facing in all of these areas are a direct result of Government policy. The good news is that what has been done by the Government can be undone. It can be undone by a very different type of government, one with a very different set of policy priorities; a government which delivers for communities, families and workers, puts ordinary people first and stands up for them; a government for change. We in Sinn Féin stand ready to form such a government. Until we have a government that is prepared to do just that, politics in this State will merely be the shadow cast upon society by big business. Bíonn roghanna le déanamh ag na hAirí chuile lá beo sa Teach seo ag a mbíonn tionchar nach beag acu ar dhaoine. Tá rogha acu seasamh le gnáth-theaghlaigh agus leis an gcosmhuintir, le daoine atá thíos ag costais mhaireachtála, leo siúd atá ag íoc cíosanna ró-arda sna cathracha nó nach bhfuil in ann na táillí ollmhóra do chúram leanaí a chlúdach, agus le muintir na tuaithe a bhíonn fágtha ar an trá fholamh go mion-minic mar gheall ar easpa seirbhísí, easpa infreastruchtúr agus easpa deiseanna fostaíochta. Nó, mar atá déanta ag rialtas i ndiaidh rialtais cheana, is féidir leis na hAirí seasamh leis na baincéirí, na creach-chistí agus na forbróirí móra. Is mór an trua gur shocraigh siad cloí leis an tsean-pholaitíocht agus gan tabhairt faoi na géarchéimeanna éagsúla atá an goilleadh ar an bpobal. Tá bealach eile ann. Tá slí ann sochaí níos cothroime a chinntiú dár bpobal agus tá muidne sásta na hathruithe sin a chur i bhfeidhm. Bheadh Rialtas faoi stiúir Shinn Féin in ann stíleanna polaitíochta sa Stát a athrú ó bhun. This year is the tenth anniversary of Fine Gael entering government, so comhghairdeas libh. Not only that, it is a sixth housing budget jointly delivered by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, so comhghairdeas libh beirt. They have somehow managed to push house prices back towards 2007 levels and out of the reach of many. Our renters pay the highest rents in Europe. They have also presided over the largest increase in homelessness in the history of this State, and not only that, they have helped to create new situations that put people at risk of homelessness. I am talking about the workers whose wages have not kept up with the cost of rent, students who cannot find somewhere to stay, and pensioners on fixed incomes whose landlord is selling up and who cannot find somewhere they can afford. This economic insecurity has bred misery for many, and misery breeds anxiety and mental health changes. The housing and mental health crises are joined at the hip. There is no mystery about how this happened. This was not an act of God or the subject of some strange forces; it was the deliberate result of the Government policy. It fashioned a housing model which rests on the three pillars of vulture funds, large private developers and taxpayer subsidies for both. These vulture funds were welcomed with open arms. The former Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, said that such funds played an important role in the ecology by cleaning up dead animals. Is that the Government's view of workers, pensioners and families? To many, that is clearly how it feels. The chief executive of one large vulture fund said rent increases were so dramatic that he truly felt bad for the Irish people. Criticism of the Government's policy has come from across the spectrum and across the world. To the great embarrassment of the Government, even the UN has criticised its favourable treatment of vulture funds. When there is public outcry, what does the Government do? It takes an idea Sinn Féin put forward last year to stop vulture funds bulk-buying homes, but then provided exceptions if properties are leased back to local authorities at crazy costs to taxpayers. That is, of course, a great deal for vulture funds again. While Fine Gael helps with the rents, Fianna Fáil helps with the prices. Meanwhile, the Green Party falls asleep at the wheel. The much-hyped shared equity scheme of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, will further push up prices, as my colleague, Deputy Ó Broin, has pointed out. If it is such a good idea, where did the scheme come from? I did not read it in any Fianna Fáil manifesto. Here is a clue. The two big property lobby groups, one of which happens to involve a former leading member of Fianna Fáil, published shared equity scheme proposals. The light bulb suddenly went off in the Minister's head and he had an idea for a shared equity loan scheme. Who does he think he is kidding? The measures that have been put to us here today are not the radical departure we need. Are they a break from the failed model? A lot of numbers have been bandied about. Every year on budget day it is interesting to hear big numbers that might seem impressive to many people. We must point out that a significant part of the increase has arisen from capital carry-over. That capital carry-over is massive. That is money that was previously available to the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, but which he was unable to spend. That, in effect, is not new money. The Ministers have outlined an extra €468 million for social housing. I wonder how much of that will be capital carry-over. The actual increase in capital spending for housing is approximately €420 million, in comparison with Sinn Féin's proposed additional capital spend on housing of €1.6 billion. The Government is well short of what the likes of the ESRI were calling for. The next thing we need to do is to separate what the Minister is proposing will be built for affordable and social housing and what is just another developer subsidy scheme, because these things work in different ways. The building of social and affordable housing is how we tackle this crisis. These developer-led subsidy schemes at best lock in high prices and at worst push them even higher. The schemes are the shared equity scheme, the help-to-buy scheme and the new Croí Cónaithe fund. When we look at those schemes, it is clear the Government is providing more funding for developers than people trying to gain access to affordable housing. Both Ministers mentioned that housing is the crisis of the time but have done little to address it. Sinn Féin would end the tax breaks for the vulture funds and developers, and deliver genuinely affordable homes for ordinary people to buy. We would ban rent increases and put a month's rent back in people's pockets. We would deliver a functioning vacant site levy immediately and not in a few years' time. We would not delay it and allow more land banking and price increases.Successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments have commercialised, commodified and financialised what should very obviously be a public good. They have turned housing from something which families and workers can call home into something completely different. They have turned it into an asset of speculation for large investment funds, something concerned with the rental yield on assets, capital appreciation and dividends for shareholders. What kind of gross distortion is this that the Government has allowed to try to normalise something so frighteningly abnormal? This pandemic has exposed the cracks in our health system as well as those in housing. It has exposed and exacerbated the cracks in our health system but it did not cause them. Those causes far predate the onset of Covid-19. They were present when Deputy Varadkar was the Minister for Health, when Deputy Harris was the Minister and even when the Taoiseach was. Today, there are more than 900,000 people languishing on waiting lists, almost 100,000 of whom are children. That is simply outrageous. We have all heard stories of people, and especially children, who are languishing on these waiting lists. On this morning's ""Today with Claire Byrne"", we heard about Adam. Children like Adam have been let down time and time again by glossy budget launches which provide photo opportunities and praise for Ministers but which do nothing for the ordinary people being failed utterly by our healthcare system.  Yesterday, there were 477 people on trolleys in our hospitals. According to the INMO, this was the highest number of patients on trolleys since the onset of the pandemic. I recall the Minister shouting loudly last year about all the additional capacity the Government was going to provide for the sector but nothing has changed for ordinary people. Let us be clear, as things are reopening, so too are the old wounds in our health system. These are the results of the failure to ensure that there are enough doctors, nurses and beds. We need to build capacity in our health system and to build a national health system that finally puts an end to the two-tier health approach and which can deliver affordable and accessible health and social care. This Government's budget does not go nearly far enough to address this crisis. It proposes free GP care for children under eight but, as my colleague said, we were expecting universal free GP care by next year. Unfortunately, I will not be able to hold my breath on that one. Despite a few additional ICU beds, there are no additional acute or community care beds over and above what was provided last year while only €311 million is allocated for new measures. We have lengthening waiting lists, crises in our emergency departments and rising trolley counts. There is no vision to make healthcare work and no delivery. There are no additional acute or community beds on top of what was funded and only €250 million to tackle waiting lists. It is simply the same old, same old. A Sinn Féin Government would deliver 932 additional beds comprising inpatient beds, critical care beds, neurorehabilitation beds and special community beds for mental health patients. We would expand theatre capacity, modernise our ehealth system and upgrade and replace equipment. We would also deliver fair pay and allowances for student nurses and midwives. This Dáil voted on a motion, which the Government did not oppose. The fact that the Government has done nothing about it is absolutely shocking. The pandemic has taken many physical tolls on our society and on healthcare but it has also had a significant impact on the mental health of many of our citizens. As a society, we have finally become more open about mental health struggles. It is now time for major investment in this area. If Sinn Féin was in government, we would today be launching the biggest mental health budget in the history in the State. The Minister has outlined an additional spend of €24 million on mental health. We would provide €114 million in additional funding for mental health. We know there has been a rise in eating disorders since the onset of the pandemic. We need an adult eating disorder team in each community healthcare organisation, CHO, area. At the moment, there is only one, in Dublin. That is not good enough. I hope the Minister listens to that point. What our rural communities learned today is that this Government has no plan and no vision. It has no fís d'aon chineál for our family farms. We proposed almost €220 million in funding to provide for our suckler and sheep sectors, supporting smaller and poorer farmers. What the Government has delivered is an accounting exercise, a simple rollover, and no measures that would come close to meeting the needs of a sector in crisis. I have heard many times from both Ministers that tackling the cost of living has been their aim, and the aim of their predecessors, for a long time. We have been hearing this for so long that I genuinely believe the Ministers are trolling us because this State regularly ranks as one of the most expensive places to live in the entire world."	spk_20
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-10-12	dail	33	Budget Statement 2022	dbsect_4	When it comes to addressing some of the most fundamental aspects of the cost of living, the Government's measures seem, at best, ineffective and, at worst, to be exacerbating the problem. This Government is basically telling us that it is sorry but that it cannot deal with housing, healthcare or childcare. It is giving us a couple of quid and suggesting that we all forget about it and move on with our lives. That does not wash with people any more. If the Government cannot tackle the big systemic crises that we face, what, in the name of God, can it do? Let us take childcare for example. It is like a second mortgage for families. The current model has utterly failed families, early childhood educators and crèche owners. One can tinker with it all one likes, but a failed model is a failed model. The Government is providing additional funding of €78 million. This is, of course, welcome. In exchange for extending the universal subsidy to the age of 15, fees are to be frozen, but the fees are to be frozen at already inflated levels. It is not a reduction. This sector has been starved of funding for years. The Government has increased that funding but this will not negate the need for fundamental changes in the sector. It has provided additional funding for wages, which is to be ring-fenced. That is, again, welcome, but no wage scale has been provided. Staff will have to wait to see what kind of increase they will get. I will look with interest at the detail of the Government's announcement and what it will mean for the sector because I am concerned that the devil will be in the detail. While I welcome this element of the budget, it seems more like plans on paper. So many people, particularly women, are locked out of the workforce by the unaffordability of childcare. We need to tackle that. We have a vision for childcare. It is backed up by a detailed plan that would deliver for parents and for those working in the sector. Over the course of two budgets, we would cut the costs for parents by two thirds because that is what is needed.  While many women are locked out of the workplace as a result of the cost of childcare, many who are locked out of third level education will also look on with despair. Since Fine Gael came to power in 2011, it has implemented harsh cuts and commercialised this sector. Not only did it commercialise housing, but it is also doing the same with this sector. It pushed an ever-greater share of the financial burden onto students and parents by doubling fees. While funding levels have been rising incrementally since 2017, this has only barely covered the cost of additional student places. It has again chosen to provide pre-allocated funding, which makes for good soundbites, rather than providing adequate core funding for higher education institutions, which need such funding to deliver for students and wider society.  The Ministers have regularly talked about the need for catching up in primary and secondary education after the impact of Covid but this budget means that many DEIS schools will still not have access to hot meals. There is no additional funding for school completion officers or home-school liaison services. There is nothing of any significance to help secondary schools and the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio is inadequate. There is nothing regarding educational psychologists and no movement on free books, despite this being a commitment in the programme for Government. Our schools will also remain underfunded because there is to be no increase of any scale in capitation grants, which will force schools to ask for voluntary contributions from parents and hungry children. If we are serious about tackling the climate crisis, we need to take radical steps to reduce carbon consumption. That is a fairly straightforward concept but it is not fully understood by this Government. We all know that we have a car culture in this State but, let us be frank, in many areas people are forced to own cars. The two key issues are accessibility and affordability. We need to get people on public transport but how are we to do that in light of those two key issues? Last week, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, suggested that fares would not be reduced for a number of years while today it was announced that they would be halved for those aged 19 to 23.I welcome that as a first step, but it clearly does not go far enough and is not fast enough. We would deliver free public transport for those aged under 18 over the course of two budgets. That is the kind of vision we need. We need to change the culture of the youngest generation and that is where we will start. It is imperative we incentivise the use of public transport to try to tackle transport emissions and instil the habit of using public transport from an early age. What about all of the areas where people have no public transport available to them? I am thinking of those areas between Galway and Dublin on the No. 20 Expressway bus route. The Government is telling the people of rural Ireland to get out of their cars, but is not willing to provide additional public transport. What does it expect of those people? Build it and they will come. We were told that the purpose of carbon tax was to help us reach our climate targets. The latest increase will mean an additional €40 on a fill of oil. Yet, the Government allowed more than 70 data centres to be built. The Taoiseach only recently called for the fast-tracking of more. The average data centre, as we know, uses the same amount of energy as a small city the size of Kilkenny. The Government has allowed the energy equivalent of 70 Kilkennys to be built, which places incredible pressure on the energy grid. Ordinary people have to pick up the cost in terms of rising energy prices. When we hear about energy price inflation, know this: the inflation has largely been imported. The overwhelming majority of the data held by data centres in Ireland is from other jurisdictions. The reason they are here is because when companies build data centres, they can essentially write off much of the cost of construction through generous capital allowances. That is why our budget wants to put a stop to this. The taxpayer is essentially subsidising the cost of construction. Data centres can use up huge amounts of energy which means higher energy costs and that pushes out further our carbon emissions targets. The capital expenditure laid out in the budget pales in comparison with what a Sinn Féin Government would do. Not only do we believe this is appropriate, we think it is absolutely necessary to tackle the scale of the crisis in our public infrastructure. That is by no means a niche view. The IMF and the EU Commission have said in recent times that the poor state of our public infrastructure is an underlying weakness in our economy. As has been outlined, we have signed up to the OECD process which will see our corporation tax rate move to 15% for companies with revenues above €750 million. It was said our 12.5% rate was seen as the cornerstone of our economy and a chief plank in our industrial strategy. It should be clear that to remain competitive, we need to invest. This competitiveness will have to be built on the strength, accessibility and affordability of our education system. It will be built on the skills, talent and hard work of our labour force. It will rest on how affordable, accessible and desirable a place to live this is. It will be dependent on the quality, connectivity and accessibility of our public infrastructure. All of this requires investing for the future in our future. The scale of our capital expenditure needs to be commensurate with the scale of the challenges we face. We believe the Government's budget fails in this respect. The housing crisis will continue to get worse. We will continue to see the construction of office buildings and hotels and very little in terms of affordable and social homes. We have proposed the building of 20,000 affordable and social homes because that is what is needed. With regard to health, Sláintecare is foundering on the rocks with a lack of Government follow-through. More than 900,000 people are languishing on waiting lists. We are calling for significant capital investment and now is absolutely the right time to do it. Investment is something that can create an asset which can generate a return. Public investment creates public assets from which we can all benefit. It is time to invest in our people and-----	spk_21

Just last week, I walked through Galway city centre and took a look at the number of vacant homes. At the same time, thousands of people are on the housing waiting list, thousands of people are paying huge rents and thousands of people are locked out of homeownership. Just this week, we saw the launch of the national development plan. One of its themes is about moving people and seeing populations grow in cities outside of Dublin and in rural areas. However, it has very little on specifics regarding infrastructure, be they roads, the western rail corridor or whatever. On the issue of vacant homes specifically, we cannot continue in Galway city to see these vacant homes and vacant sites lying idle, while so many people are locked out of secure accommodation. Can the Minister commit to stop this?	spk_141

Is é sin an bealach a bhfuil sé faoi láthair agus tá a fhios againn é sin. Ar ndóigh, tuigeann muintir na Gaeltachta é sin go rímhaith. Lig an Stát Gaeilgeoirí agus muintir na Gaeltachta síos ar feadh na nglúnta cheana ó thaobh an ceart a bhí agus atá acu a dteanga dhúchais a úsáid ina Stát féin.

Dá bhrí sin, caithfidh an Rialtas a chinntiú go bhfuil na seirbhísí seo ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht agus tá sé ar an Aire Stáit a dheimhniú go mbeidh an bunleibhéal seo ann chun na seirbhísí seo a chur i bhfeidhm go huile is go hiomlán i nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht. Impím ar an Aire Stáit glacadh leis an leasú seo. Tá sé ríthábhachtach go bhfuil ardchaighdeán Gaeilge ag na hearcaigh sa státseirbhís agus go bhfuil dóthain fostaithe ann chun déileáil leis na daoine atá ag iarraidh seirbhísí Stáit a úsáid trí mheán na Gaeilge. Faoinár leasú, bheadh iallach ar an státseirbhís cloí le leibhéal B1 sa Ghaeilge chun go mbeadh sé ag 20% d’earcaigh nua, ar a laghad. Is rud fíorthábhachtach é seo. Ní hamháin go gcuireadh sé sin le seirbhísí trí Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil do Ghaeilgeoirí ach chruthódh sé deiseanna fostaíochta dóibh agus spreagfadh sé ardchaighdeán Gaeilge i measc an phobail freisin. Má bhreathnaímid air go ginearálta agus má bhreathnaímid ar dhaoine atá agus a mbíonn ag caitheamh lá i ndiaidh lae trí mheán na Gaeilge - cuireann Raidió na Gaeltachta agus TG4 an nuacht agus go leor eile ar fáil trí mheán na Gaeilge - tá sé dochreidte nach bhfuil an bunleibhéal B1 seo riachtanach ionas go mbeadh ardchaighdeán ann. Nílimid ach ag caint ar 20% de na hearcaigh nua ach dhéanfadh sé difríocht ollmhór. Léireodh sé do phobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta agus dóibh siúd atá ag tógáil a gcuid páistí trí mheán na Gaeilge, rud a bhfuilimid ar fad ag iarraidh go dtarlódh sé, go bhfuil an Stát, an Rialtas agus an tAire Stáit dáiríre faoin leibhéal Gaeilge atá ag teastáil ón státseirbhís agus go mbeadh seirbhísí ar fáil trí mheán na Gaeilge do na daoine sin. Is é an rud is tábhachtaí agus an bealach is fearr le cinntiú go leanfaidh daoine orthu ag labhairt Gaeilge lena gcuid páistí agus comhghleacaithe ná go gcaithfidh an Stát a léiriú go bhfuil sé sásta an teanga a úsáid; go gcreideann sé go bhfuil sé fíorthábhachtach go mbeadh an Ghaeilge ann; agus go bhfuil sé ina cheart bunúsach dúinn ar fad a bhfuil Gaeilge againn, agus muintir na Gaeltachta ach go háirithe, an Ghaeilge a úsáid pé uair atáimid ag déileáil leis an Stát.

Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-09-29	dail	33	Data Centre Moratorium: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_7	I commend the Social Democrats on bringing forward this important motion. Today we are the European capital of data centres. In reality, that is a badge of climate dishonour for this State. We are playing host to more than 70 of these centres, with many more under construction or at advanced stages of the planning process. The Taoiseach's recent comments were to the effect that we would look at escalating the planning of these new centres. EirGrid first estimated these data centres would be using 29% of our energy by 2028 but less than a year later the estimation jumped to 31% by one year earlier in 2027. Clearly, reaching climate targets would be fanciful, meaning the cost to our society would be large and we would incur fines. We have already seen increases in our fossil fuel imports to offset the increased energy demand. The CRU has even suggested imposing a moratorium on them because of the risk of blackouts this winter. That seems like the sensible thing to do. Instead, what do we do? We give them capital allowances. In terms of how much tax is foregone, who knows? I asked the Minister for Finance how much tax is foregone in this regard last week and how much this is costing this State. The reply I got was that we do not have that figure. Revenue does not collect that figure. That badly needs to be rectified for environmental reasons and in the interests of transparency and fiscal prudence, to borrow the Government's favourite buzz term. What I find most frustrating about all of this is how the Government continues to talk out of both sides of its mouth. At the start of August the Taoiseach lectured us on how climate change will have increasingly devastating consequences unless we address it. On that, he is right. Then two weeks later, what did he do? He told us he will streamline the planning application process for data centres. Again, he has been talking out of two sides of his mouth. Then, this month he thought he would lecture world leaders on climate change. His apparent lack of self-awareness is frightening. The Taoiseach may as well have been spraying aerosol cans while burning leaves in front of other world leaders because that is how ridiculous this was. We need to take climate action seriously. We need to examine the issue of data centres. We have a sensible motion before us. We would not be the first state to do this. Let us do this. Let us back this motion and start taking the climate crisis seriously.	spk_67

This summer alone, Shannon Airport facilitated the transportation of six UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters through the airport as they returned to the US from the war efforts in Afghanistan. Much of the ammunition, large amounts of weapons, tanks and even fighter aircraft that had previously been transported through Shannon Airport This State has aided and abetted US atrocities for many years. Since 2017, the number of Afghan civilians killed in airstrikes carried out by the US and its allies rose by 330%. Many of these bombs fell on the ordinary Afghan population for whom this Government is now expressing concern. We have also - admittedly, unwittingly - placed deadly weapons in the hands of the Taliban who may, and are likely to, carry out future atrocities against their own citizens. Why was this State, which is supposedly neutral - I agree with Deputy Haughey's earlier comments in this regard - so willing to act as a US accomplice? The Minister is just as aware of the whole issue around Shannon Airport as I am. We should bear in mind that the US offered to pull out of Shannon and Fianna Fáil said ""No"". Not only were other options available to the US, but it had already begun using them. For example, Prestwick, near Glasgow, had been increasingly used by the US military for refuelling purposes in recent years. We also need to think about what the reality of this is for people, including children. Only last week, I read a report in  I raise an issue with the Minister that I have raised previously, namely, the case of Julian Assange. Mr. Assange is due to appear in court on 27 and 28 October. I am aware that the Minister has meetings with people. I ask him to raise-----"	spk_425

The war funnelled trillions of dollars of US taxpayer money directly into the pockets of five big US defence companies that were involved in the US war effort and the atrocities that resulted from it. I will borrow the words of the great historian, Howard Zinn. While written from the perspective of an independent activist, I think they are words that we can all reflect on.It is a world of clashing interests – war against peace, nationalism against internationalism, equality against greed, and democracy against elitism – and it seems to me both impossible and undesirable to be neutral in those conflicts.	spk_427

Tá an-áthas orm labhairt faoin mBille seo. I am delighted to be introducing, alongside my colleague, Deputy Clarke, our Bill. This is the fruit of a year’s work and as today is International Access to Information Day, I feel it is the perfect day to introduce this amending Bill. Since being elected I, alongside my colleague, Deputy Clarke, have been making the case that our freedom of information, FOI, regime is in crisis. This is something that transparency campaigners and investigative journalists have been highlighting for some time. At times it felt as though we were ploughing a lonely furrow and calls for reform were falling on deaf ears. However, recent events brought into sharp focus the crisis we had been describing. To be clear, we knew prior to these events that urgent action was needed. This was as a result of a year's work conducted by Deputy Clarke and I and as a result of a survey we conducted. The Bill seeks to strengthen the Act and I hope we will receive Government support. The Bill would enhance the powers of the Office of the Information Commissioner to allow it to refer complaints under FOI legislation to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, for investigation where it is believed that the relevant person has failed in their obligations under the FOI Act. It would ensure all public bodies established under the Companies Act are immediately brought under the remit of FOI legislation upon establishment. This would prevent bodies, including, for example, the Land Development Agency, being exempt from FOI for the first six months of their existence. That is an important amendment. It would also empower the Minister to conduct an annual review of all bodies to which FOI legislation applies, including any bodies to which a partial exclusion currently applies and whether this is consistent with the Act's principles of oversight, transparency and accountability. This is to ensure that we are adhering to best practice and transparency at all times. It would also bring back information on pension payments related to former taoisigh, Ministers, Presidents and office holders within the remit of the FOI legislation. I am delighted to move this Bill, alongside my colleague, Deputy Clarke.	spk_123

The Minister of State did not really answer my question on whether there were purchases that we are not aware of. He said 80% of the equipment was to standard but that still implies a significant risk. I am aware that we went outside the normal competitive process and used negotiated procedure but there were clearly huge risks and issues over substandard or totally faulty equipment. A recent study by the World Bank ranked countries' approaches to procurement across a range of factors, including regulation. We did not score well in that regard; in fact, we scored quite poorly. I am interested in having an answer to my first question. Second, what does the reform board plan to do in respect of regulation?	spk_23

I also acknowledge the Government is not opposing it. We have a very significant affordability issue. This is something we are all aware of and sometimes, you feel as though you are repeating yourself, but things are not changing in this regard. In the past few days, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, published its residential property price index for July 2021. Houses in the west of Ireland have increased by 9.1% year-on-year. Things are not changing. While we may know there is a huge affordability crisis, nothing is changing in this regard. Moreover, apartments outside of Dublin have increased in price by 14.6%. Just outside my estate of Mervue in Galway city, there is an apartment block with more than 300 apartments being built to rent. Locals are absolutely outraged by this. They feel that they, their children and grandchildren will never be able to afford to live in Galway city in the Mervue area. They are also very concerned about the impact that this is having in building communities. Mervue is a proud community and there is a traditionally strong community spirit in that area. They feel that this build-to-rent project with which they are not pleased is going against this community spirit, as well as continuing to lock their children and grandchildren out of homeownership. The fact of unaffordability in Galway city has reached a complete crisis point. We know that the HAP limits are far too low to be able to rent in Galway city. Just today, a person who approached my office said he cannot get a place within HAP limits in Galway city, he cannot drive and has health issues and as a result, he has had to go into homeless accommodation. This is not something that is unusual and is not a once-off but is a reality for people in Galway city.	spk_178

Since this Government began its life, we have seen the complete erosion of public confidence in political life. It is undeniable at this point that we have a crisis in how this Government does business. Public standards and ethics are on the floor. We previously had a clear attempt to breach the lobbying Act, which tries to close the revolving door between government and vested interests. The events of today have been dictated by Zapponegate, another occasion when public standards and ethics were thrown into the bin. We then had the Minister, Deputy Coveney, appear before a committee where he provided an account that contained serious inconsistencies and excuses designed to try to explain away the problem. We also heard the Minister stating, by his own admission, that he had deleted official correspondence related to this matter. I am no legal expert, but section 52 of the Freedom of Information Act is written with the kind of admirable clarity that does not require a legal background to understand. It states that ""a person ... without lawful excuse and with intention to deceive destroys or materially alters a record shall be guilty of an offence and be liable on summary conviction to a class B fine"". I guess we will just have to let the public decide for themselves because the Government's vote of confidence would seem to suggest it does not believe there is any issue. We then heard that this Government does not even seem to believe that Katherine Zappone's actions constitute lobbying at all. To hear Ministers say they are not being lobbied when they receive numerous texts and communications from a former Cabinet colleague about a role that was created for her, the mind absolutely boggles. It would appear that some Ministers simply believe they are doubling as HR specialists in their spare time. I heard one Fine Gael Minister play the definitional game by trying to define the problem away, and that is the height of cynicism. Yes, we could restrict the definition of lobbying to someone who conducts their canvassing activities in a hotel lobby, but where would that get us? Call me old-fashioned, but I have always subscribed to the belief that if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it is a duck. The same goes for lobbying. I have heard some people tonight say that members of the Opposition are just standing on the sidelines, but we are being extremely constructive and the lobbying Act clearly needs to be strengthened. I have a Bill to do that and what did members of the Government do? They kicked the can down the road. The FOI Act clearly needs strengthening, and what have I received just a few moments ago but another delaying tactic - a review. We do not need another review; we need action. Tá daoine bréan den chineál bhealach is atá ag an Rialtas seo chun a chuid oibre a dhéanamh agus tuigim go maith an fáth a bhfuil siad bréan de.

If the events of tonight have taught us anything, it is that we clearly need to restore public confidence in political life and that we need robust procedures to ensure public accountability and absolute transparency. The debate we had earlier is a perfect example as to why we need to enhance our freedom of information, FOI, regime. The reality is that in this State for most of its history there have been very significant concerns as to transparency and access to records and data. Some would tell us this was all in the past and ancient history, so to speak. Let me remind those people that this time last year the Government was attempting to lock away for 30 years records involved in the mother and baby homes scandal. It seems ancient history continues to manifest itself in contemporary policy, and that is precisely why the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act in 1997 was such an important moment and was, indeed, a watershed one. It was one of the first big steps in transparency to give our citizens three new legal rights. These were, first, the right to consult official records, excluding those relating to internal security and foreign relations; second, the right to update and correct personal information that was inaccurate; and third, the right to be given reasons public decisions are made when they affect the person in question. Freedom of information has been essential for journalists, political researchers, concerned citizens, NGOs, historians and victims of State abuse. It has been a means to get access to information on politicians’ expenses and to gain access to reports on scandals in our nursing homes, hospitals and industrial schools. It has played very significant roles in sagas that have been detrimental to this State. Many transparency campaigners and journalists have been saying for a very long time that they have very significant concerns as to the ability of the FOI Act at this time. John Devitt from Transparency Ireland said it played an essential role in underpinning our faith in public affairs but that it has been deliberately diluted in recent years. That is its importance here in that it has an essential role in underpinning our faith in public affairs. This time last year I began researching the problems that currently exist in our FOI regime because not only were we hearing it from the transparency campaigners and journalists but so many other people were coming to me on this issue. It was because of those concerns that I conducted a survey with those who often and regularly use the freedom of information mechanism. The results were absolutely damning. Any of us who has tried to use the freedom of information regime can very much relate to what these results say.What we saw was that almost 80% felt that the regime was performing poorly or very poorly and 86% said it had seriously declined in recent years. I raised this with the Minister repeatedly but his response in June was that the regime was ""robust and functioning well"" - famous last words because the events of Zapponegate, or whatever you want to call it, soon overtook matters and have raised serious concerns about adherence to FOI and the importance attached to the FOI regime within the Government. Those events really show the attitude towards the FOI regime and the fact that it needs to be strengthened. We know that deleting official correspondence is a clear offence under the Act, but this seems to be disregarded again. Public bodies were claiming that correspondence did not exist only to show later that it did. This is nothing new, however. Anyone who has been using FOI can tell you that this happens regularly. We know from Right to Know that Ken Foxe has said we have public bodies failing to meet their obligations time and time again, and it is the same organisations year after year. They seek time extensions for routine requests, do not bother answering requests, refuse access to everything and fail to find records that are later shown to have existed. Some of this may be cultural or educational, and some are resource-based and cannot be tackled through legislation, but many of the current weaknesses of our FOI regime can be tackled through legislation: the lack of accountability for those who fail to fulfil their obligations under the Act; the failure to bring new public bodies immediately within the scope of the Act; the failure to extend the remit of the Act more fully to certain public bodies that are only partially covered; and the refusal to grant information on the pensions of retired Taoisigh, Tánaistí agus Airí, which once was available. The Act has, in addition, a lot of shortcomings. For this reason my colleague, Deputy Clarke, and I felt that urgent action was needed. That is why we drafted our forthcoming FOI (amendment) Bill, much of which is included in tonight's motion. To be clear, this is not something we have conjured up in the past few days; it is something we have been working on consistently over the past year. We need urgent action. I have seen the amendment the Government has proposed. We do not need more reviews and delays. What we need is action. I hope this second legislative attempt by me to increase transparency and accountability will not be pushed down the road like the Regulation of Lobbying Act, which we also need to see implemented. We were told the Government would create its own Bill in the intervening period but, thankfully, now we can deal with this Bill and it can move to Committee Stage. I often hear and heard again tonight - and it does my head in, for want of a better term - Government party spokespeople say the Opposition should offer solutions. Well, here I am. Here we are. We are offering solutions and I have been here before offering solutions. We are seeing delay after delay by the Government. It wants us to offer solutions. We are doing so. This motion would deal with some of the very real issues we need sorted. First, with the admission by a Government Minister in recent weeks that he deleted text messages, we very clearly need to establish procedures in order that each Department ensures that Ministers no longer destroy records that should be maintained by the Department. Second, either FOI does not seem to be taken seriously by the Government or it is not aware of its duties. The Government must therefore ensure that all Ministers are aware of their responsibilities under FOI and that all documents are made available. Crucially, we need to enhance the powers of the Information Commissioner to allow the commissioner to refer complaints under FOI legislation to SIPO for investigation. If there is a concern that a public body or a Minister or relevant person has intentionally or recklessly failed to fulfil their obligations, there needs to be consequences. It has been said that democracy dies in darkness. An FOI request is a way to shine the light into the darkest corners of our political systems. It is time to recharge the batteries of FOI. I implore the Minister to support the motion."	spk_320

We know from the conversations and speeches tonight and from long before this evening that this regime is in crisis. This is not new. Transparency campaigners have been saying this for a long time. All of us here who have tried to get information through the FOI regime will understand the frustration of those transparency advocates who have told us time and again that this is in crisis.We should not be fooled in this regard. It was very clear today and over the past number of weeks that Ministers either do not have a clue what they are supposed to do in regard to the freedom of information process or they are simply ignoring it and do not think it is that important. As was said several times tonight, the FOI system really is a cornerstone of democracy. This is not an issue of Government versus Opposition; it is, simply put, a democratic issue and it needs to be dealt with at this stage. As I said earlier, I have raised this issue with the Minister in the past and he has said previously that he considers the system to be robust. I take his point that he announced in June that he will undertake a review. However, that is not good enough. We do not need a review. What we need now is action, not another review. Some days ago, I heard the Tánaiste speaking on radio and it was clear that even he is not aware this review is taking place. What we have heard tonight and in recent weeks, as well as the fact Ministers are not aware that a review is taking place, shows the FOI regime is not being taken seriously enough and people simply do not seem to care about its importance. The Minister's amendment states that there should be a review etc., but my view is that we have gone beyond a review. We need only look to what has been said tonight and the fact we have Ministers claiming they did not know they should not delete text messages that relate to Government business. That shows we need more than a review. What is needed is action and what is being proposed is not good enough. The Sinn Féin Bill is not something that was just drafted at the last minute. We have worked on it for some time. This motion deals with much of what is covered in the Bill. Why will the Minister not enact the motion and ensure the Information Commissioner is able to refer complaints, under the FOI legislation, to SIPO? Surely that is of benefit to everyone in this Chamber. Why not ensure that when public bodies are established under the Companies Act, they are immediately brought under the FOI legislation? These are simple and practical steps we can take. I urge the Minister to commit to doing an annual review of all the bodies to which the FOI legislation applies, including those bodies that are partially within the remit of the system. This would ensure we are consistently doing our best in terms of transparency and accountability. I totally agree with the Minister about not needing to rely on the freedom of information legislation. Although we will always need that legislation, I would love to have a situation where we do not need to rely on it to access information. As it stands, however, we have the FOI legislation in place and we cannot get the information half the time. We know there are breaches of the legislation. While I agree with the Minister that it would be great to see the day when it is not needed, we are very far from there. I urge the Minister to reconsider his amendment and recognise that the motion provides simple and practical steps, such as the enactment of our Regulation of Lobbying (Amendment) Bill, that can be taken. We should do the right thing in this regard.	spk_337

Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-07-13	dail	33	Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage	dbsect_38	"I am sharing time with Deputies Guirke and Stanley. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Sinn Féin is opposed to local property tax and the reasons for this are clear. The tax, as designed, is not only a tax on assets but a tax on debts, such that many people who are liable for it may have debts worth as much as 90% of the value of the property against which they are charged. This concern should not be readily dismissed as it is a real and immediate concern for many citizens. On 6 July, the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage was told by Revenue that, on average, 43,000 people defer payment of the LPT every year due to inability to pay. In 2019, 50,00 homeowners deferred payment, more than 48,000 of them because they were below the income threshold. Those who do so are charged 4% interest each year for deferral. While I acknowledge that section 37 of the Bill will reduce the annual interest rate from 4% to 3%, the fact remains that the 48,000 householders who were unable to pay in 2019 were not exempt but simply deferred payment, with interest accumulating on those deferred payments every year. Sinn Féin unapologetically flags its concern for the workers and families who see an interest bill accumulating for tax on their home, many of whom are saddled with mortgage debt or may even find themselves in arrears or negative equity. Sinn Féin is of the view that the LPT is badly designed and unfit for purpose. Instead, we favour the introduction of a wealth tax levied against assets, not debts. The issue we have with the LPT is that it does not take account of someone's ability to pay. It hits low and middle-income earners. A large number of pensioners have raised this issue with me on the doorsteps over the years. Many of them are still living in the home in which they raised their family and have many happy memories but they struggle to pay this tax and are very concerned about its continuation. It is clear that this legislation is ill-conceived and ill-prepared, despite the Minister and the Government having had years to prepare for changes that have been signalled for some time. This is reflected in the serious flaws in the legislation. It is also reflected in the Minister having pressed ahead with the Bill against protocol and against the wishes and over the heads of the members of the finance committee, and despite pre-legislative scrutiny not having been completed. The motion was passed last week and the Minister probably heard my protest in that regard. I felt that flew in the face of good parliamentary practice, as no request for a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny was made at the Business Committee. When this issue was discussed at the finance committee, there was no agreement in that regard and nor was there any indication that the debate was in the offing. We had not undertaken the proper and thorough pre-legislative scrutiny we had hoped to undertake in respect of this Bill. That is poor parliamentary practice and undermines the role of the committee. According to the Oireachtas website, ""One of the most important functions of a Dáil select committee is to consider Bills that are referred to it by Dáil Éireann"". We want to engage in debate and in scrutinising and talking through proposed legislation. That should have been allowed to happen, but, unfortunately, we were not afforded that opportunity. Perhaps the Minister would respond to this point in his reply. It should be noted that the introduction of a local property tax followed and coincided with a gradual squeeze on services. In that regard, the local property tax is, and always has been, intimately connected with local authority funding. Local government sources of income rely on central government transfers and own-source revenues such as commercial rates. Given that regional inequality was deepened by the financial crash and was barely recovering before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, fiscal equalisation has been crucial for the delivery of local services. Fiscal equalisation is essential to protect financially weaker local authorities and their communities and to correct the effects of regional inequality and the unequal distribution of sources of finance. Before the introduction of a local property tax, equalisation was achieved through general purpose grants. Those grants were determined on the basis of an historical baseline of supports. As the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe noted in 2013, ""the system of distribution of grants to local governments from the Local Government Fund is not transparent and the rules have been set without consultation with local authorities"". Little changed with the introduction of the local property tax. In fact, the baseline that determines transfers from the equalisation fund is based largely on the shortfall between the tax retained locally and the old general purpose grants, with little regard given to the actual fiscal capacity or expenditure needs of local authorities. I agree with Dr. Gerard Turley and Mr. Stephen McNena of the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, when they argue that the current regime is not fit for purpose. This legislation will coincide with local authorities retaining 100% of local property tax receipts, thereby ending redistribution of 20% of local property tax revenue through the equalisation fund. The Minister has stated that the equalisation fund will be maintained but funded through the Exchequer, with the arrangement in place over a two-year period beginning in 2023. The Minister previously stated that he will be guided by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O’Brien. I hope that goes well for the Minister and I wish him luck in that regard. However, this is an opportunity to redesign the equalisation model to ensure that it is fit for purpose. In 2021, 20 local authorities received equalisation payments totalling €133 million. As stated, the current model lacks transparency and has little regard for the fiscal capacity or expenditure needs of these local authorities in the service of their communities. This has left local authorities, even those receiving transfers through the equalisation fund, underfunded in respect of the provision of local services. Local authorities constantly raise their concerns regarding funding. Galway County Council is often concerned about having sufficient funding to do all that is needed. It is essential that the current equalisation fund and how it is distributed does not simply remain the same, with funding coming from the central Exchequer rather than local property tax contributions. Indeed, we need a new model of equalisation that, in the words of Dr. Turley and Mr. McNena, “is consistent with international best practice but tailored to the specific circumstances of the home country”. We are all aware of areas badly in need of funding. Despite the impact these changes will have on local authority funding, the Government cannot tell us how equalisation will take place from 2023. Turning to the mica redress scheme, and everything happening in respect of mica and pyrite issues, section 18 of the Bill purports to provide an exemption for those homeowners whose houses have been affected by mica and pyrite. Does it do so? It inserts a new section 10D into the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 which states that ""a residential property that has been damaged as a result of the use of defective concrete blocks in its construction"" will be exempt from the local property tax. However, this will only be the case if certain conditions are met. As set out in section 18, these conditions include situations where ""the property has been or is being remediated"" or, under section 10D(1)(a), if ""a confirmation of eligibility in relation to the property has been issued"". What does ""confirmation of eligibility"" actually mean? Under section 10D(6), ""confirmation of eligibility"" has the meaning given to it by the regulations that gave effect to the current and flawed redress scheme. In that case, applicants can only have eligibility confirmed once they have made an application to the local authority. Such applications must include an engineer’s report confirming damage caused by mica and pyrite. To spell out what that means to everyone in the Chamber and to those whose homes have been damaged by mica and pyrite, under this legislation homeowners will be required to have an engineer’s report, which costs more than €6,000, to qualify for this exemption to the local property tax. To put it another way, if homeowners whose houses are crumbling around them as a result of the mica scandal are unable to fork out €6,000 from their own pockets for an engineer’s report, they will be charged local property tax. The tax will be charged for homes that are not safe, have lost their value and will not be liveable unless a 100% redress scheme is delivered. Can the Minister not see that this is a ludicrous and unworkable exemption? Does he also not see that requiring an engineer’s report to qualify for a local property tax exemption is also ludicrous, when that report costs several times more than the annual local property charge. It is completely nonsensical. Can the Minister also not see that this Bill, as it is drafted, will lead to these homeowners being charged local property tax as a result of the Government’s flawed and broken redress scheme? It is for this reason that my colleagues, Deputies Doherty and Mac Lochlainn, have tabled amendments on behalf of Sinn Féin so that homeowners affected by issues with mica and pyrite can apply for an exemption through a self-assessment, with the Revenue Commissioners putting guidelines in place in that regard. Once the Government has introduced a 100% redress scheme for those homeowners - which is something that Sinn Féin will continue to argue for - the Revenue Commissioners can then undertake a look-back to verify that those who applied for exemptions through self-assessment were eligible. These amendments are sensible and necessary to ensure that homeowners affected by mica are not charged local property tax. I urge the Minister, therefore, to accept these amendments from Sinn Féin in the interests of these homeowners. Section 18 applies with reference to the current redress scheme, which is only applicable to houses in areas administered by Donegal and Mayo county councils. This means that the legislation excludes homes affected by this issue in Clare and possibly elsewhere as well. Will the Minister confirm this is the case? If it is, then this exclusion must of course be addressed immediately. I also raise another issue with the Minister because it concerns something close to my heart. While the local property tax will be impacting ordinary people struggling to get by, I am interested in hearing what the Government is doing to tackle the issue of vacant sites, which is plaguing many cities across the State. What is the Government going to do to make the vacant site levy a more effective tool to stop the hoarding of derelict sites in the middle of a housing crisis?One of these sites, about which I have regularly spoken in this Chamber, is close to where I live in Galway city. It is a prime example of this issue. The derelict site at the former Corrib Great Southern Hotel sits at the entrance to Galway city. It has long been an eyesore at the gateway to our city and has been the site of numerous fires and antisocial behaviour. It has been a great concern to residents for a number of years. Planning permission was given to demolish the current structure in 2010 and the site was added to the derelict sites register in 2015, which is over six years ago. Yet we are still stuck here with this eyesore in one of the most prominent locations on the east side of Galway city. We just cannot afford to leave lands lying idle in Galway when young people cannot find an affordable home and there is a crisis in student accommodation and massive housing waiting lists. While the Government is hell-bent on making ordinary people pay the local property tax, I am wondering what is being done to address the hoarding of this kind of land in areas like Galway city. The Minister has brought forward a Bill that contains serious flaws, some of which I have spoken to this evening. These flaws must be addressed as a matter of urgency. I also note that the changes brought about by this legislation will result in an increase in bills for 36% of homeowners, while workers and families who are unable to pay will continue to see their interest bill rise on payments they must defer as a matter of necessity. I reiterate that Sinn Féin is opposed to the local property tax. It is badly designed and has failed to deliver quality local services for local communities. It is a tax that charges debt, not simply assets. Given the legislation before us and the consequences it will have, I ask the Minister to address the concerns I have raised and correct flaws in what is clearly ill-thought-out and rushed legislation."	spk_304

However, the devastating reality is that this is not just something that happened in the past; this reality still hurts women today. While we regularly hear Government politicians lament the treatment of women in the past, those words ring hollow when we consider the CervicalCheck scandal. The fact that women with cervical cancer were told that smear results, which showed them to be clear, were in fact inaccurate, is nightmarish. Not only this, the revised test results were also kept from them for years. Let us be clear that the reason this came to light, and we are even having this discussion, is the tireless work of campaigners, who are people affected by this issue and people whose families have, sadly, passed away as a result. This Bill seeks to extend the period of the CervicalCheck tribunal but we need to listen to campaigners and their concerns about this. Of course, nothing will ever give them justice but we need to listen to them now. This must be the end of this State’s systemic mistreatment of women, once and for all. I urge the Minister to listen to the campaigners and to those affected.	spk_271
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-07-06	dail	33	Ban on Rent Increases Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_15	"I commend my colleague, Deputy Ó Broin, on bringing forward this Bill. It is timely and necessary. Government policy continues to drive up the price of rents. They are now in excess of anything anyone can afford, as are house prices. In many senses, it seems to be mission accomplished for the Government. In my home county of Galway, rents have increased by 6% on last year, while rent for a double room in Galway city has increased by a massive 16%. The rent pressure zones, RPZs, the Minister's predecessor introduced were always likely to fail and now we have ample evidence for this. They were supposed to limit increases in certain areas to 4% a year but, as Threshold CEO John-Mark McCafferty pointed out, Galway city is a designated RPZ and rents for double rooms have increased 16% over the past year. Mr. McCafferty said this ""is yet more evidence that the RPZs are not being adhered to’. Deputy Ó Broin's Bill seeks to amend section 19 of the Residential Tenancies Act by capping the current rent on new and existing tenancies for three years. In Galway city, not far from where I live in Mervue, a build-to-rent apartment block is being developed. We know these funds are investing in property to make the maximum return, which means more sky-high rents for tenants and pricing local people out of the market. The Minister for Finance decided to exempt these funds from the 10% stamp duty charge that was supposed to deter them from these kinds of bulk purchases. This was done against the advice of his top civil servants and will mean more bulk purchases by investment funds and ever-climbing rents for ordinary working people in Galway city who cannot afford to live or buy in the city. That is not good enough. Policy after policy by this Government excludes people in Galway from renting and buying in their local areas. We saw the same disregard for the former top civil servants of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the ESRI and the Central Bank, who said the shared equity scheme would push up prices. It is not good enough. We need action now. This is a good Bill and should be supported by Government."	spk_217

I welcome the debate and the opportunity to speak on the future of banking, a sector that has come out of a crisis and is undergoing profound changes. In response to these developments, many, including the Financial Services Union and Sinn Féin, have called for the establishment of a forum on the future of banking, bringing in all stakeholders to discuss the current state of the sector, the challenges it faces and to chart a path forward that best serves the interests of customers, staff and financial stability. While the terms of reference of such a forum should be wide-reaching, its scope should be clear and well defined. While such a forum will focus on issues such as the digitalisation of financial services and small and medium enterprise, SME, lending, it must also pay attention to the lack of public trust in banks, banking culture and consumer protection. On 17 May, the Irish Banking Culture Board published the findings of its public trust in banking survey. It found that 43% of respondents said that their perception of banks had worsened since the 2008 financial crisis, with only 23% saying their perception had improved. Overall, 46% recorded a low level of trust in the industry with only 19% recording a high level of trust. In short, the public are not convinced that sufficient change has taken place to improve its perception of the industry. This mistrust finds its origin in the financial crisis of 2008 caused by a combination of Government failure and corporate greed. However, the financial crash and its consequences are by no means the only explanation for public mistrust of the sector. In its final report on the tracker mortgage examination, the Central Bank reported that more than 33,000 borrowers had been identified as having been affected by the scandal with €683 million paid in redress and compensation by the end of May 2019. As the Central Bank noted, since the examination began in 2015, some lenders initially attempted to minimise the number of affected customers to whom they would have to pay redress and compensation. As a result of the banks' actions, 99 family homes were lost by the end of May 2019.  This scandal left a deep and lasting impression in the eyes and minds of the Irish public, an impression that was periodically repeated as banks continued to mistreat their customers even as the examination was under way. Since 2019, three of the five retail banks have been reprimanded and fined a combined €77.1 million by the Central Bank. Disturbingly, even during the examination harm was meted out by both KBC and Ulster Bank with their failure to comply with the Central Bank's ""stop the harm"" principles.  Public mistrust in the banking sector is, therefore, a consequence of the actions of banks and nothing else, but responsibility also lies with the regulator and the Government. The most effective way to manage bad behaviour and reduce bad outcomes is to ensure that individuals are aware of the responsibilities and are held accountable for their actions. A lack of individual accountability paves the way for misconduct and the mistreatment of customers. In July 2018, the Central Bank called for a range of reforms that would enhance its toolkit to promote what it describes as ""a culture of ethical compliance by firms and individuals"". Among the reforms sought was the introduction of a senior executive accountability regime, which would place obligations on firms and senior individuals to set out clearly where responsibility and decision-making rests, thereby ensuring clear responsibility and accountability. More than three years since these reforms were first requested, the Government has yet to publish the heads of Bill of the legislation that would provide for them. This is simply unacceptable and reveals a Government that does not take accountability in the banking sector seriously. The legislation that provides for its introduction must be published by the Government without delay. Trust can only be earned by improvements in standards and the service provided to customers. As the public trust in banking survey recorded, only 38% of respondents agreed that the banking sector responded well in helping society during the coronavirus pandemic. As we emerge from the pandemic, the sector has an opportunity to rebuild trust and demonstrate change by the way it treats its customers. With unemployment unlikely to recover to pre-pandemic levels until after 2022, a cohort of borrowers will find themselves in some form of mortgage arrears and they must be supported.  The code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the mortgage arrears resolution process should have full legal effect with lenders working through the full suite of alternative repayment arrangements with affected borrowers. This code should be a statutory requirement, not an option. This must be coupled with an end to the selling of mortgage loans to non-bank entities and vulture funds as the option of first resort. As the deputy governor of the Central Bank noted in November 2019, ""the Central Bank is still having to push banks and non-banks too hard to take a customer centric approach to resolving arrears"". These issues must be included in the terms of reference of any forum on the future of banking.  The withdrawal of Ulster Bank and KBC from the market raises other profound questions about our banking sector. In a response to a letter my colleague, Deputy Doherty, wrote to the Central Bank, the deputy governor warned in December last year that the exit of a retail bank from the market ""could contribute to upward pressure to lending interest rates and potentially lead to weaker credit availability"". We now face the exit of two retail banks. Such change, and the risks it poses, calls for a new strategy towards the sector. I welcome the willingness of the Central Bank to participate in such a forum and regret the position of the Department of Finance in this regard. Just as it was appropriate for Departments to engage with stakeholders in the national economic dialogue, so it is appropriate for the Department of Finance and the regulator to engage with stakeholders on the future of the banking sector. I ask the Minister to now set about establishing the terms of reference for such a forum without delay. Today's debate also comes after the announcement by the Minister for Finance last week that he intends to sell the State's shares in Bank of Ireland in the coming months. More broadly, Sinn Féin believes it is in the interests of the State, consumer and taxpayer to maintain a shareholding presence in the banking sector. This includes maintaining a majority shareholding in AIB, especially as the market approaches a state of duopoly with the exit of Ulster Bank and KBC. This allows the State to pursue its strategic interests when key decisions and transactions take place. That position should be maintained. Furthermore, disposing of the State's shareholding in AIB at this time, or in the near future, would fail by some margin to recover the €20.8 billion pumped into the bank by the taxpayer. Sinn Féin has concerns about the timing of this announcement as regards Bank of Ireland, given that its share price has fallen significantly in recent years and its shares are considered to be undervalued presently. It is essential that any sale achieves value for money for the taxpayer and the Minister must explain why now is the appropriate time to sell.  At a meeting yesterday of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach to discuss banking, it came as a bit of a surprise to hear senior officials from Allied Irish Banks say the banking sector here is very competitive. I am sure that also came as a surprise to the many informed observers who may have been listening in. After all, the former President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, told the same committee that when it came to banking we had a quasi-monopoly in this State and that this was a contributory factor in driving up the cost of credit for homes and business borrowers. If a quasi-monopoly was an accurate an description in 2018 when Mario Draghi made those remarks, with the announcement from KBC Ireland that it is pulling out of the Irish market, it is really accurate today. I listened with interest to the comments of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, on the role credit unions could and should play. I have previously raised with them my view that credit unions have a significant role to play. They are trusted institutions in this State. They are not profit-driven institutions, they are run for the benefit of members and any surplus they generate is returned to members in low interest rates on loans and high interest rates on savings. The credit union movement has within it the seeds of a not-for-profit banking system. If credit unions were allowed to compete, they could become real competitors to the banks. The sector has been saying very clearly that it is being starved out of existence because it can barely get involved in the largest consumer credit market in this State. I have raised this previously with the Minister and Minister of State when I outlined in detail the regulations the credit unions set out to us, as I am sure they have done to the Minister and Minister of State, that place them at a competitive disadvantage. I note that today the Minister and Minister of State have said they believe in the credit unions.  I recall that when the credit unions were before the finance committee they set out what they need. As the Chairman of the committee pointed out, we hear often that people are in favour of the credit unions but we are not seeing action in that regard. Credit unions would be able to compete and would bring a level of fairness and allow the cost of credit to come down if they were allowed to do so. That is important going forward. I welcome the opportunity to speak this evening on the future of the Irish banking sector. I ask the Minister to respond to three points in his closing remarks, namely, the publication of legislation for the senior executive accountability regime, the establishment of the forum and the reason for the disposal of the State's shareholding in Bank of Ireland at this time and if it will provide best value for the taxpayer now and in the next six months. I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be delighted that I finished my contribution early."	spk_336

""Affordability"" has become a word that, in many instances, no longer means ""affordable"". In Galway, there have been no affordable builds for many years. People will hear the word ""affordable"", believe it is positive and look forward to perhaps being able to buy their own homes. Many people constantly get in contact with me and say that they cannot afford a house. With just 90 affordable homes available for purchase in 2021, though, this will not be a major cause for celebration. That number amounts to fewer than four homes per county. What will it mean for Galway? What about the cost-rental aspect of the Bill? We badly need homes that are available for cost rental. In my home county of Galway, rents are now 6.1% higher than they were in the first quarter of last year. In Galway city, the price of renting is up 16%. Despite that, just €35 million is being given to this scheme whereas the shared equity scheme will get €75 million. It is clear where the priority lies. The shared equity scheme, which will only be open to new builds, is a disaster waiting to happen. It is a recipe for more price inflation, which is why the developers wanted it. If anyone wants evidence to support the claim that it will be inflationary, the good news is that he or she will not have to look too far to get it. Research has shown that, in Britain, the average new build premium is a 29% markup as a result of the Tory party's shared equity scheme. In other words, it pushed up prices by almost 30%. We have had well over a decade of housing being in crisis. Rents and prices have reached unaffordable levels. Cuckoo funds are buying up large amounts of the new stock that is coming online, causing further price inflation. Now we have this so-called Affordable Housing Bill.

Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-06-22	dail	33	European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_10	"I want to discuss two issues. The first is the upcoming review of the EU's fiscal rules and the second is the reforms Ireland was requested to make as a requirement of accessing the recovery and resilience facility. In March last year, the European Commission suspended the fiscal rules by activating the general escape clause. Those rules place limitations on member states' deficit and debt levels and, as such, have a significant impact on the economic performance of member states and the EU as a whole. There was some irony in the timing of the suspension, as it occurred just as the long-awaited review of the fiscal governance framework was to begin. The speed at which the rules were suspended gives a clear indication of their procyclical nature. There was widespread recognition that, following the previous financial crisis, they served to stymie recovery, acted as a rationale for austerity and meant the eurozone spent a decade teetering on the brink. Fortunately, last year's suspension of the rules allowed member states to engage in the kind of countercyclical deficit spending that was necessary to prevent the worst from happening. The President of the Commission, Ms Ursula von der Leyen, said at the time that ""national governments can pump [money] into the economy as much as they need"". It goes without saying that this was a far cry from the response to the previous crisis. The review of the fiscal rules is scheduled to recommence later this summer. The Commission is widely expected to put forward proposals for simplifying the rules, thereby providing greater incentives for productive investment and changes to debt levels. The question is whether the changes will go far enough. The European Parliament has just produced its draft report containing proposals for reform and I was very disappointed to see they do not go nearly far enough. The Commission will soon seek submissions from members states and interested parties and it is essential that this State has its say. I hope the Government will outline what its position will be in this regard. The rules are now nearly 30 years old and, as long as they have been with us, so, too, have been the calls for their reform.Reforms proposed have included exempting public investment, cyclically adjusting the 3% ceiling, shifting from a deficit ceiling to a public debt ceiling, swapping the system of fiscal rules for fiscal standards, and so on.  At a bare minimum, we need to introduce a golden rule that would exempt member state investment in green and social capital infrastructure from debt and deficit considerations. I cannot see how a new European green deal and just transition will be possible without such a measure. The report of the European Parliament considers a golden rule, but it is so restrictive that it is unlikely that most member states will qualify. In the absence of this, I cannot see how we will reach our climate targets. Yet, I already detect the obsession with fiscal discipline being prioritised above all other concerns. That is creeping back in. It is exemplified in the article by former German Finance Minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, published recently in  Lastly, I wish to address the issue of the conditionality that was attached to the access of states to the recovery and resilience facility and the concerning request by the Government for confidentiality. The European Council examined the recovery plans for the EU. The Government has now submitted its plans. It has been confirmed that Ireland requested the Commission to redact certain sensitive information from its recovery and resilience plan as officially submitted on 28 May 2021. It is deeply concerning that such a large amount of public money is subject to privacy conditions. We need confirmation of when the entire plan will be published. We need a full list, without any redactions, of the reforms that the State has committed to implementing. As the Minister of State will be aware, the EU's so-called country-specific recommendations made specific demands on Ireland to reform certain tax rules and schemes. A full account must be given of how the Government intends to meet these recommendations in its national plan through changes to tax law over the coming years. The fund is significant and it is a welcome aid to our recovery, but the people must know what agreements were reached in return for it."	spk_158

Ba léir ón toghchán anuraidh cé chomh tábhachtach is atá ceist aoise an phinsin don ghnáthdhuine. Bhí an cheist seo i mbéal an phobail, agus ba bheag teaghlach a labhair mé leo agus mé ag stocaireacht nár ardaigh an cheist seo. Níl sé féaráilte, agus mothaíonn daoine nach bhfuil, go mbeadh daoine ag obair a saol ar fad agus iad den tuairim go mbeidh sé de dheis acu an pinsean a fháil agus iad 65 bliain d'aois agus go bhfuil an Rialtas anois ag rá leo nach é sin mar a bheidh sé agus go mbeidh orthu liúntas cuardaitheora poist a fháil, cé go mothaíonn siad go bhfuil sé in am dóibh críochnú suas lena bpoist agus go bhfuil sé ródheacair dóibh leanúint orthu. Tá sé togha dúinn mar Theachtaí a rá gur féidir le daoine leanúint orthu ag obair agus iad ag éirí níos sine ach bhí fear amháin ag rá liom go raibh sé ag obair ar feadh a shaol san earnáil tógála agus nach raibh sé in ann leanúint air ag dul suas agus anuas dréimirí agus é ag an aois sin. Bhí air dul ar liúntas cuardaitheora poist don chéad uair ina shaol agus é i ndáiríre ag aois a phinsin. Bhris sé sin a chroí. Tá sé soiléir ó na daoine go gcreideann siad go láidir go gcaithfear é seo a athrú. Táim tar éis a chloisteáil ón Aire Stáit nach mbeidh sé ag cur in aghaidh an rúin. Ní ionann é sin agus tacú leis an rún agus leis na daoine atá ag rá go soiléir go bhfuil siad ag iarraidh an pinsean a fháil ag 65 bliain d'aois. Is é sin atá á rá ag daoine agus is é sin an rud ba chóir tarlú. Given that we are on the topic of pensions, I raise a related matter with the Minister of State that I hope he will look at. It concerns the PAYE tax credit as it relates to the contributory pension. The Finance Act 2013 did away with this credit as it applied to dependants. For example, a husband could avail of this tax credit as it applied to his own contributory pension but not to his wife's pension as was previously the case. This means that some dependants now have a tax liability. This issue mainly affects older women. I ask the Minister of State to examine this and to support our motion in full.	spk_185

Not only will it help us to turn things around in the short term but, in the medium to long term, it will place this State on a surer, more balanced footing. I take on board what the Minister says in regard to increased levels of capital expenditure. The fact it is set to rise to historically high levels, while welcome, says more about the chronic underinvestment that has taken place over the years than it does about the scale of the present ambition. We need to be absolutely ambitious in regard to this because people deserve better. People do not have homes.

I have been looking at the area of public procurement and data collection, analysis and review in this area needs to be improved. A shared data centre could help to improve the interoperability of public administrative databases and could help cut down on data entry and the collection of duplicate data. As part of the drive towards digitisation, efforts are being made to cut down on paper records as these are seen as less efficient. However, it is equally inefficient to have multiple people across multiple Departments collecting the same, or similar, information. I welcome the data centre on that basis but I do, however, have concerns as to how it will operate.

Deputy Lawless mentioned that the data centres based here which are owned by private companies can use significant amounts of energy. We know there has been a sharp rise in the number of such centres operating here. In fact, a report prepared by the data hosting industry confirmed that the number of operational data centres in the State increased by 25% in the past year. The data centre industry currently consumes 11% of the energy generated on the grid and that is forecast to rise to almost one third by the end of the decade. Not only does it consume significant amounts of electricity, it consumes large amounts of water. For example, the average data centre uses an estimated 500,000 l of water per day. However, a particular data centre in Dublin reported it could use up to 4.5 million l of water per day. At a time when our offshore islands are experiencing water rationing, that is mind-boggling. The Minister has given assurances regarding the environmental aspect of this project. I ask him to be clear that the facilities will be run on renewable energy and will conserve as much water as possible.	spk_116
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-06-17	dail	33	Data Centres	dbsect_23	There is much merit in creating a shared Government data services centre. I have been looking at the area of public procurement and data collection, analysis and review in this area needs to be improved. A shared data centre could help to improve the interoperability of public administrative databases and could help cut down on data entry and the collection of duplicate data. As part of the drive towards digitisation, efforts are being made to cut down on paper records as these are seen as less efficient. However, it is equally inefficient to have multiple people across multiple Departments collecting the same, or similar, information. I welcome the data centre on that basis but I do, however, have concerns as to how it will operate. I apologise; while I did listen to the Minister's response, for the sake of absolute clarity, will he confirm that the centre will be State-run and not run by a private provider?	spk_113
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-06-17	dail	33	Data Centres	dbsect_23	If the data centre is to be State-run, that is very good news. Deputy Lawless mentioned that the data centres based here which are owned by private companies can use significant amounts of energy. We know there has been a sharp rise in the number of such centres operating here. In fact, a report prepared by the data hosting industry confirmed that the number of operational data centres in the State increased by 25% in the past year. The data centre industry currently consumes 11% of the energy generated on the grid and that is forecast to rise to almost one third by the end of the decade. Not only does it consume significant amounts of electricity, it consumes large amounts of water. For example, the average data centre uses an estimated 500,000 l of water per day. However, a particular data centre in Dublin reported it could use up to 4.5 million l of water per day. At a time when our offshore islands are experiencing water rationing, that is mind-boggling.

Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-06-17	dail	33	Fisheries and Coastal Communities: Statements	dbsect_31	Two weeks ago, I met with fishers from Inis Oírr who raised two key issues with me. First, they are deeply concerned at having to weigh the shellfish when they land it on Inis Oírr. There is no account taken of damage to, or incidental loss of, the catch before it travels back again by sea to the factories. The other key issue is the pier on Inis Oírr, which not only impacts fishers but the entire island community, which is one of the coastal communities we are discussing today. Since I was elected to represent the Galway West constituency a year ago, I have been shocked by how island communities have been completely forgotten and neglected in almost every aspect. Inis Oírr is a very good example of that neglect by successive Governments. I want to describe the hazardous nature of the pier on Inis Oírr for the benefit of the Minister, Deputies and any media representatives who are here. If people were aware of how bad it is, there would uproar. At the start of this year, videos were circulated, mainly in the Irish language media, of waves crashing over the pier wall, the force of which broke the lights on the pier. One can imagine how dangerous it would have been if people had been on the pier. The weather was bad but not that bad. The damage meant the pier had to be closed and the boats could not dock, which not only impacted the people of Inis Oírr but also the people of Inis Meáin because the two islands share the same doctor. Three mornings a week, the doctor from Inis Oírr goes over to Inis Meáin, which he could not do on this occasion. The redevelopment of the pier on Inis Oírr was contained in the Government's 2015 capital investment plan, Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021. Six years since it was promised, it is yet to happen. There was good news with the announcement the pier was finally getting the go-ahead but that was followed by further delay, with no clarity as to when the project will go to tender. It is unfair that the islanders are being left in the dark again. Will the Minister look at this issue and try to push it forward? Táim díreach chun ceist Chéibh Inis Oírr a ardú leis an Aire. Táim tar éis an cheist seo a ardú sa Seomra seo go rímhinic ó toghadh mé bliain ó shin. Tugtar neamhaird iomlán ar na hoileáin. Dá mba rud é go raibh píosa infreastruchtúir chomh criticiúil is atá céibh i gcomhair oileáin sa ndrochchaoi chéanna is atá Céibh Inis Oírr i gceantar rachmasach i mBaile Átha Cliath tharraingeodh sé raic agus bheadh sé réitithe ag an Rialtas láithreach. Tá an chéibh seo á gealladh ó 2015. Is sé bliana ó shin é sin. Bhí dea-scéal ann le gairid go mbeadh an chéibh ag dul amach go tairiscint ach tá an chosúlacht ar an scéal go mbeadh moill eile ag baint leis. Níl sé soiléir cén t-am go díreach go mbeidh sé ag dul amach go tairiscint. Tá faitíos ann nach mbeidh an próiseas ar fad críochnaithe roimh an Nollaig. Níl sé féaráilte go mbeadh muintir Inis Oírr fágtha sa ndorchadas arís eile. Tá práinn ag baint le forbairt na céibhe. Tá sé fíordhainséarach ach ní féidir le muintir Inis Oírr dul trí gheimhreadh eile gan forbairt ar bith ar an gcéibh. Caithfidh an Rialtas breathnú ar bhealach inar féidir é seo a bhrú ar aghaidh.  Is rud eile gur mhaith liom a ardú leis an Aire ná na srianta uisce atá curtha i bhfeidhm arís thar oíche i mbliana. D'ardaigh mé an fhadhb sin anuraidh ach níl tada déanta faoi. Táimid i lár paindéime, áit a ndeirtear linn go gcaithfidh daoine a gcuid lámha a ní ach níl uisce ann i gcomhair mhuintir na n-oileán thar oíche. Tá sé iomlán dochreidte. Níl mé in ann freagra ar bith a fháil maidir le cén plean atá ann chun réiteach a fháil ar an gceist sin.	spk_220
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-06-17	dail	33	Regulation of Lobbying (Post-Term Employment as Lobbyist) Bill 2020: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_40	Ar an gcéad dul síos, tréaslaím leis an Teachta Nash as an mBille seo a chur os comhair na Dála. I commend him on bringing forward this Bill. I welcome any legislation that seeks to shut the revolving door between Government and vested interests. We need to keep in mind the scandals of the past year that brought this issue to the fore, including the appointment of a former Minister of State at the Department of Finance to a position with an investment fund lobbying group. This showed very clearly the need for increased regulation of lobbying. That particular appointment breached the cooling-off period set down for such appointments, which sent shock waves through the general public. People were really baffled by how easily it could be done. What is even more shocking, as already mentioned, is that there are no enforcement powers relating to the designated cooling-off period. Deputy Nash proposes to empower the Standards in Public Office Commission to investigate suspected contraventions of section 22 of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015. That section prohibits former designated public officials from engaging in lobbying activity for one year after leaving their post. This is what is referred to as a post-employment cooling-off period. SIPO's power to investigate would apply to contraventions of section 22 that occur after the Bill is enacted, even if the former public official left office before that date. This would undoubtedly be an improvement on what is currently in place. There is scope to go further still, however. For example, it would be best practice to extend the cooling-off period from one to two years. The first Bill I co-sponsored in the Dáil, together with Deputy Doherty, sought to implement 13 of the 22 recommendations that were submitted by SIPO to the Government in May 2019 to extend its investigative and sanctioning powers. I will not go through all of them but will highlight a few. The recommendations included providing the commission with further powers to investigate and report on breaches of the code of conduct. Greater oversight of lobbying would be provided by extending the scope of section 22 of the 2015 Act to make a failure to comply with that section an offence. This would place SIPO on a surer footing when investigating complaints. We have had a review of these issues but what we really need now is action. This Bill, if not the Bill I brought forward, should be enacted as soon as possible. We need to deal with the issues head on and without delay to restore public confidence. In the interest of accountability and transparency, we need legislation urgently. A revolving door between politics and the lobbying industry is corrosive to democracy and undermines public confidence that our political system is responsive to the needs of the people of this country rather than those of unelected vested interest groups.	spk_319
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-06-16	dail	33	Arts Centres	dbsect_3	I raise the issue of children who are suffering with chronic pain and their families. In November 2019, the only HSE paediatric pain specialist left his post due to a continued lack of support and an intense and increasing workload. As a result, no pain paediatric specialists are left. There are also currently no private pain consultants in the country who see children. Therefore, children throughout the State who suffer from many different chronic pain conditions have been left with no one to help them. This has forced some parents, out of pure desperation, to seek care for their children abroad at great personal expense in addition to the enormous stress of travelling with a child who is experiencing chronic pain. However, even this avenue to care has now been halted due to the pandemic. Out of desperation, these parents have banded together to protest over the treatment of their children and to fight to secure proper and timely care. This campaigning resulted in many parliamentary questions being asked and multiple media articles being released. Under pressure to respond to this public outcry, funding was granted in December 2019 for two part-time pain consultant specialist roles and a full multidisciplinary team. This team was to consist of advanced nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist and, importantly, a psychologist. The parents knew it would take time to set up such a team. Therefore, they continued to advocate on behalf of their children for an interim measure to fill the gap in pain care until the full team was in place.  It was agreed that an interim measure would be put in place, whereby a pain consultant from the North was to be contracted on a temporary basis. Many parents were happy with this measure because at this stage their children were truly suffering unbearable pain as they had been without professional care for months and some for even over a year. However, others were not because this interim measure only extended to some, not all, of the children already in the system. No new referrals were being accepted until the full team, including the consultant roles, was in place. This is the case to date and none of these children has been accepted onto a waiting list. That is totally unacceptable and extremely concerning for the children and their families. The recruitment process for the multidisciplinary team took well over a year to come to fruition. At the end of January 2021, parent advocates were informed that the advanced nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists and physiotherapist had been recruited and were in place. The parent advocacy group has informed me that a consultant has been seeing patients within the last couple of weeks. However, they are concerned that there is only one consultant in the position. I ask the Minister of State to clarify if this is the case. Parents' fear is that if there is only one replacement consultant, history could repeat itself. The parents are also concerned that appointments will only be on the basis of consultant referral. For children with rheumatology-related pain, there is a four or five-year waiting list to see a rheumatology consultant. Children will be waiting for that and then to be referred, meaning they could be waiting a very long time just to see the pain consultant when they are in chronic pain. Can the Minister of State advise if these services are only offered on a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. basis, as parents have concerns about the status of out-of-hours services? They are also concerned that the pain relief outpatient waiting list reports, which are listed on the National Treatment Purchase Fund website, underestimate the actual size of the list and, thus, waiting times.In summary, is only one consultant in place and will a second one be hired? Will the team be operating on a nine-to-five basis? Can the Minister of State clarify the situation with the waiting lists and address the concerns parents have in that regard?	spk_6
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-06-16	dail	33	Arts Centres	dbsect_3	I thank the Minister of State and I will send that in an email. I understand there is funding in place and it is good we have clarity that there is a locum consultant and that amendments will be made in an effort to hire a full-time consultant, which it is hoped will attract more candidates. How long will that process take? When does the Minister of State expect it to close in order that the waiting lists can be dealt with? I understand there is a locum consultant but children have been waiting 18 months. They have had no amendments to their pain management. It has been a few weeks since that locum consultant was put in place and they have not heard anything since. That needs to be looked at. I am concerned about those children who have to wait four or five years to see one consultant in order to then get another consultant. I think we all agree that to see children in chronic pain and parents not to be able to give them the help they need is really distressing and has a huge impact on the children’s lives. We need to do everything we can in regard to chronic pain in children. I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Minister of State on this. We must do everything we can to put everything in place to help these children. I imagine we are all on the same wavelength on this. I will follow up with those specific questions in an email to the Minister of State. If he comes back we can push this forward in order that children in chronic pain can get the help they need.	spk_8

Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-06-16	dail	33	Common Agricultural Policy: Statements	dbsect_20	Tá ceist fíor-shimplí agam don Aire. Cén fáth an bhfuil sé ag troid i gcoinne CAP a bheadh níos fearr d’fhormhór na bhfeirmeoirí ar fud an iarthair, ar fud ceantair Ghaeltachta, ina chontae féin i nDún na nGall agus i mo chontae, Contae na Gaillimhe? Mar gheall ar a dhearcadh agus dearcadh páirtithe an Rialtais, tá feirmeoirí atá ag streachailt cheana féin, atá ag cur seirbhísí agus earraí fíorthábhachtacha ar fáil dúinn ar fad agus atá ag déanamh oibre iontach, chun cailleadh amach ar na milliúin euro. Tá Gaillimh chun cailleadh amach ar €5.3 milliún, Ciarraí ar €11.3 milliún agus Maigh Eo ar €11.4 milliún. Tá sé dochreidte céard atá ar siúl ar an Rialtas. Bhí an tAire ar son coinbhéirseacht agus é mar bhall den Fhreasúra ach anois agus é sa rialtas tá dearmad iomlán déanta aige air seo. Ba cheart go mbeadh íocaíochtaí lochtaithe tosaí ann. Tá sé go hiomlán mí-fhéaráilte go bhfuil beirt fheirmeoir atá ag déanamh an post ceannann céanna ag fáil íocaíochtaí éagsúla mar gheall ar bhealach measta atá bunaithe ar bhearta táirgiúlachta ó 20 bliain ó shin. Níl sé seo féaráilte agus tá muintir na Gaeltachta ag fulaingt dá bharr. I have a simple and straightforward question for the Minister. Why is he arguing against measures that would benefit the majority of farmers, including those in his own home county of Donegal and indeed those in my home county of Galway? Quite simply, the Government's being against the redistribution of funds to farmers in western counties will see Galway farmers lose out on €5.3 million. Many of these farmers are already struggling and are doing absolutely vital work. The Minister was in favour of convergence when in opposition. I note he told my colleague, an Teachta Carthy, that he was only in favour of continuing convergence through the transition period but I am pretty sure if farmers in my home county of Galway and in his own home county of Donegal were asked, they would say the Minister set himself on a platform of convergence. He himself has highlighted that small to medium-sized farmers with valuable entitlements might suffer. Why is he resisting this? Why is he continuing to treat farmers in County Galway in a fundamentally unfair way? The CAP has moved on; productivity measures linked to the early 2000s should have no bearing. How can the Minister justify paying two farmers who are doing the exact same job different amounts based on those outdated metrics?	spk_276
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-06-02	dail	33	Maternity Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	"Women are an afterthought in many instances, but particularly with regard to healthcare. Over the decades, time and again we have seen scandal after scandal in women's healthcare. That must stop now. It is unacceptable for maternity care to be pushed to the margins as we move out of lockdown. While golfers are back on the greens and we will be able to drink a pint outside from next week, pregnant women are once again forgotten. I have been contacted by many mothers and fathers who have been damaged as a result of this. One woman told me she gave birth in my local hospital in Galway last June. She was alone for most of the labour while her husband sat in the car park, also alone. He spoke about the devastation of dropping her off, alone, and waiting for her outside. I am sure the Minister can accept that this caused a great deal of stress for both parents. She said: ""I was alone in the bath for hours without the company of anyone, just a midwife to check on me every so often"". These are harrowing words. I was also contacted by a father who missed the birth of his child as a result of the restrictions. The Government must act and end the restrictions. The CEO of the HSE has said that the conditions are right to end maternity restrictions and the CMO has said there is no good reason to continue the restrictions. However, three weeks later I still cannot get an answer from University Hospital Galway as to why it is continuing the restrictions. It refers to when active labour is initiated. I am not told what active labour is.Labour is labour, and that includes early labour. Induction of labour is labour. Early labour is labour. They have not specified at what point in labour partners may attend. I am blue in the face trying to get an answer to these questions. In University Hospital Galway, partners are only allowed to visit between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. and only for half an hour in the neonatal intensive care unit. This does not go far enough. Fathers are not visitors. They are parents who are as responsible for their child as the mothers and their support and presence during the first days of their child's life are essential."	spk_49

Nuair atáimid ag breathnú ar an bhfigiúir seo, is figiúir uafásach mhór atá i gceist leis an gcoiste le maoiniú de bheagnach €1 billiún d’infreastruchtúr, do dhaoine agus d’aisghabháil na tíre seo tar éis ceann de na hamanna is deacra le Covid-19. Cuirim fáilte roimh an phlé seo inniu ach ba chóir go ndearnadh plé agus mionscrúdú ar na tograí agus ar an aighneacht a chuir an Rialtas chun cinn an tseachtain seo caite. Ach ar ndóigh, táimid ag caint faoi tar éis dó a tharla. Ba í Éire ar cheann de na tíortha leis an bhforbhreathnú is lú i gcomparáid le tíortha eile san Aontas Eorpach.Agus muid ag labhairt ar an tsuim airgid atá i gceist leis seo, mar gheall ar na fadhbanna atá againn leis an GDP, tá an tsuim airgid a bhfuair muid i bhfad níos lú ná an t-airgead a bhfuair na tíortha eile. Tá muidne i Sinn Féin ag ardú na fadhbanna a bhaineann leis an mbealach ina mbreathnaítear ar an GDP le fada. I dtaobh na mbeart atá luaite san aighneacht, tá go leor acu ardaithe cheana féin. Níl an t-uafás nua ann. Tá an-díomá orm nár pléadh an aighneacht seo sular cuireadh isteach é. Tá sé fíorthábhachtach go mbeadh plé agus díospóireacht ar aon rud chomh tábhachtach leis seo atá le cur isteach go dtí an tAontas Eorpach agus go mbeadh tuairimí chuile dhuine ina leith pléite agus curtha in iúl. Last week, during a debate on the Order of Business, I voiced my concerns that we would be debating the recovery and resilience plan after the Government had already made its submission. As the Minister will be aware, at the time Sinn Féin requested that the debate be held beforehand. I tried to get it on the Order of Business last week because I really believe that a debate on this matter should have taken place. While I welcome this debate, it is taking place after the fact and after the horse has bolted. The reality is that, prior to today, there has not been substantial engagement with the Oireachtas or Oireachtas committees on the plan. As such, there has been limited Oireachtas scrutiny in the preparation of the recovery and resilience plan. That is really unfortunate. It would have been nothing but positive to include people and to allow them to speak and have a discussion on this submission rather than waiting, keeping it secret and then bringing it before the House after the fact. It was a missed opportunity on the part of the Government. There was public consultation on the matter but it should have been spoken about in this Chamber. The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, on which I sit, sought further information and engagement on it but, again, that did not happen. This State has had some of the lowest levels of parliamentary engagement and democratic oversight with regard to these submissions among EU member states. In my short time here in Leinster House, I have been struck by how little engagement there is with the Opposition in respect of matters like this, particularly when they cost money. We often see money messages being refused for Opposition Private Members' Bills and the like. We even see this issue in the Opposition's limited role in the budgetary cycle. When it comes to matters such as this, we have even less input. Given the scale of the funds involved and the conditions the Commission has reportedly attached to those funds, it was poor practice and a missed opportunity not to hold this debate earlier. The draft plan is now undergoing formal assessment by the European Commission before being submitted to the Council of the European Union. We have heard that Ireland is to receive an allocation of €915 million from the EU as part of its €750 billion pandemic recovery fund. We have heard that the Government's plans outline 16 investments and nine areas for reform. Our allocated portion of the recovery fund is, of course, small compared to those of other EU jurisdictions. As we have said many times, our overly inflated GDP means that we look like we are in better shape than we, and the ordinary people of the State, are actually in. As a consequence, we often receive less than we deserve. For instance, Finland will receive almost three times what we are getting. Of course, Ireland is a net contributor to the EU budget. During the period from 2021 to 2027, we will be paying approximately €25 billion to the EU's budget. In this context, our allocation of less than €1 billion seems small. Moving on from that issue, as I believe I have made my point quite clearly, I will speak on the plan itself. I will first mention the positives. Some of the things that we ourselves had suggested in this regard have been included, including an electronic system for sharing medical records, something for which we have been calling for a long time and which has long been needed. Another is the proposal for regional work hubs, which are absolutely needed. In light of how people have changed their views on where to live and work, this is important. There are also proposals to retrofit State buildings and to invest in public transport. These are all measures we had recommended so I welcome their inclusion by the Government. With regard to some of the other measures outlined, however, it seems to be a case of reheating last night's dinner and trying to present it as a freshly cooked meal. Some of the infrastructural proposals have already been announced in the national development plan. The river basin management plan was announced three years ago. The rehabilitation of peatlands was also announced previously. It is said that, to protect the environment, we should all try to reduce, reuse and recycle but I was not aware that this also applied to Government policies. One of the big flagship projects which is news is the retrofitting plan but it has not been well thought through. Obviously, what we want is to improve the energy efficiency of homes. People want that for their own homes. Many of my friends and colleagues are in that situation. The reality, however, is that the costs proved to be prohibitive. The average cost of retrofitting a house is approximately €50,000 and it can be up to €80,000. We again heard discussion of this on ""Morning Ireland"" this morning. What we are talking about here are loans. We know that the State can borrow at negative rates and that we are to receive this sum of nearly €1 billion, but the Government is expecting people to pay interest of 3.5% on a loan for a procedure which is absolutely unaffordable for many. If the Government wants significant uptake of retrofitting, we need to look at the cost. The plan does not do that. The State is the largest consumer in the economy and, through economies of scale, it could work to bring down the price. The Government, of course, knows this.  This applies not only to retrofitting but to the construction of housing. In our submission in respect of the recovery and resilience fund, we made the case that additional money, which we called capital catch-up, should be allocated to help to put the construction of housing back on track. We are badly behind targets due to the restrictions. We have heard that the Minister has concerns with regard to capital spending targets which may not be reached. This was reported in the media. Yesterday, the Government announced its economic recovery plan of which the recovery and resilience fund forms part. This document says that the Government has a target of 33,000 homes per annum. My major concern is that this target will not be reached. Of course, the issue of our housing deficit has been identified by the EU as one of the reform areas we need to address but hidden on the last page of the submission, in the annex, social and affordable housing is listed as an area on which we need to work. I can tell the Minister that this is not news to many people. Last month, we even saw the International Monetary Fund point out that we have a deficit in respect of housing so, for the life of me, I cannot understand why this has not been given priority status with regard to the fund. I am sure that when the EU told us that we needed to address this crisis in housing, it would have been assumed that some of this €1 billion in funding would have been used to invest in housing. It seems, however, that once again the Government is just not taking the housing situation seriously. To sum up, there are some proposals in the Government's plan that are new and some that are useful. Unfortunately, it seems that the useful ones are not new and the new ones are not useful."	spk_226
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-06-01	dail	33	Situation in Belarus: Motion	dbsect_17	Tá mé ag roinnt mo chuid ama le mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Andrews. Ireland was drawn into what happened in Belarus by the nature of the arrest of Roman Protasevich. The fact that a Ryanair aeroplane - and therefore, in many senses, an Irish aeroplane - was forced into an emergency landing, which brought increased dangers to all the 130 passengers on board, made the Government's intervention expected and necessary. The Government has been strong on this, demanding answers from the Belarusian Government in relation to this emergency landing. There has been clear shock from the Irish people that this has happened and that one of our aeroplanes was forced into an emergency landing.The answer that has been received so far that there were fears there was a bomb on board the same aeroplane that carried Roman Protasevich certainly seems a lot more than a coincidence. The concern internationally regarding freedom of the press has been quite resounding and the action by the EU, through the imposition of sanctions, has been very swift. It is deeply unfortunate that the same swift action in terms of the immediate imposition of sanctions with regard to the freedom of the press was not taken by the EU in the targeting of media outlets by the Israeli air force in Gaza two weeks ago. We must be clear that we tolerate no attacks on the media, no matter where they are. Outrage and swift action should not simply be confined to attacks on the media. The killing of civilians, including many children, in Gaza should have been sufficient reason for the international community to act swiftly on Israel's apartheid regime. The Minister for Foreign Affairs met recently with the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, and National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, about the situation in Belarus. I note that both were unequivocal in their outrage regarding same. While the US does not have a direct say about what will happen to Roman Protasevich, it does have a direct say on another journalist who is being held captive, namely, Julian Assange. He is someone I have raised in this Chamber on several occasions. I hope the Minister used this opportunity to raise his case and call for his immediate release, as it would be utterly hypocritical not to do so when raising the case of another journalist, Roman Protasevich. Julian Assange is facing charges for spreading information in a normal journalistic way and the silence on this from the international community has been deafening, as has been the silence of the very newspapers that published the information he gathered.	spk_186

Ag an am céanna, níl bealach ar bith isteach acu chuig an ionad vacsaíne i mBaile an Bhriotaigh i gcathair na Gaillimhe, mar níl bus nó traein a théann isteach ann agus muna bhfuil carr acu níl bealach ar bith acu an vacsaín seo a fháil. Dúirt an tAire níos luaithe go bhfuil sé chun athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar na hathruithe ar an mbealach stórála don vacsaín AstraZeneca. An mbeidh impleachtaí aige sin ar dhaoine cosúil leo seo? An bhfuil an tAire chun réiteach a fháil ar an bhfadhb seo i gcomhair daoine i gceantair iargúlta ar nós Conamara agus Gaeltachtaí eile? I wish to raise with the Minister the following issue. A number of people from Connemara have contacted me. They have reported that their GP is not providing them with the vaccine and they are having difficulties in getting to Ballybrit, where the vaccination centre is located for Galway city. There is no bus or train service available to take these people into Ballybrit.  I missed some of the Minister's earlier contribution because I was travelling here. I am aware that he mentioned that issue of storage methods will be looked into in light of the updated advice in respect of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Will the Minister be looking into some way of accommodating people living in more isolated rural areas like Connemara and other Gaeltacht areas? I also wish to raise another issue with the Minister. It concerns cohort 7 of the vaccination programme. When will those in cohort 7, whose GPs have opted out of vaccinating patients, be vaccinated? Currently, it appears that some teenagers in cohort 7 may not be vaccinated until the end of the summer. The HSE had stated that the vaccination booking portal would be open for that cohort nearly two weeks ago. Since the cyberattack there has been little or no access to information for the people in cohort 7. Last week, only 1% of those in cohort 7 had been vaccinated, despite the fact that vaccinations were due to commence for that cohort from 1 May 2021. There are over 300,000 people in cohort 7 and only 2,785 of them had been vaccinated by last week. They are being told to wait until vaccination booking opens for their age group. How is that fair for 17-year-old girls who have been cocooning for the last year and a half? I ask the Minister to confirm when the portal will be open for those whose GPs have opted out of administering vaccinations.	spk_30

I am very pleased to introduce the Regulation of Tenderers Bill 2021 with my colleague, Deputy Patricia Ryan.The Bill will provide for greater regulation with regard to publicly procured capital works. Annual spending on public procurement here is massive, coming in at approximately €12 billion. This is approximately the same amount spent on some of the pandemic income and business supports. According to the Office of Government Procurement's most recent spending and tendering analysis for 2018, capital works are the largest component of public procurement spend, coming in at more than €5 billion. We know that for years Ireland has lagged behind our European peers in terms of capital expenditure and this has left us with a major infrastructural deficit, which the International Monetary Fund, the Economic and Social Research Institute, and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council have called for us to close. This infrastructural deficit is most acute in regional and rural areas. The recent stability programme update outlines that capital expenditure is set to increase over the coming years and I welcome this although there is certainly room to go further. The national development plan has identified numerous capital projects set for commencement and it is important these are rolled out quickly. However, it is essential that taxpayers get value for money for these projects. We do not want to face more scandalous cost overruns, such as have been witnessed in the national broadband plan, the children's hospital and, closer to home, the renovations in Leinster House. Our Bill is designed to tackle one potential contributor to cost overruns, namely, abnormally low bids. These abnormally low bids are sometimes referred to as lowball offers. The Regulation of Tenderers Bill 2021 would establish that abnormally low tender bids for construction works that have a contract equal or above the EU threshold for public works are regulated and would be disqualified if their low level is not adequately explained to the contracting authority. It would also ensure that performance in prior public contracts would be grounds for exclusion from participation in procurement procedure. In other words, if a tenderer makes an abnormally low bid for a contract, and if the tenderer is claiming it can complete the project at a significantly lower cost than its competitors, that tenderer must explain to the contracting authority how this is achievable. If the contracting authority does not receive a reasonable explanation for the abnormally low price submitted, the tender price should be rejected and the tenderer disqualified from the procurement process. The contracting authority should record the reason for rejection and submit it to the Office of Government Procurement.	spk_92

As we watch in horror as bombs are dropped on Palestinian homes, hospitals and media outlets, we feel their pain and critically, we know that as Irish people we have a duty to shout ""Stop"". As Irish people we do not have the luxury to pretend we do not know or understand. We have a duty to stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine and call the Israeli actions out for what they are, and that is apartheid. We have seen the continued Israeli settlement expansion, the forced expulsions and the refusal to grant the right of return to Palestinian refugees. Israel says it wants peace. It says it wants a viable two-state solution but actions speak louder than words and, by God, are its actions loud. It continues to place its heavily fortified settlements on Palestinian land. It has divided up the West Bank into Bantustans with military checkpoints. It consistently lays siege to Gaza and it does all of this under the pretext of self-defence. Palestine is the tragedy of our time. The peace activist Hanan Ashwari has said that the absence of international sanctions has enabled the creation of a horror in Gaza. It is a living horror and yet prominent politicians across the world engage in bad-faith false equivalence. They use language around this conflict that is designed to obscure what is going on. They talk about Israel’s right to security. Israel is a nuclear power with the fourth largest standing army in the world. What about Palestine’s right to security? In Gaza, only one in ten people has direct access to clean water. We have seen the horrific bombings. Does that look like a secure existence? We hear talk in the media of clashes and ceasefires, which creates the false impression that this is a conflict between equal forces. It is anything but. It is a struggle between a coloniser and the oppressed. It is a struggle for self-determination versus a harsh and brutal system of apartheid. This July will mark 37 years since Dunnes Stores workers here in Ireland stood against apartheid. Let Ireland once again stand up to an apartheid regime and pass this motion."	spk_147
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-05-18	dail	33	Ballymurphy Inquest: Statements	dbsect_11	"""It has taken 50 years ... for my brother and my neighbours to be vindicated. And that 50 years has destroyed our lives."" These are the words of Carmel Quinn, whose brother, John Laverty, was murdered in 1971. It is important to put on the Dáil record just how horrific that atrocity was. Between 9 and 11 August 1971, more than 600 soldiers entered the Ballymurphy area of west Belfast. During that three-day period, 11 people were brutally murdered. Last week, Mrs. Justice Siobhan Keegan stated that, in every single case, the death was not adequately investigated. That was because there was no investigation. She also stated that all of the deaths were in breach of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, namely, the right to life. Why was there no adequate investigation? There was cover-up after cover-up. On the same day that Mrs. Justice Keegan delivered her findings, the British Government had the gall, which comes as no surprise to any of us who understand Britain's dirty war in Ireland, to decide to propose an amnesty. Last week, Boris Johnson apologised for what he described as the Ballymurphy ""events"". What happened in Ballymurphy was not an ""event"", nor was it a ""situation"". It was a massacre. Words matter. It was a massacre that lasted for three days and where British army soldiers wreaked havoc on the streets of Ballymurphy. Ballymurphy cannot be apologised away. It was a three-day sustained attack. Let us be frank - the apology was just a distraction. The families are clear. They did not ask for an apology. They asked for accountability and justice. They have waited 50 years to hear the word ""innocent"", with far too many family members having passed away before seeing that day. We cannot make the families wait any longer. To do so would be to prolong their torture and trauma. Boris Johnson is saying ""Sorry"" on the one hand and, on the other, he is intending to grant amnesty to the very soldiers who murdered these people. That the finding of innocent and the rumblings of amnesty were brought to light on the same day was no coincidence. It is British state policy to continue denying these families the accountability that they deserve. We have to be straight with the British Government, in that people cannot destroy a community, lives and families and get away with it. The Dáil needs to speak with one voice and tell the British Government that amnesty is off the table. The Irish Government needs to be strong when telling the British Government that the mechanisms within the Stormont House Agreement, of which the British Government is a co-guarantor, must be implemented in full, not just for the families of Ballymurphy, but every family seeking truth and accountability. Without accountability, how does Boris Johnson even know what he is apologising for?"	spk_256

The way the Debenhams workers have been treated in the past year has been absolutely outrageous. These workers were first abandoned by their employers and then failed by the State. We have had enough of tea and sympathy. What they need now is action. These workers have given years of service to the company. They had to stand outside their former place of employment for months in the rain, hail and cold but still there is nothing. Not only have they had to battle the elements, they literally put their lives on the line by battling through a global pandemic. Once again, the powers that be simply do not care. One worker told me that this impacted on all aspects of his life. It has taken over the past year of his life and become all-consuming. It is high time we valued workers in this State and gave them the protections they need and deserve. The Debenhams workers have made clear they do not want any other workers to be put in the position they have been in for the past 400 days. They have worked hard all their lives. We saw from the scenes of recent weeks that they are being treated like criminals. Let us be clear. Working people have made this country. The worst thing about all of this is that it is not new. We have been here before and we have had this discussion and debate. We have even had the recommendations of the Duffy Cahill report, but still there is nothing. We need to remember that this is having a real-life impact on people. We can talk in this room and we may say this has nothing to do with us but it has a real-life impact. Many of the 140 people who lost their jobs in Galway had served the company for more than 30 years. Collectively, these workers served over 300 years at the company. After that length of time, they saw themselves as family. I applaud them for their persistence and express solidarity with them. They have fought hard this year and have suffered greatly. Their legacy is that this Bill should go through. They are standing up for all future workers and those who go through a liquidation. That is one legacy they can be damn proud of. I call on the Minister of State to support them in this.	spk_36

All of that, unfortunately, is simply a myth. The issue much of the time is that universities rely on financing from students, whether international or EU, to fund their activities because they are not adequately funded by the State. If students do make it to university, no student should be seen as a cash cow. However, there are many financial barriers to third level education. Without even going into the detail of such aspects as the student contribution that students must pay, there is the simple basic fact that rents are simply out of reach for most ordinary students. That is especially the case in Galway city, where I am from, where we have the second highest rents in the State. What I really like about this Bill is that it is specific about students' needs. It looks at those challenges faced by students, and specifically those students in purpose-built student accommodation. The strength of this Bill is that it has come from the students themselves, from their experiences and from their union. I remember very clearly that last September students were told to act like everything was normal and to put the deposit down on their student accommodation. In that same week, however, they were then told that all the university lectures would be online. The resulting situation was one where many students had already put down their deposits, and they did not see those deposits again. The students' union in Galway city dealt with 30 different refusals of a return of deposits in respect of one student accommodation provider because it was simply left up to the landlord.  Even this morning, I spoke to one student who has been waiting for seven months to get her deposit back. She has basically given up. This Bill, however, would legislate for that type of situation. It would also mean that students could give 28 days' notice in respect of purpose-built student accommodation, and that is important because we all know life does not always work out the way we planned. Some of this student accommodation costs approximately €7,000 a year and therefore this is an important issue. I am glad everyone will be supporting this Bill and it is important it is enacted.	spk_12

This was a significant step. One of the main criticisms of it was a lack of specific emissions targets. The draft amendment Bill of 2020 was a step forward in this regard in that it tried to set out a legal framework by which Ireland's 2050 climate emissions targets were to be reached. However, as my colleague, Senator Boylan, pointed out, it was full of loopholes. The amendment Bill of 2021 is more ambitious than its draft predecessor and I welcome this. It provides for many of the recommendations made by the committee, which is also welcome. It provides for 2030 interim targets with five-year carbon budgets, sectoral emissions ceilings, an annually updated climate action plan and a long-term climate action strategy. This places Ireland on a surer footing when it comes to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and will allow us to play our part in this transition. This will require a fundamental transformation of the Irish and European economies, with sectors such as transport, buildings and energy production all having key roles to play. We must recognise this as a bold, ambitious and exciting opportunity for us to create new jobs, new industries and new ways of life. As the Covid crisis recedes, we should see the tackling of this climate crisis as a route back to a more sustainable planet with an economy based on inclusive growth and shared prosperity. It was very concerning that a just transition was not mentioned once in the first draft of the Bill. It was even more disappointing that the inclusion of references to a just transition have been so weak in this redraft. Phrases such as ""best endeavours"" and ""in so far as is practicable"" are not a just transition and will do nothing to bring communities along the road to decarbonisation. The Bill fails to grasp the opportunity provided to reimagine and recreate the society in which we live. As we come out of the pandemic we will face a new challenge of unemployment, specifically long-term unemployment.Many have now been out of work for a year. That is, of course, considered as long-term unemployment. We have already heard from the Government that it is considering removing aid to those businesses which it no longer deems to be viable meaning that a cohort of people will not be able to go back to work. We are told, of course, that new digital jobs will be created but the reality is that this, too, leaves behind a specific age group who do not have those digital skills. We need to realise not everyone will learn how to code. We have an opportunity here to tackle this pending unemployment crisis and the climate crisis through the creation of green jobs and we should not let this opportunity slide. There is also an important omission that had been included in the programme for Government around the 7% per annum reductions. While I recognise this Bill sets a 51% reduction over the decade in law, it does not provide for the 7% annual reduction figures, which leading climate experts have said is a serious flaw. Ireland has been a laggard on climate action and has continually kicked the can down the road and missed its targets. We need to ensure the Government starts immediately to reduce emissions and does not leave the heavy lifting to the next Government, which will bring us up to our 2030 target. There is also a question raised relating to the accountability of those who fail to comply with the provisions of the Bill. We saw in  I am also concerned by the recent High Court ruling interpretation of the 2015 Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act which found that the Government is not a relevant body. That is ridiculous. My party has written to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and asked him to amend this before it comes to the Dáil to close this loophole. The 2015 principal Act first established the bone structure of our national climate Bill by placing it on a statutory footing, and the current amendment Bill acts as a connective tissue which ties our climate policy to specific targets. However, my lingering concern is we are awaiting the muscle fibres needed to drive performance so as to reach these targets, and it is seems like that job, in addition to others, may fall to a future Government."	spk_332
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-04-22	dail	33	Covid Restrictions Support Scheme Regulations and Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme Regulations: Motions	dbsect_7	I have written to the Aire a number of times on an anomaly in the CRSS and I have raised it in this Chamber. What I will say today is not something new but something of which he will be very much aware. My colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, mentioned it as well. Under the current scheme businesses without a fixed premises are not able to qualify. The Minister indicates the scheme is targeted rather than prescriptive but only those businesses with fixed premises that can show reduced footfall as a result of the restrictions will qualify. We know there are a great many businesses that cannot qualify for the CRSS as a result. When it was introduced, we saw these anomalies and my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, even tabled an amendment in January that would have changed the qualifying criteria for the scheme. Unfortunately, the Government rejected it. It seems, nevertheless, that some of the criticism has been taken on board with the launch of the new Covid-19 business aid scheme, which allows the likes of wholesalers, suppliers and caterers to be included. That should be welcomed, although unfortunately the new scheme does not address the exclusion of businesses without a fixed premises. It is an anomaly that needs to be rectified. In the interests of protecting as many businesses as possible, it would be sensible to include all businesses that have seen turnover fall by 75% or more in this scheme. It would have been a simpler and more inclusive scheme that would acknowledge the businesses out there that are continuing to struggle with non-payroll expenses and fixed costs. Their future viability is in doubt. We saw in the recent stability programme update that the Government would have no role in supporting businesses that are no longer viable. The problem is there are large numbers of businesses that have been excluded from these schemes that are viable. I raised with the Minister before some of the businesses in my county of Galway, including Killary Fjord Boat Tours and a bus tour company on the islands. They have historically been successful.When matters return to normal they will probably rediscover that success, but they are under great pressure at present due to the lack of support because they do not have a fixed premises. Their businesses are threatened as a result. It should be remembered that these businesses are embedded in the community. They are very important for these rural areas and form part of the commercial ecosystem. It might be easy to take the view that the exclusion of these businesses is only a minor matter, but it can have significant unintended consequences. Consider the example of the boat tours. As the economy begins to reopen and the tourism industry begins to see increased activity, these must be viable in order to attract people to the area so they will go to the shops and restaurants. While the Minister has saved money in the short term by excluding these businesses, it will more than likely end up costing him far more in the long term because of potential tax and business activity forgone. The CRSS has cost less than was projected so I urge the Minister to reconsider this, to allow these businesses to be eligible for it and to help them. It will help not only the businesses but also the communities.	spk_213

That lack of services has failed far too many of our people and sadly we have lost far too many people as a result. Make no mistake about it, mental health can turn to personal tragedy and it is incumbent on us to help our people and save lives. This crisis has been exacerbated by Covid-19 and we need an emergency response. Today's motion, brought forward by my colleague, Deputy Ward, is such a response. It is a complete and compassionate response that offers practical solutions. This is a real emergency and we need to act. Sadly, my home city of Galway has also suffered greatly from this lack of services. I have conducted an anonymous survey to hear people’s experiences of this. One response that stuck out was from a person who said:I see a different nurse or doctor every single time I have an appointment. They don’t have accurate knowledge of one’s individual case and therefore do not have much to offer in the way of useful support. I am repeatedly told to take walks and meditate when in actuality I need a therapist, I need eating disorder services (that don’t exist). I need trauma support.The list goes on. I have spoken with people who have needed mental health services and with different organisations and one message comes back loud and clear. They say that we need 24-hour mental healthcare. The lack of care outside the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. reflects an attitude of a bygone age. We need better than that. Mental health challenges are 24-7, so our response needs to be 24-7.	spk_3

Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-04-01	dail	33	Project Ireland 2040: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_12	"I am sharing time with Deputies Carthy, Munster and Ó Laoghaire. I feel under a bit of pressure because I do not think I will be able to top the previous contribution. I ask Deputies not to judge me. I commend the Rural Independent Group on bringing forward the motion and allowing us to have this debate. It is really important, as is the issue of development on a regionally balanced basis for all of us who live west of the River Shannon in particular, although I would say that because I am a Galway woman. Since the launch of Project Ireland 2040 and the NDP, the socioeconomic environment that underpinned both has changed drastically. We have seen that in terms of the chronic under-delivery of public housing. There is a severe housing crisis throughout the country, as Deputy Healy-Rae pointed out in regard to rural areas. There have been massive cost overruns on key projects such as the national children's hospital and others, which has severely impacted on the delivery of those projects as well as the commencement of other key projects. Alongside this, we are dealing with the economic consequences of a global pandemic coupled with Brexit and other factors, including the fact that the Oireachtas having since declared a climate emergency means our economy faces a three-fold threat. The call to review the NDP, therefore, was timely and welcome. I have been harping on about the following point over the past year since I was elected. Ireland's stock and quality of public infrastructure is very poor by international standards. As was highlighted this week when we were debating the rural plan, the infrastructure in rural areas simply is not there. The quality of roads is totally inadequate, as is that of the water infrastructure, the sewerage system and, of course, broadband. The quality is simply not there for people. There is also a lack of schools and hospitals, compounded by the fact that poorly balanced regional development has diminished so many people's standard of living and negatively affected the economy's capacity to grow in a more balanced, sustainable and equitable manner. We see this especially in the EU's designation of the Border, midlands and western area, which has lost its developed status as it relates to EU regional development and has been downgraded to the status of ""in transition"". Project Ireland 2040 proposes to redress many of these deficiencies by committing to €116 billion in capital spending for the period from 2018 to 2027. Exchequer funding allocated for public capital investment over that period amounts to €91 billion, with the remainder coming from State-owned enterprises. This works out at approximately €760 million per annum in additional funding from the Exchequer over the ten-year period. This level of investment in capital infrastructure is wholly inadequate to deal with the level of challenge we face in key areas, some of which I have mentioned, such as the areas of housing, healthcare, education and childcare, especially if one is to look at it in terms of regionally balanced development. Sinn Féin has continuously called for extra money to be put into capital expenditure to act as a stimulus over and above what has been already committed. We hear from the Central Bank that the country will face high levels of unemployment in the long term and we hear from the business sector that many business people are very concerned that they will not be able to return to work after the pandemic. We really need a regionally balanced injection of money into capital investment. We know the jobs multiplier effect that arises from such investment is high and that the benefits are great. We are not stuck for capital investment projects that need attention. Táim chun Céibh Ros an Mhíl a ardú leis an Aire arís eile. Is infreastruchtúr fíorthábhachtach é don cheantar.

Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-03-31	dail	33	Post-European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_21	It has been reported in recent weeks that Ireland's share of the EU's pandemic recovery and resilience fund may be reduced by somewhere in the region of €321 million as a result of GDP figures over-inflating the health of the Irish economy. Unfortunately, this comes as no surprise to me and many others. I have been highlighting the inappropriateness of GDP as a measure of the condition of the Irish economy for some time. Despite the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, forecasting that real GDP would decline by 12.4%, somehow this country, with the longest lockdown in the EU and record unemployment numbers, not only managed to grow but outgrew all of its EU peers. I cannot imagine that it is just me who thinks that there is something seriously off here. Lots of developed nations would not sneer at GDP growth of 3.4% in a normal year so to record that during a global pandemic certainly seems like the stuff of divine intervention. The reality is that the ESRI, the Central Bank and even the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, are aware that this measure is more or less useless for international comparisons. In fact, from an Irish perspective it is worse than useless because it is proving harmful to us I also want to raise the case of Julian Assange. My colleague Deputy Andrews and I raised this with the Tánaiste last month and I raise it again today because I am deeply concerned at reports about Mr. Assange's poor state of health, which is being exacerbated by harsh prison conditions. As elected representatives of the Irish people it is our democratic duty to be vigilant about human rights abuses both at home and abroad. Mr. Assange's case is of particular interest as the charges against him relate to his role as a journalist and publisher. His incarceration in a prison institution designated for those deemed to be the most dangerous in British society is of considerable concern. A country's defence or suppression of freedom of speech and of the press is a touchstone of how healthy its democracy remains. The Minister of State may also be aware that in recent days even the Pope has written to Mr. Assange. I ask the Minister of State to raise this case with the British ambassador at his earliest convenience.	spk_235

Táim fíor-shásta an deis seo a bheith agam faoi dheireadh. Bhí muid ceaptha an t-ábhar seo a phlé le roinnt seachtainí anuas agus táim an-sásta go bhfuil an deis agam inniu é a phlé, éisteacht leis na daoine eile a bheidh ag labhairt faoin gceist seo agus plé a dhéanamh ar an gcomhaontú agus ar an mBille. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on the Public Service Pay Bill 2020. We have waited a number of weeks to speak on the Bill so it was welcome to see today that we would be speaking on it. This Bill will form the bones and the connective tissue of the new public service stability agreement. I am glad to see that members of the trade union movement have had the opportunity to vote on the Building Momentum agreement. I had raised concerns that an uncertain situation could have occurred whereby the previous agreement would have expired without a new agreement being in the offing. I refrained from commenting directly on the Building Momentum agreement because I believed it was a matter for the union membership to decide and I did not want to be seen to be prejudicing the outcome. The results are in now.They were resoundingly in favour. We see that in the results from the two largest unions, SIPTU and Fórsa, whose membership voted in favour by margins of 91% and 95%, respectively. Notwithstanding that, some smaller unions voted against the agreement and I want to address some of their concerns. It is worth highlighting that their rejection was partly based on legacy issues that have not yet been addressed. I will deal with some of those in a moment. First, it is worth acknowledging that most of the unions have accepted this deal. Since the beginning of the austerity budgets 12 years ago, public sector workers have had their real earnings gutted. FEMPI, the Croke Park agreement, the Haddington Road agreement and the Lansdowne Road agreement are terms that will resound in the minds of many of those working in the public sector since the crisis that followed 2008. It is only in this past year that pay has been restored to 2008 levels. For these valuable and essential workers in our hospitals, local authorities, educational institutions, the community sector and public administration, this has been long overdue. Wages for general operatives in local authorities, attendants in hospitals and cleaners in schools start at around €25,000, rising to approximately €35,000 after ten years. These workers are the backbone of our public services. These are the workers who have taken the financial hit over the past 12 years only to see restoration arrive now. Certain media and political commentators have spoken on this issue. The reality is that public sector workers have had more than a decade of lost earnings as a result of the economy going into receivership following the mismanagement of a Fianna Fáil-Green Party coalition. We also had the austerity of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, of which the Tánaiste, among others, was part. Both Governments were supported at the time by Independents, who did not show independence of action or thought by standing up for these workers. These workers have had to spend their wages every week to make ends meet and have had a significant reduction in their standard of living due to the policies of austerity, which have manifested in a seemingly never-ending housing crisis, long waiting lists for routine medical procedures and creaking infrastructure. They will see their wages rise but they will never get back the wages that were lost. They have lost a decade. Public service pay has been decimated over the past 12 years. Let us not forget that these workers and others were forced to pay for the reckless risk-taking of the banking and property sectors. We are again seeing politicians fall over themselves to pay tribute to those two sectors. Some would have us believe that this is ancient history. It could be ancient history but it is also contemporary policy. Not a day goes by that we are not reminded of the events of more than a decade ago, such as with the banks that were bailed out with taxpayers' money and had their future tax obligations waived by allowing them to carry forward their losses indefinitely using what are referred to as deferred tax assets. They are now being thanked. We see the current housing policies, which are very much in favour of the developers rather than those who cannot afford to buy a home. These concessions, extracted by government for the restoration of pay, have delivered significant savings to the public purse, but our public sector workers are our most valuable resource. They have held the line during the pandemic and paid a high price with their health and, in some cases, with their lifeblood. They kept our system going during the pandemic. They have held the fort in our public health systems, from hospitals to nursing homes and from schools to State services. They are the lowest earners in our public system and they are the citizens of whom we have asked the most. They clean our hospitals, sweep our streets, run our laundries and administer our public services. They need more than pay restoration and they deserve more than applause. They deserve our considered gratitude and that consideration must be quantifiable. I hope to see that in the next public service stability agreement. These workers have the benefit of union negotiated terms and conditions of employment, which give them sick leave and special pandemic leave, but we should not forget the large numbers of private contractors who are being used in the public system. They do not have the same entitlement. This significant private spend must be examined and serious effort must be made to convert these private, for-profit contracts into direct hire jobs which offer safety and security to the worker and better value to the State. I want to say a few words about the FEMPI legislation, as some may question the need for this Bill and the reason the FEMPI legislation was not fully repealed. It is worth noting that between 2015 and 2018, FEMPI and the agreements that succeeded it generated a reduction in Ireland's public pay bill of almost 20% through a combination of universal and progressive wage cuts, a pay freeze, reduced rates for new entrants, elimination of performance bonuses and certain allowances, and reduced rates of overtime and other non-core pay. Section 2 amends section 4 of the Act to give the Minister the power to provide for an increase in remuneration save where this is set by or under an Act of the Oireachtas. This would appear to be mainly designed to vest more power in the Minister and to reduce circumstances in which legislation is required to give effect to public sector agreements. Insofar as this encourages collective bargaining at a national level, it is welcomed. One consequence of the 2017 Act, which gave a legislative entitlement to the increases in remuneration set out in the public service stability agreement, was that further legislation would have been required to take away that entitlement. The amendment to section 4 of the Act seems to be a clever way to ensure the State does not run into this difficulty in the future. Overall, it might be said that the amendment to section 4 gives considerable power to the Minister, but he probably already had such power or equivalent power under various statutory provisions or the contractual agreements of public servants. The sanction of the relevant Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, was standard practice in respect of adjustments to remuneration prior to the collapse of the public finances in 2008. I am aware that there are still some lingering issues, such as pay equality, and that the sectoral bargaining fund that has been established will be used to address some of these issues. In agreement with sectoral management, each union or bargaining unit will have the option to use some or all of the sectoral fund to address issues mentioned, but certain claims are excluded as these are decided centrally, including overtime, weekly hours of attendance, annual and sick leave entitlements and pension arrangements. Alternatively, the union or bargaining unit can elect for the funds involved to be used as a sectoral pay round. If they choose to do this, the unions encompassed by that sectoral bargaining unit can agree that they may not pursue any grade or pay-related pay agreements. I am aware that, despite all of this, some unions such as the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland and the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association have rejected the agreement. Sinn Féin's alternative budget called for the immediate pay equalisation of pre- and post-2011 public sector entrants, as we see equal work for equal pay as being absolutely central. Under a Sinn Féin Government, we would seek to address these issues. We would also ensure a living wage for all public sector entrants. Sin mo thuairim ar an méid atá á phlé againn inniu. Bhí ról lárnach ag na daoine seo agus na hoibrithe seo agus tá sé fíorthábhachtach go dtugann muid chuile chabhair a theastaíonn uathu dóibh.	spk_304

Is leasú simplí é seo ar an Acht um Chlárú Sibhialta, 2004, a thabharfadh cead d’uchtaithe a dteastais bhreithe a fháil nuair atá siad os cionn 18. Leasú simplí atá i gceist ach is leasú fíorthábhachtach é dóibh siúd a bhí uchtaithe. Céard atá i dteastas breithe? Tugann an teastas seo eolas do dhaoine faoin am a rugadh iad, an lá den tseachtain a rugadh iad agus fiú an meáchan a bhí siad nuair a rugadh iad. Sonraí fíor-bhunúsacha iad seo agus is scannal é nach bhfuil an t-eolas sin le fáil acu siúd a uchtaíodh faoi láthair. Tar éis a foilsíodh an tuairisc faoi na hárais máithreacha agus leanaí bhí go leor caint ag Teachtaí faoin tábhacht atá ann dóibh siúd a tháinig slán as na hárais sin a bheith in ann teacht ar a n-eolas pearsanta féin. Is éard atá sa leasú seo ná an chéad chéim sa phróiseas, ach is céim fíor-suntasach é. Tá sé in am againn stop a chur leis an rúndacht agus an cur chuige teoranta a ghlac an Stát agus é ag déileáil le huchtaithe agus iad ag iarraidh teacht ar a dteastais bhreithe. Is ceart bunúsach daonna é an ceart aitheantas a bheith ag duine, agus tá sé thar am dúinn éisteacht leo siúd a tháinig slán agus an ceart bunúsach seo a thabhairt dóibh. I commend my colleague, Deputy Funchion, on bringing forward this amendment. It is a simple amendment which will have a profound impact on all those who have been denied access to their personal information for far too long. The State has fallen short in many ways when dealing with adopted people. By withholding birth certificates, the State has withheld a piece of these survivors’ identities. They deserve the basic dignity of accessing their personal information. This is a fundamental human right that can no longer be opposed. These are matters that many of us take for granted, such as information about the day we were born or our birth weight.This is just a first step on this road but it is a vitally important step. This legislation provides an opportunity to make that impact.	spk_7

Ní leor díreach cuimhne ar an nGaeltacht agus ar an nGaeilge ach ar feadh coicíse i rith na bliana. Caithfidh muid a bheith cúramach freisin nach gcuireann muid an iomarca béime ar shiombalachas na Gaeilge seachas ar na constaicí a bhíonn roimh lucht na Gaeilge, ach go háirithe rompu siúd atá ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht. Céard atá i ndán don Ghaeltacht? Cén todhchaí atá acu siúd atá ag iarraidh a dteaghlaigh a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht? Ar cheann de na tosaíochtaí éagsúla a bhí agam mar Theachta Dála ón gcéad lá, theastaigh uaim aird a tharraingt ar an easpa infreastruchtúir cuí atá le fáil i ndeisceart agus in iarthar Chonamara chomh maith le ar Árainn, ar ceantracha Gaeltachta iad ar fad. Is éard atá i gceist agam ansin ná easpa bóithre sábháilte, easpa seirbhíse leathanbhanda, easpa cóireála fuíolluisce agus séarachais, easpa seirbhísí uisce leanúnacha agus easpa infheistíochta i gcúrsaí tionsclaíochta. Níl aon ghá go leor de na ceisteanna seo a phlé sa chuid eile den tír mar go bhfuil na seirbhísí sin ann cheana agus ní bheadh aon súil ag an bpobal go gcaillfidís iad. Ach ní mar sin atá sé sa Ghaeltacht. Nuair a theastaíonn an infreastruchtúr cuí le truailliú a sheachaint sa Ghaeltacht, tá an Stát ar iarraidh. B’éigean do mo chomhghleacaithe, na Teachtaí Doherty agus Carthy, cás a thógáil chuig an gCoimisinéir Eorpach um Gníomhú ar son na hAeráide, mar shampla, chun iachall a chur ar an Stát córas cóireála fuíolluisce a thabhairt isteach do mhuintir Ghaoth Dobhair, rud éicint a bhí siad ag éileamh le blianta roimhe sin. Táthar á mheas go bhfuil oiread is 1,300 araid rothaí séarachais ag dul isteach i gCuan Chasla gach uile lá mar gheall ar easpa ionaid cóireála séarachais don Cheathrú Rua. Mar sin, is deacair gan glacadh le tuairimí an phobail sa Ghaeltacht go bhfuil siad ligthe i ndearmad nuair atá polasaithe á bplé. Cén fáth, mar shampla, ar baineadh ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta an ceart a bhí acu a gcuid ionadaithe féin a thoghadh ar bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta? Cinneadh frithdhaonlathach a bhí ansin agus tá a fhios againn gur beag athrú airgeadais a rinne sé fiú amháin. Dúirt Fianna Fáil go dtabharfadh sé ar ais na toghcháin phoiblí do bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta. Ansin fuair muid geallúint i bhfad ní ba laige ná sin i gclár an Rialtais go ndéanfaí athbhreithniú ar struchtúr an údaráis ach céard atá déanta faoi? Tada. Cén fáth gur thóg sé míonna ar an Rialtas plean a aontú maidir leis na mná tí agus na coláistí samhraidh a bhí as póca de bharr srianta a bhain le Covid-19? Cén fáth nach bhfuil an infreastruchtúr cuí ag pobal na Gaeltachta cois cósta agus atá ag formhór mór eile den tír? Ón taithí atá agam féin mar Theachta Dála le bliain anuas, feictear dom gur beag an tuiscint atá ag an Stát ar phobail Ghaeltachta, ar mheath na teanga sa Ghaeltacht, ná ar an gcaillteanas a bhaineann le meath na teanga sin. Deir an scríbhneoir aitheanta as Kenya, Ngg wa Thiong'o, go bhfuil teangacha cosúil le tiomántán crua nó hard drive, ina bhfuil seanchas, saíocht agus saineolas na mílte bliain cruinnithe agus má chailltear an teanga sin, cailleann sé an saibhreas intleachtúil sin ar fad. Caithfidh an Stát plean cuimsitheach forbartha a aontú do na ceantair Ghaeltachta chun úsáid a bhaint as na hacmhainní nádúrtha atá acu ar bhonn inbhuanaithe le deiseanna fostaíochta fadtéarmacha a chruthú. Ciallaíonn sé sin tograí móra ar nós calafoirt domhainmhara i Ros a Mhíl na Gaillimhe; ciallaíonn sé tuilleadh deiseanna taighde cois chósta ar chúrsaí fiadhúlra agus mara; agus ciallaíonn sé turasóireacht éiceolaíoch. Ní bheifear in ann aon cheann de na tograí seo a fhorbairt cheal infreastruchtúir ceart. Ní bheidh comhlacht Stáit ná comhlacht príobháideach in ann lonnú i gceantar ar bith nach bhfuil na seirbhísí sin ann, nach bhfuil an cumas ag an gcóras cóireála fuíolluisce glacadh leo ná nach bhfuil na scoileanna, an leathanbhanda is uile mar iad sách maith dóibh. Thar aon ní eile, is gá don Stát tosú ag dul chun cainte le muintir na Gaeltachta. Dá ndéanfaí é sin, gheobhadh sé amach sciobtha go leor go bhfuil na freagraí acu sin ar na ceisteanna seo ar fad. Níl ann ach go gcaithfidh an Stát athrú treo a ghlacadh agus tacú leo seachas a bheith i gcónaí ag teacht rompu.	spk_143
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-03-03	dail	33	Banking Sector: Statements	dbsect_10	"We heard the very difficult news this week that Bank of Ireland is shutting 103 of its branches, North and South. Bank of Ireland has used the pandemic as a pretext to close branches and to cut costs. Its concern seems to be for its bottom line, with loyal customers and citizens of the State being forgotten. The State has been a significant shareholder in Bank of Ireland ever since we bailed it out. Let us recall that Bank of Ireland received €4.7 billion from the Irish State, including over €1 billion in preference shares that the State had required as part of its recapitalisation of the bank. The National Pensions Reserve Fund was raided at the time. Today it will be many pensioners, older people and those who are not as digitally literate who will suffer from these branch closures. Given the State's significant shareholding in Bank of Ireland, what role does the Minister have? What will he do to protect these vulnerable people? It seems that once again rural areas are being hit by a decimation of services and the Government must finally stand up for those areas. We saw more shocking news this week with what is happening with Davy's failure to hold its board accountable. What has been reported in the media seems to be blatant corporate malfeasance for which the Central Bank has imposed a fine of €4.1 million. History has told us that fines rarely work to change the behaviour of large financial institutions. It has been reported in the media that 16 Davy staff members including top level people - the media have even mentioned the current CEO - have hoodwinked their clients and deceived their own compliance department. It has been reported that when engaging with the Central Bank it gave vague and misleading details and wilfully withheld information that would have disclosed the full extent of the wrongdoing.  Under the Companies Act 2014, directors are required to act in good faith, to act honestly and responsibly, and to avoid conflicts of interest. Penalties for breaches of the Companies Act include criminal and civil sanctions. This morning on ""Morning Ireland"", the Minister called on Davy to make a public statement on the matter. Was that it? That is extremely weak based on what has been reported. Why bother? Is the Minister asking that so we can be told the actions were regrettable, they do not meet the standards of best practice and they will do better in the future? That is simply not good enough. We have heard all that guff before. We need to show the public we are serious about this. It is high time we introduced the senior executive accountability regime that has long been promised but never delivered."	spk_251
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-02-18	dail	33	Covid-19 (Enterprise, Trade and Employment): Statements	dbsect_7	The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, gives increased rights to corporations, for instance, the right to sue sovereign states through corporate courts, but it does little for workers' rights. The ability of corporations to sue states will act as a major deterrent for using the state apparatus to counteract these negative effects. Taking the example of the minimum wage, Veolia, the giant French company, sued the Egyptian Government for increasing its minimum wage. Thankfully, the Egyptian Government won. Nevertheless, it incurred legal fees and arbitration costs of millions of dollars. The Government keeps telling us that CETA is good for the economy but an economy is made up of the workers within it. Can the Tánaiste explain how a treaty which permits corporations to sue the state over a minimum wage increase is good for workers and, by extension, the economy, and can he give specific details in relation to that? We are awaiting the publication of the Duffy report on the pay and terms and conditions of workers in the early years sector. I would hope that this would be the pathway to professionalise the sector given how crucial these workers have been during the pandemic. A recent SIPTU survey showed that 90% of early years workers struggle to make ends meet. Given that the Government brought in the wage subsidy scheme, this could be a perfect opportunity to expand this further and give appropriate wages for the sector. Has any consideration been given to this?	spk_257

We are told that it will help tackle the housing crisis but at what cost and who stands to benefit? Similar arguments were once made about the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA. The LDA has disconcerting shades of NAMA, which is a State-sponsored body with a commercial remit offering great benefits to industry participants but large costs for those with housing needs. That sounds like NAMA. There is low transparency as key aspects are not subject to freedom of information, FOI, or the Regulation of Lobbying Act as it shrouds its actions behind a supposed need to get the best deal for the taxpayer. Again, that sounds like NAMA. It is inflationary in terms of house prices due to the requirement for the LDA to buy land from public bodies at full market value even if it has a lower existing use value. If we swap the words ""public bodies"" for ""private developers"", that sounds like NAMA. The likelihood of conflict of interests arising because the absence of a cooling-off period will allow a revolving door permitting LDA employees to gain valuable insider knowledge which can be leveraged if they move to industry. Again, that sounds like NAMA. If people are beginning to develop a sense of  Average homes in Galway city today cost €317,000, an 8.6% year-on-year increase, making Galway the second most expensive county in the country. People are crying out for affordable homes across Galway city. For many, the concept of owning their own home is merely a dream, but there is a good way and a bad way of doing that. Sinn Féin has outlined a clear policy on how to deliver those homes without lumping massive amounts of public money into another State agency that is unaccountable. The LDA is developing the 4.5-acre Dyke Road site in Galway which will be transformed into mixed use development with a strong residential element. Housing is needed, and welcome, in Galway. We have been told that this housing will be largely affordable in nature, but if we look at what the LDA defines as affordable, it is housing below the prevailing market price. I hardly need point out to the Minister that the current average of €317,000, which is unaffordable for most people, would technically be below market value next year if the current inflationary trend continues, and it is set to continue, especially given the shared equity scheme. It seems that when it comes to house prices for developers and banks, the boom times are getting ""boomier"". That is quite an achievement on the part of this Government."	spk_283

I will pick up on something the Minister of State said. He has chosen to engage in semantics, instead of dealing with the extensive research on this price-gouging practice. Dual pricing, differential pricing and price optimisation refer to the same practice. I am very disappointed by the Government’s amendment, which is kicking the can down the road. I did not hear the Minister of State talk about the reality here. A reality check is needed here because drivers are being forced to pay these high prices, when in rural Ireland in particular there are simply no other options other than to drive for essential journeys. Dual pricing is wrong and it must be banned. It has been banned in other countries and this must be done here also without delay. What other industry targets customers for being loyal? It is working out well for them because the insurance business is one lucrative business. There is no denying this practice is happening, and we need the Government to step up to the mark to deal with this issue immediately, rather than simply kicking the can down road. One man told me that he just got his car insurance renewal quote. One company quoted him €1,525, another company quoted him €749 and another €540. Is there any reason to that? Of course there is not, it is just a handy way for the big insurance companies to make a profit on the back of ordinary workers and families. The reality is that the costs are extortionate.A woman contacted me to tell me that her daughter is learning to drive and she said:We’ve been trying to get our daughter insurance quotes as a new driver. We may as well not bother. Who has €5,500 to insure their child as a provisional driver to get experience? Even when she passes her test it doesn’t get much cheaper, it is €3,500. How on earth can insurance companies justify their prices? Is Bille fíorthábhachtach é seo atá curtha os comhair na Dála inniu. Tá sé thar am dúinn déileáil le déphraghsáil. Níl tionscail ar bith eile ann a ghearrann pionós ar chustaiméirí mar go bhfuil siad dílis do chomhlacht.

Beidh sé ag dul chuig na coistí agus ba bhreá liom dá mbreathnódh muid níos gaire ar pháirt 3 agus páirt 9. Tá na páirteanna sin fíorthábhachtach agus chóir dúinn breathnú níos géire orthu agus muid ag plé an Bhille sna coistí. There is a perception domestically and internationally that Ireland can be soft on white-collar crime. On the issue of the transposition of EU directives which are designed to improve transparency and accountability and provide sanctions to deter those tempted to engage in wrongdoing, Ireland is often frustratingly slow to implement these directives. In fact, it sometimes seems that we are the unruly child who must be dragged by the ankles, kicking and screaming, to get in line with our EU peers. We were slow to implement the EU financial instruments directives which provided for greater regulation to increase transparency across European financial markets and standardise the regulatory disclosures required for firms. We were slow to transpose the EU anti-money laundering directive which was designed to combat money laundering and prevent the financial market from being misused for those purposes. In fact, we were so slow to implement this directive that the European Court of Justice ordered Ireland to pay €2 million in fines last year. That is remarkable, considering that a report by Europol found that between 2006 and 2014 Ireland had 2% of all reported suspicious financial transactions of EU member states. We have also been slow to implement the outstanding elements of the EU directive on the protection of the euro and other currencies against counterfeiting, which is the Bill that is now before the House. As the Minister of State mentioned, this is a highly technical but very important Bill. The deadline for transposing the directive was 23 May 2016. Ireland is the only member state that is yet to transpose it. By way of background as it is quite technical legislation, the Bill provides for the implementation of several European instruments relating to the protection of the euro from counterfeiting. It concerns measures to ensure the appropriate authentication of euro coins and notes and it calls on member states to introduce criminal offences and sanctions relating to counterfeiting of the euro and other currencies. It introduces common measures in respect of same. The directive also addresses territorial jurisdiction and requires special investigation measures. The importance of protecting against counterfeiting lies in the need to ensure confidence and trust in the authenticity of currency. The Bill provides for a range of new powers and functions for the Central Bank of Ireland in respect of monitoring and enforcing measures relating to suspect counterfeit euro currency and euro currency that is not deemed suitable for recirculation. Since its introduction in 2002, the euro as a currency has been continuously targeted by organised crime groups active in money counterfeiting. Counterfeiting of the euro has caused financial damage of at least €500 million. According to the ECB, there were approximately 24 billion euro banknotes in circulation, with a total value of close to €1.3 trillion.In the second half of 2019, the €20 and €50 notes continued to be the most counterfeited banknotes, jointly accounting for over 70% of all counterfeits. As the Minister of State outlined, this Bill comprises 31 sections and I certainly do not propose to go into all of them. I will merely touch on two of the sections which I think are the most pertinent and might need greater scrutiny on Committee Stage before making a broader point that I am worried this legislation will not address but which needs to be highlighted as it relates to wider criminality and white-collar crime. The first section I wish to highlight is section 3, which expands definitions to include computer programmes, data and other means of counterfeiting. I note that the Government has made certain commitments on combating cybercrime in the report on the future of policing, including the provision of more expertise and resourcing for emerging areas of crime, especially related to technological innovation. It is worth flagging that there is concern that some gangs have become increasingly technically savvy and are able to use bitcoin and those kinds of things for illicit transactions. I hope that the additional resources that have been promised will meet the needs of the moment because laws are all fine and good but if these organised crime gangs are becoming more technically savvy than our law enforcement officials, there is a real risk they will be able to run rings around the law. Enforcement is, of course, key, as well as resourcing. I also wish to flag section 9 of the Bill, which concerns criminal liability for corporate bodies where they or their staff may have been engaging in, or benefiting from, counterfeiting. However, just as was the case with the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2020 we discussed two weeks ago relating to fraud and embezzlement against the EU budget, there is a significant defence created for these entities if they can prove they took ""all reasonable steps and exercised all due diligence"" to prevent such behaviour. I have concerns about this provision because this potentially provides a get-out-of-jail-free card for larger companies that might benefit from these activities, particularly financial institutions. A recent example of which we are all aware was the so-called Russian Laundromat, which showed the interactions between dark networks and white-collar crime. In other words, there are occasions when illicit financial transactions can use the licit economy to disguise the proceeds of crime. I would be concerned were there to be light-touch regulation that makes our financial system susceptible to misuse by those engaging in financial crimes. That is, of course, very concerning. Anyone who has ever reviewed some of the prospectuses for certain companies from emerging markets that list debt on the Stock Exchange and some of the questionable risks they list therein will know what I am talking about. This will need to be looked at more closely on Committee Stage but I flag those concerns today. I also raise an issue that I do not think has been addressed by the various EU directives that have been transposed recently and which relates to organised and white-collar crime. It plays a key role in illicit financial transactions and touches on the idea that legitimate parts of our financial system can be used in the service of illicit purposes. The issue to which I am referring is the use of high denomination notes. High denomination cash notes are, of course, perfectly legal but the reality is there is considerable concern that they are primarily used by people involved in organised crime. We know that high denomination notes play a significant role in global money laundering, corruption, tax dodging and organised crime. We can all ask ourselves when was the last time we saw a €500 note in the flesh. I would hazard a guess that most people have never seen one, let alone had one in their possession. There is concern about that. Over ten years ago, Britain's regulatory authorities banned the use of €500 banknotes in Britain after a study by the financial intelligence unit found that more than 90% of €500 banknotes in Britain were used by criminals. Tests by the Serious Organised Crime Agency revealed that it was possible to carry €25,000 in €500 notes in a cigarette packet, €300,000 in a cereal box and €1 million in a small briefcase. That provides a stark visual for how these high denomination notes can be used and how easily they can be transported. The €500 note is the highest value euro banknote and was produced from the introduction of the euro in 2002 until it stopped being printed in 2014. Two years ago, the printing of this banknote was stopped by central banks in the euro area but it nevertheless continues to be legal tender and can be used as a means of payment. Whether it needs to be taken out of circulation altogether needs to be looked at. Mar a dúirt an tAire Stáit ag an tús, tá sé fíorshoiléir gur Bhille sách teicniúil é seo agus go bhfuil sé tábhachtach. Mar sin, táimid ag tacú leis. Beidh sé an-suimiúil é a phlé sa choiste agus mar a dúirt mé, ba cheart dúinn breathnú ar an dá alt sin, alt 3 agus alt 9, chun cinntiú go bhfuilimid ag déanamh chuile rud gur féidir linn chun stop a chur leis an gcineál oibre seo nó an misuse ar chúrsaí airgid. Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh muid chuile rud gur féidir linn chun stop a chur leis seo."	spk_3
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-02-03	dail	33	Household Utility Bills Support: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_2	I commend my colleague, Deputy Kerrane, on bringing this motion to the floor of the Dáil. It is a reasonable motion with practical solutions that would dramatically improve the lives of many. Fuel poverty means that people literally do not have the ability to afford to heat their homes for them and their families. Families choose between putting food on the table, heating their homes and paying bills. We have the fuel allowance but there is clear evidence that in its current form, it simply does not go far enough because despite this allowance, the reality is that many still cannot afford to meet their heating needs and in their absolute desperation, have to turn to charities, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, that will pay for deliveries of oil or coal, or pay their electricity bills. This should not be happening. The State should ensure its citizens do not experience cold due to affordability. Heating is a basic need and it is life critical.I spoke to one carer in Galway city who assists many elderly people across the city. The very difficult and upsetting reality is that a lot of elderly people to whom she calls stay in one room in the house, usually the kitchen, for the entirety of the day until they go to bed because they simply cannot afford to heat the rest of the house. I am sure we can all think of elderly friends, neighbours and relatives who do this. Even more shockingly, she told me that some elderly people stay in bed until the afternoon when the afternoon carer comes because they do not have the ability to keep the fire going all day. Some of them even decline to have a shower because the house is so cold. How horrendous is that? This has a knock-on effect because when people stay in bed it reduces their mobility and increases the chance of them getting sores. It is not just the elderly that this is affecting. Another woman told me that she can pay for only one bag of coal a week, which means that she can only light the fire in the afternoon. As a result, at a time when we are asking people to stay at home, she wakes up in a cold house and she must wait in the cold until she can heat the house simply because she is on a low income. Another woman told me that this winter, for the very first time, she had to go to a moneylender to pay to heat her home. We can do something about this by accepting the motion. It makes sense to extend the fuel allowance to PUP recipients. It also makes sense to suspend the requirement of being in receipt of jobseeker's payments for 15 months. In addition, it makes sense to make a double payment of the fuel allowance to all existing recipients for two weeks in February. Let us all come together and support Deputy Kerrane's motion and improve the lives of people in communities.	spk_2

Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-02-03	dail	33	Finance Act 2004 (section 91) (Deferred Surrender to the Central Fund) Order 2020: Motion	dbsect_14	This is a technical motion and it relates to capital carry-over from one year to the next. Sinn Féin will be supporting it. This year it represents money included in the 2020 voted allocation that has been unspent. Since the 2004 Act we have a facility to carry over unspent capital expenditure. Section 91 of the Act specified that the provisions would be up to a maximum of 10% of the capital allocation by Vote. This applies only to capital expenditure and not current spending. To allow for spending of the capital carry-over amounts in the following year, the Minister is required to make an order not later than 31 March of that year determining the capital carry-over amounts by subhead that will be available for expenditure in those subheads, consistent with the amounts by Vote included in the Appropriation Act. Dáil approval of the draft ministerial order is required before the Minister can make the order. Once the order is made, the carry-over amounts become a first charge against the subheads considered. This allows for spending of the capital carry-over amounts from the previous year. This process was put in place in the hope of improving departmental budget management and improved flexibility rather than rushing to spend the budget at the year end, Departments can carry unspent money over and look at budgets more in terms of multi-annual envelopes. When I spoke on the Appropriation Bill in December we thought the underspend was approximately €740 million, but this was only an estimate and today we know that the actual underspend was approximately €710 million. To be precise, the exact capital carry-over for 2021 was €709.9 million. This represents approximately 7.2% of the 2020 allocation that will be carried over. This reduction is accounted for largely due to the Department of Health having a larger spend than was thought in December. The Department did not have a sufficient level of savings at year end and, accordingly, its carry-over has been adjusted on the order to the lower amount of €68 million. The total underspend is striking when compared to 2019 when approximately €200 million was carried over. Covid restrictions have obviously played a major part in that. The furloughing of large sections of the construction industry brought many building sites to a standstill and that has meant that many Departments were not able to progress capital projects in the manner they had envisaged pre-Covid. Delays have arisen not just in construction but also in the areas of planning and procurement. It goes without saying that the amount of carry-over being sought this year is considerably higher than the amount requested in previous years and this is against the backdrop of the impact of Covid-19. We must ensure the capital expenditure allocation and the amount that is carried over is used to deal with the creaking infrastructure.One example of substandard infrastructure that is not fit for purpose and is extremely dangerous for local people is the pier at Inis Oírr. Last Sunday night the passenger boat could not dock at the pier because of heavy swelling and overtopping. The boat attempted to dock again on Monday morning to bring the doctor who serves both Inis Oírr and Inis Meáin to the latter but could not do so. As a result, Inis Meáin was left without a doctor in the middle of a pandemic. I have seen footage of this overtopping, with waves coming over the pier wall onto local residents who were attempting to get the boat. This is extremely dangerous. Those people could have easily been swept into the sea and there could have been fatalities. I will send copies of that video to the Minister so that nobody in Government can claim they did not know anything about it. The weather was bad this week but it has been a lot worse previously. This development was promised in 2015. I have written to the Minister for Community and Rural Development, Deputy Humphreys, about this and have raised it with her previously. I urge the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to work with her on this as a matter of urgency. The Government must communicate with the islanders who have been left in the dark and must ensure that funds are made available for this development before someone is seriously injured or killed. Nobody here can say that they did not know. Tá contúirt mhór ag baint leis an gcéibh, rud a chonaic muid arís ag an deireadh seachtaine. Ní raibh an bád farantóireachta in ann dul i dtír oíche Domhnaigh agus arís maidin Dé Luain nuair a rinne sé iarracht eile. Mar gheall air sin, ní raibh an dochtúir in ann dul ó Inis Oírr go hInis Meáin agus ní raibh dochtúir ag muintir Inis Meáin i lár géarchéim sláinte. Bhí éirí mór san fharraige agus bhí an taoide ag dul trasna na céibhe. Chonaic mé físeán dó agus tá mé chun é a sheol chuig an Aire. Bhí beirt ag siúl chuig an mbád agus chuaigh an taoide os cionn balla na céibhe agus thar na daoine sin. Ba éasca go dtitfeadh duine isteach san fharraige mar gheall air sin. Tá sé fíor-chontúirteach. Gealladh céibh nua in 2015 agus táim ag impí ar an Aire anois é seo a phlé lena chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Humphreys, agus a cinntiú go bhfuil an t-airgead ar fáil agus go dtógtar an céibh nua sula ngortófar duine go dona nó níos measa fós, go maraítear duine. The Minister has no excuse. He must speak to his colleague, Deputy Humphreys, and make sure that this development happens.	spk_257
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-02-03	dail	33	Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020: Motion	dbsect_16	Mar is eol don Aire, tá muidne i Sinn Féin tar éis tacú le fanacht agus dul chun cinn an EWSS go dtí an 31 Márta. Tuigimid cé chomh tábhachtach is atá an scéim seo i gcomhair na ndaoine atá ag brath ar an airgead seo. Ar ndóigh, an rud atá mé féin chun caint faoi ná na daoine sin atá ag iarraidh morgáiste a fháil agus nach féidir leo mar gheall go bhfuil siad ar an scéim seo. Impím ar an Aire labhairt leis na bainc faoi seo mar is rud uafásach é do na daoine sin nach bhfuil in ann morgáiste a fháil mar gheall air sin. I raise the issue of those who are being refused a mortgage as a result of accessing the EWSS. I first point out that we in Sinn Féin welcomed the extension of the existing rate of the EWSS until 31 March. We welcomed it on the basis that it would provide continued support and much-needed certainty for workers and their employers amid continued level 5 restrictions. We believed that was absolutely necessary. Sinn Féin has been constructive in the operation of the wage subsidy schemes. We sought to ensure increased rates for low-paid workers and for the inclusion of women returning from maternity leave under the TWSS. That is, of course, extremely important. We consistently argued for increased rates under the new EWSS when it was first introduced in September. We felt it was clear that wage supports will be necessary for some time to stave off the scourge of unemployment and their design will, of course, require ongoing consideration and the slow roll-out of the vaccine has further underlined that necessity. Having said that, however, we in Sinn Féin also recognise that the money spent on the TWSS, as well as on the PUP and on the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, has been massive State subsidies to a private sector comprising households and businesses. These State subsidies have been supported by Sinn Féin because we see them as serving the greater good. They have managed to keep many people who would otherwise be out of work connected to their employers. They have kept many businesses going that would otherwise have been liquidated. They have also allowed borrowers - individuals and corporate customers alike - to continue making repayments. That is why I find it so shocking and deeply concerning that some lenders and brokers are still refusing to accept an application for a mortgage from somebody who is on the EWSS. I find it incredible that this could be allowed. An awful lot of constituents have contacted me. We know how precarious the housing situation is; I am sure I do not need to tell this Chamber how difficult it is for many people, and those in Galway city are no exception to that rule. Numerous constituents have come to me because they have found themselves in this situation. They have asked me what they can do and there is very little that can be done when one person in a couple is on the EWSS and the couple simply cannot get a mortgage although all their ducks are in a row. They are now facing a situation where they will be unable to stay in their rented accommodation and are facing homelessness because they simply cannot get mortgage approval. We need to remember that the State remains the key player in the financial sector, just as it is now a key player in the labour market in general.In case the Government needs reminding, in the financial sector it holds a majority stake in both AIB and Permanent TSB to the tune of 75% and it holds a 14% stake in Bank of Ireland. I cannot think of any other shareholder with such a major stake that takes this kind of hands-off approach. It is clear that the restrictions will last for some time. We are all aware of that, so schemes such as the EWSS will be with us throughout 2021 to support people. We must ensure that the Government addresses the fact that people cannot get a mortgage because they are on the EWSS. I urge the Minister to do that.	spk_289
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-01-28	dail	33	Response of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to Covid-19: Statements	dbsect_6	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire. He will find that, on Galway City Council, it is actually Fianna Fáil councillors who voted against certain public housing being built. I am glad that he wants to hear constructive solutions. I will get straight into them. A report released on Monday by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland stated that the construction cost of two-bedroom apartments in urban areas of Dublin now stands at between €219,000 and €262,000. Despite this, the council's own figures for social housing apartment projects, which are built on council-owned land, show prices averaging between €304,000 and €373,000, which is almost €100,000 more on average. In that report, the society calculates that the professional fees attached to the building of a two-bedroom apartment to be between €18,000 and €21,000 yet Dublin City Council was charged between €44,000 and €54,000 for the professional fees attached to its projects. One does not need to be a chartered accountant to see that something is clearly amiss. People have pointed out that there seems to be collusion between competitors to keep prices high. We need a normal functioning market. The State should be allowed to play its rightful part as a competitor, driving down these prices. Dublin City Council tells us:All our construction projects go through a thorough public procurement process in line with European Union and national regulations. At the end of that process the most economically advantageous tender is selected to carry out the project.This raises the question of for whom is it most economically advantageous. It is not just the cost that is a problem. The reality is that it takes at least 18 months from a council deciding to build public housing to actually being able to deliver it. The timeline for project completions is astonishingly long. Before it could build social homes at Cornamona Court in Ballyfermot, it took Dublin City Council four years to get final stage approval from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage for those 61 homes. For the 30 social homes built at North King Street near Smithfield, it took the council just under four years to get final stage approval from the Department. One of Fianna Fáil's supposed big achievements in the area of social housing was to increase the value of projects eligible for single-stage approval. This was increased from €2 million to €6 million. The increase in the number of houses this has brought about has been minimal and the increase in turnaround time has been negligible. It is quite clear that the procurement process in respect of the provision of social housing has failed. There are ways to address this. The Minister has asked us to outline ways in which this and the delivery of social housing can be improved so here we are. We need a radical overhaul of the procurement process. We need to allow councils to develop long-term relationships with builders. We absolutely need increased competition in the marketplace. We need to look at establishing a publicly-owned construction company. We also need to go back to direct build. This is the kind of realism and honesty that we need in the housing system. We need to fundamentally change the procurement process to deliver social housing and to finally remove the shackles and red tape that is hindering the councils' ability to deliver.  I take issue with what the Minister said earlier about Sinn Féin not wanting houses to be built. In Galway City Council, we have consistently supported the building and delivery of housing at times when Fianna Fáil members of the council did not. I ask an tAire to remove the red tape and to outline directly how he is going to make it easier for councils to fast-track the building and provision of public housing.	spk_435
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-01-27	dail	33	Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (Covid Restrictions Support Scheme) (Percentage Adjustment) Order 2021: Motion	dbsect_11	"Ba mhaith liom tacú le rún mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Ó Dochartaigh, maidir leis an scéim seo a leathnú amach. Tá a fhios againn ar fad, agus athbhreithniú ar an scéim á dhéanamh againn inniu, go bhfuil sé tábhachtach breathnú ar an méid a d'oibrigh an scéim ach caithfimid breathnú chomh maith ar an méid nár oibrigh sé. Ar ndóigh, tá roinnt gnólachtaí ann faoi láthair nach bhfuil i dteideal na scéime seo agus tá sé sin fíordheacair ar na gnólachtaí sin. Tá súil agam go mbreathnóidh an tAire air seo agus go ndéanfar rud éigin faoi mar níl sé sách maith go bhfuil roinnt gnólachtaí amuigh ansin nach bhfuil i dteideal na scéime seo. I support the amendment by my colleague, Deputy Doherty, in respect of expanding this scheme to include those businesses which have not been included in it. I also want to raise my concerns about the scheme. The scheme obviously aims to support businesses during the higher levels of lockdown. For those businesses in receipt of it, the CRSS is undoubtedly an essential source of revenue which is keeping them afloat during these difficult times. However, many businesses are unable to receive payment under the scheme and, as a result, their future viability is on the line. We raised this anomaly with the Minister previously during the course of the Finance Bill and I wrote to him on 5 January to highlight this but, unfortunately, nothing has changed. I was relieved to read over the weekend that the Tánaiste and the Government are deliberating over whether to expand the CRSS. It is high time to stop deliberating and act on this because these businesses are really under pressure. We saw that when the scheme was launched in October, it was expected to cost €80 million per week. However, my colleague, Deputy Doherty, has highlighted that it costs, on average, less than €15 million per week. In other words, the scheme has cost approximately 18% of what was first estimated. Surely, therefore, that means there should be a re-examination of those businesses that have been excluded to this point and which are struggling to keep afloat. These are the businesses which do not have premises. The guidelines on the operation of the Covid restrictions support scheme clearly state that ""a business premises is [the] building, or similar fixed physical structure, in which a business activity is ordinarily carried on."" Therefore, boats, for example, are excluded on the basis that they are mobile. However, boats that work as tourist attractions may appear mobile but, in reality, they are based in a specific place where they provide that attraction and do not move from there. One company based in north Connemara raised this issue with me. I was informed that business was down by 80%. The company is based in a rural area and employs ten people. The latter makes it a key employer for the area. The company is frustrated because while tourist attractions often encourage tourists to visit and stay in specific areas, it feels it has been completely forgotten and is not getting sufficient support to enable it to survive. As the Minister can imagine, there is major concern regarding businesses of this nature and of the rural areas in which they are based, which simply need the jobs they create. This anomaly needs to be addressed and I ask him to fix it as a matter of urgency."	spk_161

Caithfimid anois infheistíocht a chinntiú do chalafort Ros a' Mhíl agus calafort domhainmhara a fhorbairt ansin. Impím ar an Aire geallúint a thabhairt dom inniu go ndéanfar é sin agus go bhfuil sé ar chlár oibre an Rialtais. Is mian liom freisin aird an Aire a tharraingt ar cheisteanna a bhaineann leis an mBanc Porcupine atá san Atlantach amuigh ó Ros a Mhíl. Tá an t-ábhar seo ina chnámh spairne ag iascairí an iarthair faoi láthair. Agus muid ag plé na ceiste seo inniu, níl aon chead ag báid áitiúla ar an mBanc Porcupine, bíodh is nár chaill báid na Breataine fiú cuóta amháin agus go bhfuil siad amuigh ag trálaeireacht faoi láthair. An féidir leis an Aire míniú go dtarlódh sé seo? Cén fáth a bhfuil báid áitiúla ceangailte leis an gcé? The fishing community is outraged, and rightly so, at how once again it has been left behind and forgotten. I was glad to see that Ros a' Mhíl was designated as a port that would allow for Northern and British fishing boats to land their catch. The previous decision not to allow this was ludicrous and it is good that a sensible decision has been reached. We urgently need to invest properly in Ros a' Mhíl and act on the development of a deep water quay. I am asking the Minister to commit to that now.  I also want to raise the very concerning issue of the Porcupine Bank off Ros a' Mhíl. Fishermen have contacted me on this. While we are discussing this, the Porcupine Bank is closed to local boats while British boats did not lose a single prawn quota and are now trawling for prawns. How can it happen that local boats are currently tied up?  There is also great concern among those who fish pelagic. They have lost a large percentage from their quota, far more than other countries, and this is crippling the fishing community. It affects the entire community; not only the fishermen themselves but local shops, the people who fix the boats and every element of the local economy. We are looking for renegotiation of the common fisheries policy to get a much better deal for Irish fishing communities. Will the Minister commit to that?	spk_288

I commend the bravery and courage of survivors and families who came forward in the pursuit of truth and who shared very personal and traumatic stories of this deplorable chapter in our country’s history. This report found little evidence that politicians or the public were in any way concerned about the children or mothers in the homes, despite the horrific level of infant mortality. I again pay tribute again to the survivors’ determination, bravery and courage in fighting to ensure that their voices are finally heard. Like several of the reports that have come before us, this report must prompt the Government to act urgently to ensure the human rights of survivors are protected and that their voices are at the very centre of the Government’s response. Survivors’ voices have been ignored for far too long, and it is high time to let these survivors know that they were never at fault. The narrative that society was as much to blame as the church and State is incomprehensible. Society does not collectively decide to banish its women to cruel institutions unless powerful and influential forces such as the State and church facilitate such actions. It is very clear from this report that there is potential for criminal investigation, and this must be examined. The Government’s next steps are very important, and these must include survivors being able to access their own records and data, including their own birth certificates and adoption files, dedicated counselling, financial redress, therapy and other supports. This process could be started by legislation that was published by my colleague, Deputy Funchion, yesterday which would give adopted people a legal right to obtain a copy of their own birth certificate. This is a crucial step in actively dealing with the requests of survivors. How we move forward must be about survivors and their families. We cannot lose sight of the fact that the publishing of this report was and still is very distressing and upsetting for survivors. The true worth of a compassionate Government is measured in how it treats those who it has grown gravely wronged. I urge this Government, please, not to be found wanting at this critical moment.	spk_149
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-01-14	dail	33	Covid-19 (Education): Statements	dbsect_6	I want to raise with the Minister the issue of children with severe to profound intellectual disabilities who attend Rosedale School. The children in question have lost everything. They have nothing. Their worlds have shrunk. One mother described to me how her daughter’s world has shrunk to a bubble in her head. While I welcome the announcement by the Minister, parents have told me that children with severe to profound intellectual disabilities deserve better. Currently, there is no appropriate education plan in place for these children. Children with these needs are the only ones who do not have such a plan at the moment, which is, as far as their parents are concerned, discrimination once again. Parents have described Rosedale School as their lifeline. It is their children's world. It provides their children with so much happiness. All of the children's needs are incorporated into the education plan within the school setting. Parents are deeply concerned about the effect this closure and the previous closure have had on their children. The children of Rosedale had been out of school and have had their critical specialised services withheld. The reality of this is no education, physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, psychological support, friends, hope or light at the end of the tunnel. These children have no comprehension of what is happening and their parents have no way of explaining it to them. The children have no way of putting their frustration across. This frustration stems directly from confusion, uncertainty and change in routine. I raised the issue of these children with the Minister's predecessor in June. I stated that the parents were deeply concerned that if a second wave hit Ireland, these schools would be closed again. I asked whether the service could be reclassified as an essential service in light of the fact that the children's needs are more complex and their conditions are far more profound than those of children in other schools. The parents’ greatest fear became a reality last week when they were told that their children's school would not reopen. We cannot allow this situation to happen again. They deserve better. These children understand routine and boundaries. Learning is painstaking and arduous work for them. It has to be consistent and include repetition every single day. Rosedale parents' association needs clarity on whether the school will reopen and what its opening hours will be. There is clearly a knowledge gap about what people perceive the daily lives of a child with a severe to profound disability to be and what the lived experience actually is. For that reason, I will outline a description of the daily reality and let it be on the Dáil record. One mother told me how, before the first school closure, her son, who has autism and a severe to profound intellectual disability, had learned to regulate himself very well. His levels of aggression had significantly decreased. He was starting to interact with his brother more. The incidence of his sobbing bouts had decreased dramatically. Since the closure, each of these achievements has been the subject of a massive step backwards. His levels of aggression have significantly increased. He is vibrating to the point of shaking trying to regulate himself, to the point where he cannot sit with people for more than five to ten seconds. His mother described this as being like an electric current running through his body because his levels of anxiety are out of control. He is no longer interacting with his brother. He finds it hard to be in a room with the family for any length of time. His nanny, who is 65 years of age and without whom this mother would be unable to work, is his childminder. If he cannot hurt either of them, he hurts himself using walls or any surface he can find. His sobbing bouts have increased dramatically, which is the most heartbreaking part. He cannot tolerate his mother being in the room or giving him a hug to comfort him. He sobs in his room while his mother sobs outside the door. This is the reality for the families of children with severe and profound learning difficulties. I ask the Minister to meet with the parents' association of Rosedale and hear their lived experiences, and ensure that these children are never left behind again. I ask the Minister to clarify whether Rosedale School will reopen next Thursday, the number of hours for which it will be open and if she is willing to meet with the parents' association.	spk_101
Mairead Farrell	40	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2021-01-14	dail	33	Covid-19 (Higher Education): Statements	dbsect_8	Le bliain anuas, is minic go raibh mic léinn ó Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh, agus Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, i dteagmháil liom agus iad trína chéile mar gheall ar bhrú airgid, ar fhadhbanna lóistín agus ar an mbrú meabhairshláinte atá orthu de bharr na paindéime seo. Tá a fhios againn ar fad gur buille uafásach a bhí sa phaindéim seo orainn ar fad ach ba bhuille ar leith í ar dhaoine óga. Chaill an t-uafás acu a gcuid phost agus, ar ndóigh, stop a saoil shóisialta. The past year has been difficult for all of us but it has most certainly been a difficult year for young people. I have lost count of the number of students from NUI Galway and Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology who have been in contact with me about the extraordinary pressure they are under. They have told me of the real economic hardship they face and of the real impact it has had on their mental health. Many have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic and the social life that comes with going on to third level education is non-existent. The NUI Galway Students' Union has told me the feeling of isolation has become a major problem for many students. Of course, that is the antithesis of the experience of most of us at university. I have raised with the Minister previously the issue of the repeat fee at NUI Galway. It still has not been rectified. In the middle of a pandemic when youth unemployment is at a height of 19.4%, students are being asked to cough up €295 for an examination that is free almost everywhere else. That is a considerable amount for students and it is not the kind of disposable income that most of them have. I call on the Minister to intervene urgently in this matter now, before we are in a crisis for so many students again. This is not the only disadvantage facing students of NUI Galway. While other universities have made repeat examinations free, they have also extended time for deferrals and made it possible for students to resit examinations even if they have already passed. If a student needs a higher grade, the student can resit for free. This is the case in some universities but not others. The length of examination time has also been increased in some colleges but not others. There should be a unified approach. No one should be academically disadvantaged during this pandemic. When students graduate and join the workforce, they should be on a level playing field. It is unfair that policies at some universities are more favourable while other universities are not made to follow suit. I urge the Minister to consider this and what action may be taken. Of course the cost of accommodation is bad and crippling in Galway city at the best of times. However, during the pandemic this has been exacerbated. One student wrote to me and said that for the summers between college she worked two jobs and saved 80% plus of the money she earned each summer to pay for going through college. She was also in receipt of the SUSI grant. Each time the college year ended she was in debt as the cost of accommodation crippled her year on year. There are plenty of other students in the same circumstances. Of course in Galway, there is an added stress on students since private providers of student accommodation have not returned money that they have been paid, amounting to up to €5,500 for unused accommodation. Again, we need action on this urgently. I received another shocking account from a student nurse who was not being paid as a student nurse. She was unable to work a part-time job. Any money she received from SUSI, which was not much, went straight on rent. Then, when the pandemic hit, she had increased difficulty finding accommodation as people were concerned, naturally, about sharing with a student nurse. She ended up relying on the hardship fund. That is no solution when it comes to students in the private rented sector. A student hardship fund should not be going directly to landlords or on repeat examinations and college fees. We have another issue relating to the €224 levy being paid. Part of it is supposed to be going toward on-site services. It has to be paid. Will the Minister advise on whether he intends to meet private accommodation providers about refunding up to €5,500 to students? What is his view on whether some universities have more lenient policies regarding examinations while others do not? Will he contact NUI Galway regarding the €295 repeat fee?	spk_178
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-12-17	dail	33	Appropriation Bill 2020: Second and Subsequent Stages	dbsect_31	Tá mé ag roinnt mo chuid ama le mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Ó Dochartaigh. Gabhaim buíochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle agus leis an Aire. Tuigim gur Bille fíorthábhachtach é seo chun a chinntiú gur féidir le Ranna Rialtais airgead a chaitheamh ag tús mhí Eanáir agus nach dteastófar Vótaí breise chun é seo a dhéanamh. Tá bunús bunreachtúil leis an mBille seo agus beimid i Sinn Féin ag tacú leis. I understand that there is a constitutional requirement for this Bill, as it legislates for the financial resolutions which includes all the Estimates voted on by the Dáil this year. This year, the figure is €69.7 billion, which reflects the net amount voted by the Dáil, while €87 billion is the full amount allocated. The key to this Appropriation Bill is that it is a constitutional requirement and that it is essential in order to ensure that Departments can spend, come January, and therefore we will be supporting it. The Bill allows for the four-fifths rule, provided for under the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, which means that Departments can spend four fifths of the previous Appropriation Bill without having to wait for a Vote, and if the Bill was not enacted these Departments could not spend. The Bill also allows for capital carry-over, as per the Finance Act 2004. Each Department can carry over 10% of its capital allocation to the next year. This year, I note that the carry-over is 7.4%, which is higher than usual, however that is due to the restrictions imposed this year as a result of Covid-19. Hopefully, next year will see a better year and we will be able to see large-scale capital projects on a regionally balanced basis. As I have raised with the Minister many times, capital investment will be key, not only in dealing with the major cracks in public infrastructure but it will also be a key driver in terms of job creation, as we hopefully move forward out of this crisis. This point is not just being made by me and my party, Sinn Féin, but it is something that has been raised across the political spectrum and by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, the International Monetary Fund and by many others. We have seen large-scale job losses in the State this year, and I think of those families in the lead-up to Christmas, which is a trying financial time for many, made even more worrying at the very uncertain financial future many are facing as we approach 2021. The Covid-adjusted unemployment figures are approximately 20%. We know that capital investment has a positive jobs-multiplier effect, so if we want the economy to bounce back quickly in 2021, it is of the utmost importance that these matters are attended to urgently. We are all aware of badly needed capital investment projects and the deficiencies in our creaking infrastructure, which could certainly use a capital investment boost. Given that we are going to be playing catch-up next year, I sincerely hope that any capital projects that are in train will be fast-tracked and given the appropriate resources, be they housing, healthcare, transport or environmental projects. Ar an deireadh seachtaine bhí mé i gCeantar na nOileán i gConamara le roinnt ionadaithe eile ón gceantar. Tugadh cuireadh dúinn ón ngrúpa gnímh Bóithre Chonamara chun breathnú ar na droichid atá mar infreastruchtúr fíorthábhachtach dóibh siúd atá ina gcónaí sa cheantar sin. Bhreathnaigh muid orthu agus muid i gcurach, rud a thug radharc maith dúinn ar na droichid agus na scoilteanna atá sna droichid. Tugadh le fios dúinn gur níos measa atá na scoilteanna sin ón am céanna an bhliain seo caite. Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil droch-chaoi ar na droichid sin. Tá an droch-chaoi sin orthu le fada an lá ach, faraor, tá siad ag éirí níos measa bliain i ndiaidh bliana mar gheall nach bhfuil an infheistíocht chuí á chur isteach iontu. Impím ar an Aire, agus é ag breathnú ar phlean d’infheistíocht chaipitil, go mbreathnófar ar Chonamara agus an easpa infreastruchtúr atá sa cheantar. Tá sé dochreidte cé chomh contúirteach is atá na bóithre agus na droichid sin. Tá bóthar Chuan na Luinge ardaithe agam sa Dáil seo cheana ach ardóidh mé é arís eile leis an Aire.Rud eile a chuireann as dom ná go bhfuil roinnt áiseanna poiblí ann nach dteastaíonn ach beagán airgid uathu ionas go mbeidh an pobal in ann iad a úsáid agus níl sé sin á chur ar fáil. Is sampla iontach í linn snámha Ros Muc d’áis álainn don phobal atá imithe i léig le roinnt blianta. Is áis í seo ina bhféadfadh páistí ón gceantar an snámh a fhoghlaim ach níl sí ar fáil don phobal. Táim cinnte go bhfuil áiseanna díreach cosúil le linn snámha Ros Muc ar fud fad an Stáit. Tá deis againn i mbliana airgead a infheistiú i gcúrsaí infreastruchtúir chun feabhas a chur ar shaol an ghnáthdhuine. Mar a dúirt mé níos luaithe, tá a fhios againn go gcruthaíonn infheistíocht i dtionscnaimh caipitil fostaíocht, rud a bhéas ag teastáil go géar san am atá romhainn. Níor chóir dúinn dearmad arís eile a dhéanamh ar Chonamara, go háirithe ar bhóithre Chonamara, droichid Chonamara agus áiseanna poiblí Chonamara.  At the weekend I and other representatives in Galway went to the Ceantar na nOileán region of Connemara to look at the very poor state of the bridges in the area. These bridges are a key part of the local infrastructure on which local people rely heavily. I saw the cracks in these bridges and I am deeply disturbed by this. I have previously highlighted in this Chamber the very dangerous nature of roads in Connemara and the need for adequate investment in them. We must use next year as an opportunity to fix these dangerous cracks in our public infrastructure. We must also put sufficient resources into our public amenities. A fantastic example of such a public amenity is the outdoor pool in Ros Muc, which has given much joy to the people of the area over the years, but unfortunately the pool has a number of issues that need to be fixed to make it usable again. This pool would be a fantastic resource and safe amenity for people of all ages, including people learning to swim. As we move from 2020 to 2021, we need to fix the cracks in our infrastructure and ensure we put adequate resources into capital investment projects because we know of the fantastic benefit they have in job creation. We also need to deal with very real cracks in our infrastructure. I hope the roads and bridges of Connemara are not forgotten once more. This year has been a very tough year for us all. We need to regard 2021 as an opportunity to reimagine what this State can be and the role the State can play to provide sufficient housing, a robust healthcare system and public amenities. The restrictions imposed due to Covid-19 in 2020 have given us some time to reimagine what kind of society we want to live in. Let us use that time of reflection to build a better and fairer society for us all.	spk_250
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-12-15	dail	33	Homeless Prevention Bill 2020: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_33	"Gabhaim mo bhuíochas le mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Eoin Ó Broin, as ucht an Bille fíorthábhachtach seo a chur os comhair na Dála. Homelessness and the threat of homelessness is undoubtedly the main issue that I deal with every day in my constituency office. I am sure we have all met people who have received a notice to quit and are unable to find alternative accommodation. Unfortunately, that is the reality in my home city of Galway, where time and again no properties are available in Galway city centre within the HAP limits. There is also limited access to social housing. Seeing the deep worry of these families as they edge closer to the day they must vacate their home never gets easier, nor does the very difficult conversation they have with the local authority when it advises them that if they cannot find alternative accommodation, they will have to come to the local authority office and present themselves as homeless. This is a horror that no family should face but unfortunately it is a reality for many. I will never forget one woman telling me of her heartbreak as she and her little two-year-old son were walking back to the hotel they were living in, and he pointed at the hotel saying ""Home, home."" This family had been in emergency accommodation since the boy was born and over a year later, they are still experiencing homelessness. My heart breaks every time I think of that story. This is not an isolated case but is the reality for many children across the State.  Another woman contacted me today after I told her that we were discussing this issue in the Dáil and she said:I am a lone parent and I always have been. My child has an autoimmune disease and chronic asthma. We have been two months in homelessness and 14 years on housing list. I am going to get incredibly upset saying this, but my child is under intense pressure when going to school due to the stress of being homeless. The impact this has had on my family is absolutely chronic. Everything comes down to trying to keep your child happy… My son is so intelligent and so nice, but how can he be happy when he doesn’t have his health... or a home."	spk_248
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-12-10	dail	33	Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_35	"Mar a dúirt mo chomhghleacaí, cuirimid fáilte roimh chuid den Bhille seo. Is rud fíorthábhachtach é ionas gur féidir leis na AGMs tarlú agus tá sé sin fíorthábhachtach do na daoine atá ag brath orthu. I welcome this Bill, which makes provision for the holding of certain meetings by credit unions via remote access. We have discussed in this Chamber the importance of credit unions being able to hold their AGMs. It is something that has been raised with me by a number of constituents and several credit unions. It makes absolute sense that this is being dealt with now, in light of the very real risk to human life posed by Covid-19. It will allow, by way of amendment to the Credit Union Act 1997, for attendance and voting by proxy at certain meetings. We know the key role that credit unions play in communities. There is a credit union beside the estate I live on and I have been a member of it since I was a very small child. The credit union is a financial centre for many communities. That is especially the case at this time, when we are looking at the possibility of Ulster Bank leaving the market and the closure of many bank branches. When branches close, there is a loss of local knowledge relevant to funding for loans and so on. Local knowledge is key when making decisions on the granting of loans. I have spoken to the manager of a credit union who raised the concern that its AGM, which would usually cost approximately €30,000, with the production of booklets and all that kind of thing, may now carry an additional cost of €5,000 to €8,000 under the provisions in the Bill. It is necessary and important that the AGMs go ahead but it is also important to be aware of such concerns. There is a need to look at the credit union sector in a broader sense. We need to look at what credit unions can do, what activity they might be able to branch into and the very real crisis they are facing. From speaking to staff in several credit unions in recent months, they have made it clear that we can no longer ignore the scale of the crisis facing credit unions. Nor can we ignore the opportunity for the sector to step into the breach if the likes of Ulster Bank were to leave the market and there are ongoing closures of other bank branches. Those closures can have a significant impact on communities. Regulations have been placed on the sector that have put credit unions at a competitive disadvantage relative to the banks. That has stymied their ability to lend and is strangling their ability to give customers the facility to borrow. Lending regulations introduced just a few months ago allow credit unions to lend only 7.5% of their assets for secured loans such as houses, with larger credit unions being possibly allowed to lend up to 15%. This was brought in by the Central Bank as an advancement of regulation. According to the credit union staff to whom I have been speaking, it is far from it. We need to consider whether it might be better for the credit unions to set their own lending limits. That may not be the way to go but we certainly need to look at what they can lend. Obviously there must be limits, but the situation must be looked at because the credit unions feel they are stymied. More than 50% of the consumer credit market is for mortgages.How can credit unions ever offer a real alternative when this restriction is in place? The Central Bank is increasing the risk for credit unions by not allowing them to have more balanced loan books. We hear that credit unions do not have the nature, scale or complexity to offer mortgages. We need to ask whether they could broaden their activities. We know the great impact they have on communities and their local knowledge, which is very important. Draft figures show that credit unions collectively made a surplus of approximately €65 million in the year prior to 30 September. On the other hand, Permanent TSB reported a pre-tax loss of €57 million in the first six months of the year. Ulster Bank is reported to have plunged into loss and may be preparing to exit the market. In a very unfortunate development, Ulster Bank refused to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach to explain its actions and what it intends to do. Credit unions clearly have the capability and capacity to step into the breach. It is great to see community-led organisations that can help their local communities.  Credit unions are also at a competitive disadvantage with regard to the regulations governing their investments. The foreword of the Central Bank's feedback statement to its consultation paper on potential changes to the investment framework for credit unions stated: ""We are strongly of the view that lending and the provision of services to members should be the key drivers of sector viability"". It notes that revised investment regulations would necessarily impact on the level of return. The Central Bank thus acknowledges that investments by credit unions are safe, but they are still unable to hold the same reserves for investments as for loans. That has a real impact on ordinary people. Furthermore, I refer to the share caps credit unions are obliged to implement. A credit union in the south of Dublin has restricted members' holdings to €20,000. Another one in north Dublin has restricted its members' holdings to €15,000. Members are unable to access a mortgage through their credit unions, while a young person cannot save for a deposit on a house with their local credit union. That is quite concerning, because credit unions can have a great relationship with their customers.  My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, mentioned IFAC and the proposed third term for members. That is a concern. IFAC has served us well, and this is not a reflection on any of its members. However, a limit of two terms was set for a reason. We should stay within those limits.  This Bill is welcome. We need to examine the credit union sector and its potential. The Minister of State has previously spoken of the importance of the sector, but we have not seen bang for our buck in that regard. We need to look at what credit unions can do, especially in light of the large number of bank branch closures. The credit union sector has always been very good to its members and has always exemplified that favourite word, ""prudence"". Credit unions have always been very careful. We need to support them however we can and they are currently telling us that they are facing a huge crisis."	spk_241
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-12-08	dail	33	National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) Act 2019: Motion	dbsect_14	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire as an méid a dúirt sé ansin. Tuigimid ar fad gur in amantaí eisceachtúla a táimid mar gheall ar an bpaindéim. Bhí dea-scéal mar gheall ar an bpaindéim inniu le daoine ag fáil an vacsaín don chéad uair. Tá súil againn ar fad go gciallóidh sé sin go mbeidh deireadh ag am éigin leis an bpaindéim seo. This motion authorises the Minister for Finance, in accordance with section 6(1) of the National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) Act 2019, not to pay the prescribed amount of €500 million into the national surplus reserve fund for 2020. This relates to the much-vaunted rainy day fund that was established by Fine Gael to burnish its image as a prudent manager of the public finances. It was also championed by Fianna Fáil in an attempt to restore trust in its ability to manage the public finances after it torpedoed the economy a decade ago. Despite being established in June 2019, three years after it was promised in the programme for Government, it still has not got off the ground and no money has been transferred from the Exchequer to the fund since it was established. Indeed, this same motion was brought before the Dáil on 17 December last year. The only resource that has been transferred to the fund is the €1.5 billion, as the Minister indicated, that was transferred from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund. This was a case of simply reshuffling resources from one account into another. That €1.5 billion has since been drawn down in response to the Covid-19 crisis, which was the right thing to do. The motion before us proposing not to transfer €500 million to the national surplus reserve fund is also the right thing to do. For that reason, Sinn Féin will support the motion.Over the past year, the Covid crisis has brought unprecedented challenges to our health service, to our economy, as well as to the jobs and incomes of our people. It hardly goes without saying that 2020 will go down as an exceptional year in the history books. Not since the Spanish flu has the world been gripped by a global pandemic of this kind. It is only right and proper that the State brings all financial resources to bear as we combat this virus, attempt to regrow the economy, assist those who have been left without work since March, along with those businesses struggling as a result of this pandemic. Today we glimpsed the light at the end of the tunnel with the roll-out of the vaccine in the North. It is a day of great hope and relief to see vaccines being rolled out. Today, Irishwoman Margaret Keenan, a grandmother of 90 years who lives in Coventry, became the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer Covid-19 jab following its clinical approval. I certainly am looking forward to the opportunity to take the vaccine and to return to normal life, hopefully, as soon as possible. I hope we see the timely, efficient and equitable roll-out of the vaccines with appropriate staffing levels in the centres for dispersing them. I also hope these centres will be accessible for both rural and urban dwellers alike. We must continue, however, to put resources into contact tracing if problems were to arise. It is important we ensure all information about the vaccine is conveyed to the public in as a clear, concise and comprehensive way as possible. Since the beginning of this crisis, Sinn Féin has said the Government must act fast and do whatever it takes to save lives, protect incomes and support our economy. Only by taking radical action can any long-term damage to our economy be avoided. Sinn Féin took issue with the provisions of the legislation which established the national surplus reserve fund. Section 9 of the legislation allowed for the fund to be used to transfer Exchequer resources to the banking sector, a provision we opposed at the time. We submitted amendments to ensure the fund would be invested in infrastructure, housing and capital infrastructure in our health service. Those amendments were rejected at the time. The Minister referred to the importance of capital investment in these times. Today, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, referred to the importance of capital investment in order for us to build our way out of this crisis. This crisis has really laid bare the weaknesses in our health system, our childcare sector and our social safety net. The best response to crisis is a preventive response, ensuring resilience in order that our economy and society are well placed to respond to challenges when they arise. For Sinn Féin, our resilience is undermined by the deficiency in our health service and the serious failures of our housing system. These failures have been exacerbated by the impact of Covid-19. These challenges must be addressed to enhance the resilience of economy and society, ach, mar a dúirt mé ag an tús, táimid chun tacú leis an rún seo. Tuigimid go bhfuil sé fíorthábhachtach go mbeidh aon airgead atá ar fáil don Stát in úsáid chun déileáil leis an bpaindéim seo agus chun cinntiú go mbeidh tacaíocht ag gnólachtaí agus ag daoine ar fud fad na tíre.	spk_168
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-12-08	dail	33	Organisation of Working Time (Domestic Violence Leave) Bill 2020: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_33	Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le mo chomhghleacaithe, na Teachtaí McDonald agus O'Reilly, as an mBille fíor-thábhachtach seo a chur os comhair na Dála. Dá n-achtófaí an Bille seo, thabharfadh sé ceart reachtúil ar shaoire oibrithe maidir le foiréigean baile agus tá sin fíor-thábhachtach. I thank my colleagues, Deputies McDonald and O'Reilly, for tabling this important Bill. I am delighted to see that the Government will support it. This is an issue that we can all say has reached pandemic proportions in Ireland. According to Safe Ireland, one in four women has experienced physical or sexual abuse by a partner or non-partner since the age of 15. We also know that abused women are twice as likely to experience chronic physical health conditions as non-abused women. Victims also report higher levels of depression, anxiety, stress disorders, eating disorders and self-harm, and the list goes on. This shows how essential this legislation will be. I can speak about my constituency, Galway West. The local domestic abuse support services have been vocal about the fact that they are still open. We need to make it known that they are still open. People are concerned about this given the pandemic but it should be clear that these services are available to provide support. We learned at a joint policing committee meeting this week that there has been an increase in the number of barring orders. The Garda has made it clear that it is willing to help. This legislation is extremely important because it will enable victims to take time off work when they need to do so to seek support, find accommodation or attend court. We have seen similar measures introduced internationally, for example, in New Zealand, Australia and certain parts of Canada. It is high time that we did it too. It is upsetting that at a time when we are all asked to stay at home, home for some people, unfortunately, is not a safe place. We need to ensure we provide all the supports we can and send a strong message from the House tonight that we are all on the side of the victims of domestic abuse.	spk_280
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-12-03	dail	33	Finance Bill 2020: Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage	dbsect_32	I echo the sentiments of Deputy Doherty. I am concerned. We had a lengthy debate on Committee Stage in this regard. I was quite surprised at this amendment because I am concerned it could lead to this section not being implemented for a long time. When we had the discussion on Committee Stage, it was our understanding that it would come into effect on 1 January 2021. I have been concerned about the perceived weakness of this. Even with the enactment of the Bill, there could still be possible arbitrage opportunities in this regard. I would like the Minister to clarify this further. We have consensus that this needs to be enacted and I would be deeply concerned if this leads to it not being enacted.	spk_284
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-12-03	dail	33	Finance Bill 2020: Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage	dbsect_32	I will be speaking in support of amendments Nos. 72, 76 and 77. It is very clear that we are in a climate emergency and we need to act now. We need strong decisive action and leadership by the Government to deal with this climate emergency but we need progressive policies if we want to deal with this it. I am deeply disappointed at the regressive nature of the carbon tax. I spoke at length about it on Committee Stage but I want to again highlight my anger at the regressive nature of it. Simply put, this is a regressive tax and the ESRI has been very clear that it will hit low income households most as well as single parent households. That is wrong, and I do not know how the Minister can stand over that. On Committee Stage, I found it particularly ironic that we debated this just before we discussed excise exemptions for NATO. We know that war is a massive pollutant and extremely bad for the environment but we are not discussing that; we are discussing the carbon tax. I made the point on Committee Stage that if the Minister is to push this we will see increases in carbon tax until 2030. His argument against my argument was that in this year's budget we are seeing increases that will make it okay in terms of social welfare and so on but I said that if we have to commit to increases in carbon tax we should also have equivalent increases in social welfare every year to offset the negative, regressive nature of this tax. I stand by that assertion and I believe that is what is needed if the Minister and his colleagues in government continue to pursue this regressive tax. I want to add my voice to those of numerous speakers regarding the major impact this regressive tax will have on rural Ireland. We, and the Government, need to realise what many other speakers stated. People want to use public transport. They know it is good for the environment. It can be a lot less stressful way of going from one place to another than having to drive oneself but the reality is that public transport is not available in rural Ireland and when it is available it is at a massive cost compared even to city buses. I live in a city. There is a bus stop beside my house in Mervue. I am very lucky to have it but the reality is that the people living in Carraroe, in Connemara, have a totally different reality when it comes to public transport. If they want to use public transport to go to work, they may forget about it. They will not get there on time. If they ever get there it will probably cost them half a day's wages. We will push amendment No. 72 to a vote. This is a regressive tax.

Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-12-02	dail	33	Pay for Student Nurses and Midwives: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_2	I commend Solidarity-People Before Profit on bringing forward this motion. It is scandalous that student nurses are not paid at the best of times. It is even more outrageous in the middle of a global pandemic. These student nurses have been central to our front-line response to this pandemic but have been left in financial hardship by the Government. Many students nurses from Galway have contacted me telling me how hard they have had it. One woman told me:I have done 15 weeks unpaid placement each year. This consists of three 12-hour shifts each week, a total of 36 hours a week. The weeks when I have been on placement were extremely difficult. As the placement is unpaid, I also worked in the hospital at the weekends as a HCA through an agency. The shifts at the weekends were also 12 hours and some weeks I would work 60 hours in the hospital only to be getting paid at the weekends as a HCA. The only time these students receive any financial support is when they work outside of the area that their college is in. That consists of €50 year a week to cover accommodation. One would not get accommodation with that in many places. For many, that does not even cover the cost of transport, let alone accommodation. One woman told me the best accommodation she could get beside her placement was for €85 a night. This is not even paid weekly but paid weeks later. It is only available if one travels a certain distance from college. Accordingly, in many cases students have been forced to commute from home due to Covid-19 and they receive nothing as this their placement is near the college. Another nurse told me:While in my third year, I had placements in Roscommon. The €50 a week did not even cover my train ticket - the bus would not get me there on time. I was getting up at 5.30 every morning because I could not stay up there. The pandemic means that many student nurses cannot work their part-time job because of the risk of infection. How can they support themselves if they have no income? Some of them have children. How are they supposed to support their families? This is having an untold impact on their health. One woman told me:Each time I have been put on clinical placement, I have been forced to work 54-hour weeks, 32 hours unpaid on a placement in the hospital and 22 hours in my weekend job. I cannot explain how many times I have considered dropping out because I cannot handle the financial stress. The Minister of State needs to act urgently.	spk_11
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-12-02	dail	33	Finance Bill 2020: Report Stage	dbsect_19	I echo the words of my colleague, Deputy Doherty, about all the assistance that was given in the smooth running of the discussion on the Bill on Committee Stage. It was my first Finance Bill.I thought it ran very smoothly because of the great work put in by a lot of people. I also thank them for that. It has been said that we had a very lengthy debate on the scheme, and I expressed my views on it. I think that this scheme is inflationary and does not benefit the people it is supposed to benefit - the first-time buyers. In reality, its inflationary angle means that it helps the developers and the banks rather than those who are trying to save to buy their first homes. From what previous speakers have said, we know that more than 40% of those who have availed of the scheme were already in a position to buy their homes. Therefore, we know that it is poorly targeted and does not really help the intention of the scheme. That alone should have cast doubt on the scheme in general. I do not see the purpose of continuing it. I hope we get support for having a report. The report would detail all the effects of the scheme. If the Government feels differently and believes the scheme is very beneficial, why not have a report and let it prove what it really does? I support the amendment.	spk_201
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-12-02	dail	33	Finance Bill 2020: Report Stage	dbsect_19	We are stating very clearly that we do not believe the help-to-buy scheme is doing what it is supposed to do or what it says on the tin, so to speak. It is not helping those who need it most or who are looking to buy a house for the very first time. It was mentioned earlier that we believe there is a need for proper social or public housing as well as a proper affordable housing plan, which we have yet to see. The reality is that where I am from in Galway city, there was a ten-year period in which not a single unit of public housing was built. The repercussions are that people have now been on the social housing waiting list in Galway city for 15 years and have never been offered a home. We need to act urgently on this housing crisis. The Government has a scheme that we do not believe is helping people so we are asking for a report on it. The Minister disagrees, which is fair enough, but we are still asking for an investigation into whether we are correct in saying the scheme is not doing what it is supposed to. I urge the Minister to allow that report to go ahead.	spk_206
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-12-02	dail	33	Finance Bill 2020: Report Stage	dbsect_19	"I move amendment No. 9:In page 11, after line 34, to the following:
            We know that rents are extortionate and unsustainable for so many ordinary workers and families, as mentioned in a previous contribution. We know there is a huge cohort of people - I am speaking especially of my age group - who have had to move back home. I know many couples who have had to move back in with their respective parents while they struggle to save to try to get a mortgage. The help-to-buy scheme we talked about earlier does not help. We really need to address this. We need to address the whole issue of rents. This amendment is a proposal to put money back into the pockets of renters and to give that little bit of support to those who have been struggling for so long trying to rent. We have been told it is unsustainable to pay over 30% of one's income on rent and we know fine rightly that in this State the very unfortunate reality is that that percentage is far higher for most people who are renting. In my home town of Galway city rents are extortionate and people cannot pay them. A huge cohort of people fall outside the criteria to qualify for any kind of financial assistance from the State to pay these rents. They simply cannot afford their rents. We need to do something about this. We need to put money back into these renters' pockets. I urge the Minister to consider this amendment and to consider providing the report called for in it."	spk_245
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-12-02	dail	33	Finance Bill 2020: Report Stage	dbsect_19	I think this would be an extremely effective way of putting money back into renters' pockets. We have a huge issue, in particular in our cities, of sky-high rents, and I do not see the measures the Government has introduced having a significant effect on those people who come to my weekly clinics telling me they cannot afford their rents and asking me what they can avail of and what can be done. I say to them there is nothing out there to help them when they are struggling and trying to pay their rent month after month. This measure, in my view, would be an effective way of dealing with this, and I ask the Minister to take another look at it.	spk_247
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-12-02	dail	33	Finance Bill 2020: Report Stage	dbsect_19	Of course I want to see houses being built. I want to see public housing and affordable houses being built. I want to see an affordable housing plan. As I stated earlier to the Minister, there was a ten-year period during which not one social house was built in Galway city. That is the reality with which we are dealing. The fact of the matter is that a significant number of people are renting because of bad housing policy decisions by Government after Government. That is the reality. We do want to see a big housing build plan, but what will we say to the people who need to pay their rent this month, next month and the month after that? What will we say to those who are struggling, month after month, to pay their rent? This is not something the Opposition has made up. All Members know that many people simply cannot afford to pay their rent. The amendment asks for a report to be prepared. The Minister stated that he does not agree that a relief such as that suggested in the amendment should be brought in. Let us see the report and discover what impact it would have. I do not see why he is not agreeing to have a report prepared in order to let us take a look at the issue. The reality of the matter is that it is not sustainable to continue putting that significant financial stress on families and young workers. It is wrong. I encourage the Minister to think about that again and to support the preparation of a report to examine this issue.	spk_255
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-12-01	dail	33	State Pension Age: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_35	I commend my colleagues, Deputies Louise O'Reilly and Claire Keranne, on bringing forward this important motion. Throughout people's working lives, they knew the pension age always to be 65 years.More than that, people were mentally geared up to retire at 65. The social contract which the State had with its citizens was broken by the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government when it brought into law increases in the pension age to 66 in 2014, to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. It was a cruel twist of the knife in the backs of those who had worked all their lives, paid their taxes and followed the rules, only to be shafted in their autumn years. We see now that this law crafted by a Labour Party Minister is being stopped in its tracks, but only temporarily. We must now restore the broken social contract and remove the cruel unfairness from the future of our senior citizens. When the pension age was first moved from 65 years old to 66, it was claimed that this was for budgetary reasons and financial hard times. Public service sector pay was also impacted at this time. Despite improvements in the economy, however, there was no talk of changing the pension age back to 65. Not only that, but it happened at the time when the Government also raided the private pension fund, which brought about a double whammy against older people who had worked all their lives trying to save for retirement. The Government put its hands in people's savings. One constituent wrote to me to say a massive lack of respect had been shown to people who had stayed at home and helped to build the economy through the bad economic times. It must be remembered that during the 1980s there were high income taxes and that during the crash of 2008 people like me were requested to take pay cuts, the universal social charge, USC, was introduced and part of our private pension fund was raided.  The reality is that our pension age of 66 is two years above the EU average of 64, despite us having nearly 30% fewer older people than other EU countries. In 2016, we spent 8% of our national income on public pensions, and this is to rise by less than 3% over the next 50 years, with us spending less on public pensions than most eurozone countries. Several months ago, an older man in my estate in Mervue in Galway city told me he had been working since he was 16 years old. He told me was in his 60s now, having worked all his life and he was being told, as he put it, by politicians in comfortable seats that he would have to continue to work for a few more years or go on to jobseeker's allowance. That man told me that had been running up and down ladders and doing hard physical labour. He had enjoyed it, made great friends and achieved a comfortable life for his family, but he said that he could not keep doing that now, because that level of physical labour takes its toll. The Minister is now asking that man to go on the jobseeker's allowance.	spk_268
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-11-24	dail	33	Regulation of Lobbying (Amendment) Bill 2020: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_42	"I move: ""That the Bill be now read a Second Time."" Tá mé an-sásta an Bille seo a chur os comhair na Dála. Tá an Bille fíorthábhachtach don trédhearcacht agus chun a chinntiú go bhfuil an Dáil ag obair ar son na ndaoine. I am delighted to move what is my first Bill in the Dáil alongside my colleague, Deputy Doherty. The topic of public standards goes to the heart of a well-functioning democratic system. The corollary of this is that poor public standards lead to a poorly functioning democratic system. Recent months alone have shown the need for increased regulation of lobbying. The Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, has long been calling for this and urgent action is needed. I hope to have cross-party support because I believe that the enacting of this legislation would be the sensible thing to do. In fact, it would be the commonsensical thing to do. I am disappointed that the Government's amendment seeks a further review, this time of section 22, in what seems to be a case of the Government pushing the Bill I am presenting down the road. There was a review in 2016 and another in 2019. We do not need another. We need action. This is not rocket science. It is a clear and straightforward way of dealing with a problem that we as politicians face. It is time that the Dáil called ""Stop"" on the revolving door between political life and lobbying activities. That revolving door may have served the self-interest of some former Ministers, but it has not served the public's interest. A revolving door between politics and the lobbying industry is corrosive to democracy and undermines the public's confidence that our political system is responsive to people's needs rather than those of unelected vested interest groups. This Bill would change that. When reviews of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 took place, SIPO, the body that ensures standards in public office, made recommendations to strengthen its hand when dealing with breaches of the Act. Our Bill would implement 13 of the 22 recommendations made by SIPO to the Government in 2019. Some of them would broaden the scope of the Act, some would make definitional changes and some would enact new provisions. The Bill would increase from one to two years the length of the so-called cooling-off period that Ministers, Ministers of State, special advisers and high-ranking civil servants must wait before moving from office to the lobbying sector. This increase would simply be following best practice. People have said that this would interfere with people's right to work, but the Bill contains a provision allowing SIPO to waive or shorten the cooling-off period if it believed a strong enough case had been made. The Bill would also allow SIPO to investigate and sanction breaches of the cooling-off period. What is the point in having such a period if it does not need to be adhered to? Surely the commonsensical thing to do is legislate to close this loophole. The Bill would give SIPO the power to investigate and sanction a person or body that is a lobbyist that avoids his, her or its obligations under the Act. A simple and straightforward way of stopping people from trying to avoid the requirements of the legislation would be to have an anti-avoidance provision. It would make sense and is what is contained in the Bill. The Bill outlines clearly that a designated public official must cut off contact with a person who has failed to comply with the registration of lobbying activities. Not only that, but the official would need to inform SIPO in writing. If SIPO became aware of a non-compliant person or body, it could tell a designated public official that he or she must cease all communication with that entity. It would be for SIPO to decide for how long that would apply. This is a clear and straightforward way of dealing with breaches of the Act. The Bill would require compliance with the code of conduct by people carrying out lobbying activities whereas the Act only requires them to have regard to it. Importantly, SIPO would have the power to conduct inquiries into reported breaches. The Bill is urgently needed in the interests of accountability and transparency. There is no point in suggesting that we must wait for another review and take another look at the issue in a number of months' time. Let us bring the Bill to Committee Stage, have a thorough discussion on it, finally give SIPO the powers it has been calling for since 2016 and work together to shut the door between government and vested interests."	spk_472

I welcome this debate and the fact that not one Member of the Oireachtas has opposed this. I am delighted that we have drafted legislation that goes across the political divide, with representatives agreeing that these changes must take place. I am also glad that this Bill will go to Committee Stage, although it will take another nine months if the Government's amendment passes tomorrow. The importance of this legislation and the public need for these changes has meant that we have not had a dissenting voice. That speaks loudly by itself. I welcome what the Minister said earlier, that he will be extending the review and not just focusing on section 22. I believe that we need to act on this right away and I suggest that the next step is pre-legislative scrutiny. If the Government lets it pass to pre-legislative scrutiny, then we are willing to work with the Government and it would not go any further while the Government is conducting that review. I ask the Government to consider that. I thank my Sinn Féin colleagues who have supported this tonight, as well as other Deputies across the House.

Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-11-24	dail	33	Regulation of Lobbying (Amendment) Bill 2020: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_42	Is that correct or not? That is absolutely correct. I want to go back to tonight's Bill. This should not be delayed any further. We saw a review in 2016 and we saw the SIPO recommendations. There was a review in 2019 and there were SIPO recommendations, but nothing was done. Fine Gael ignored it in 2016 and again in 2019. In February this year, Fine Gael again ignored it. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published its review, which called for more education and guidance as, apparently, there was no convincing case for updating these laws.Following this, SIPO released a statement stating that it was disappointed that none of its recommendations to enhance transparency and accountability were adopted. Since then we have seen major incidents which show the drastic need for change with regards to lobbying in this country. Another matter upon which I have written to the Ceann Comhairle, and I was grateful for his reply, is in respect of something that has been mentioned here earlier during this debate and concerns the fact that a former Member does not require an invitation to the Dáil for the purposes of lobbying. They can just use their swipe card to come and go as they please whereas another organisation, without that so-called privilege, would require an invitation. That is complete madness and once again creates an inequality and an elite which needs to change. Nobody, after having been elected to the Dáil, should get some sort of privilege which gives them greater access than another person when they leave this office.  We now have a situation where the Government wants another review. I urge the Minister to take on board the consideration that we discuss this further and let this Bill be brought further than this today. The question is why. We have already had two reviews and SIPO’s recommendations on what additional powers it requires. What we have not had is a proper enactment of the kind of recommendations that have flowed from these reviews.  Deputy Shortall said earlier that we need so much more anti-corruption measures. I see this Bill as a first but very important step in that regard. I would like us to work together to bring about those recommendations because they are essential, even just for public confidence in political life, which is so important. The last thing we need now is another can-kicking exercise which tries to avoid taking any actions by riding out the current news cycle and hoping that the public will forget all about this.  We need immediate action and to close the revolving door between vested interests and government and not more grease on the wheel. Unfortunately, it is the public who are left to carry the cost of this influence-peddling as our democratic process becomes corroded. We have a very reasonable Bill here that will deal with this and we are willing to work with the Minister on it. I urge him to reconsider his position to allow us to move this Bill on to pre-legislative scrutiny. Gabhaim buíochas.	spk_502

I am seeking leave to introduce the Regulation of Lobbying (Amendment) Bill 2020, along with my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty. I will give a brief explanation of what the Bill entails and why I believe it is necessary. The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to a number of the changes that the Standards in Public Office Commission has called for in order to increase its powers of investigation and sanction around the area of lobbying. These changes are called for in its legislative review in May 2019. The Bill will seek to amend the principal Act, namely, the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015. There are nine sections in the Bill. Section 1 is an interpretation and defines the principal Act as the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015. Section 2 is an amendment to section 11 of the principal Act. Under the Act, a representative body is only within the scope of the Act if it has one or more full-time employees. Subsection (1) amends the definition of a representative body to cover those representative bodies that exist primarily to advocate on behalf of their members which do not have full-time employees. This section also widens the definition of representative bodies to capture informal coalitions of business interests where same have been formed to lobby as a group of mutual industry interests. Subsection (2) increases transparency in respect of lobby activities by requiring the members of a body coalition to be named in returns.This section gives effect to recommendation 1 of SIPO's submissions of May 2019. Section 3 amends section 11 of the principal Act. Sections 11(1)(c) and 11(1)(d) of the Act require that an application to register must include information and contact information, respectively, about the applicant's business or main activities. Section 11(1)(b), however, includes only a reference to carrying out business but omits any reference to main activities. This section of the Bill will ensure that all appropriate contact information is provided for. For the sake of completeness and consistency, section 11(1)(b) will be brought in line with sections 11(1)(c) and 11(1)(d) by the insertion of the words ""main activities"". This section will give effect to recommendation 8 of Standards in Public Office Commission's submissions of May 2019. Section 4, on duties of designated public officials, will insert a new section into the Act relating to the duties of designated public officials, DPOs. It will provide that where the DPO becomes aware that a person or body carrying out lobbying activity has failed to comply with the registration of lobbying activities, the DPO shall cease all communication with that person or body and inform them of the reason such communication has ceased. Furthermore, the DPO shall inform SIPO of the cessation of communication. Where the commission becomes aware of lobbying activity by a person or body that has failed to comply with the registration provisions of the Act, the commission can direct the DPO to cease communication. Similarly, where the commission becomes aware of lobbying activity by a person or body that has been found guilty of a contravention in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the commission can direct the DPO to cease communication. The commission has the authority to determine the duration of the cessation of communication in these circumstances and can determine when communication may be re-established. This section will give effect to recommendations 18 and 19 of SIPO's submissions of May 2019. Section 5 is an amendment to section 16 of the principal Act. Subsection (1) will amend the Act by directing that persons comply with the code of conduct rather than simply having to have regard to the code. Subsection (2) will amend the Act by giving the commission power to investigate and report on breaches of the code of conduct. The commission may now also consider whether a person or body has complied with the code of conduct when investigating or making a decision to prosecute an offence under section 20 of the Act. Furthermore, an authorised officer appointed under section 19 of the Act shall take into consideration, when carrying out an investigation, whether a person carrying out lobbying activities has complied with the code of conduct. This section also directs the commission to prepare an annual report specifically relating to the code of conduct and a copy of it to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas not later than 30 June in the year following that to which it relates. Subsection (2) will give effect to recommendations 10 and 11 of SIPO's submission. Section 6, an amendment to section 18 of the principal Act, will provide for further contraventions, including failing to follow the direction of the commission in respect of the cessation of communication contravening section 22(1), which provides for the cooling-off period after a DPO leaves office and where a person or body takes an action where its intended purpose is to void or circumvent the obligations imposed by the Act. Section 7 is an amendment to section 22 of the principal Act and will provide for a cooling-off period to be increased to two years. Section 8 is an amendment to section 25 of the principal Act and will give effect to recommendation 15 of SIPO's submissions. Section 9 concerns the Short Title and commencement of the Act. It will provide that the principal Act and the Bill shall be construed together as one Act. It will provide that the Act shall come into operation on such a day or days that the Minister may make by order and that such a day or days shall not be later than 90 days from the date on which the Act is signed into law."	spk_196

Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-11-17	dail	33	National Development Plan	dbsect_47	I completely agree with the Minister. It is extremely important for both sides that we have a deal of this nature because it will provide stability in the delivery of public services in the first instance. Of equal importance is that it will provide a level of justice for workers. Public sector workers have been a significant part of the front-line workforce during this pandemic, as we have often mentioned in this Chamber, and they cannot be left behind. They deserve to have economic security and to know their jobs are not left in a precarious position. I hope the Government does not let this matter slide as it would be neglectful to do so. In this instance, the State is the employer and it needs to deal with it in a timely fashion. My other concern is that during this pandemic, we are greatly relying on the public services and I would hate to see unrest as a result of a failure to reach an agreement. Is the Minister giving a commitment to do everything in his power to ensure a deal is reached?	spk_385

I would also be concerned if a deal is reached at the eleventh hour because we know that such a deal needs to be debated and voted on by all the public sector workers across this State. This is a lengthy process in normal times and it is an even more difficult process in these times. I am wary that we will have a scenario where a deal is done at the last minute when there was time to work on this issue months ago. We have known for years that this agreement would run out at the end of December 2020. I understand that the Minister was only appointed in the summer but he will have been acutely aware that this was coming down the line. It should have been a priority for the Department. These agreements are usually agreed with months to spare because they may not be ratified initially, which means that parties have to come back to the negotiating table. It also means that everyone gets a fair turn of hearing exactly what the situation is. If there was to be a second round of negotiations, it would be unfair for the employer to leave these workers, who have given so much during the pandemic, in such a precarious position."	spk_387

Getting value for money is very important in the area of public procurement. We often hear talk of the supposed cost efficiencies of the market relative to the public sector, yet many of the large cost overruns come from large public procurement capital projects. The national children's hospital is a noteworthy example but 35 out of 38 health and education projects nationwide ran over the agreed contract price, which is an issue the Minister raised during his time in opposition. Given that price is generally the deciding factor in the awarding of contracts for large capital projects, will this review examine abnormally low contract bids or lowball offers with a view to ascertaining whether there is a relationship between successful low-cost tenders and large cost overruns? If such a relationship were shown to exist, this would indicate that increased regulation is also required for low-cost contracts, as such bids could be a precursor to cost overruns.	spk_414

I have raised concerns with the Minister previously about what appears to be a lack of progress on a new deal. This must be prioritised by the Minister and the Government. Will the Minister advise what the status of these negotiations is, the date on which formal negotiations took place and the expected date of their completion?	spk_383
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-11-17	dail	33	Public Sector Pay	dbsect_48	I completely agree with the Minister. It is extremely important for both sides that we have a deal of this nature because it will provide stability in the delivery of public services in the first instance. Of equal importance is that it will provide a level of justice for workers. Public sector workers have been a significant part of the front-line workforce during this pandemic, as we have often mentioned in this Chamber, and they cannot be left behind. They deserve to have economic security and to know their jobs are not left in a precarious position. I hope the Government does not let this matter slide as it would be neglectful to do so. In this instance, the State is the employer and it needs to deal with it in a timely fashion. My other concern is that during this pandemic, we are greatly relying on the public services and I would hate to see unrest as a result of a failure to reach an agreement. Is the Minister giving a commitment to do everything in his power to ensure a deal is reached?	spk_385
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-11-17	dail	33	Public Sector Pay	dbsect_48	"I hear the Minister referring to ""an economic reality"" but the State is the employer in this instance and it is important that it gives some security to these workers. I would also be concerned if a deal is reached at the eleventh hour because we know that such a deal needs to be debated and voted on by all the public sector workers across this State. This is a lengthy process in normal times and it is an even more difficult process in these times. I am wary that we will have a scenario where a deal is done at the last minute when there was time to work on this issue months ago. We have known for years that this agreement would run out at the end of December 2020. I understand that the Minister was only appointed in the summer but he will have been acutely aware that this was coming down the line. It should have been a priority for the Department. These agreements are usually agreed with months to spare because they may not be ratified initially, which means that parties have to come back to the negotiating table. It also means that everyone gets a fair turn of hearing exactly what the situation is. If there was to be a second round of negotiations, it would be unfair for the employer to leave these workers, who have given so much during the pandemic, in such a precarious position."	spk_387

Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-11-11	dail	33	Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2020: Second Stage	dbsect_25	Brexit, the UK Internal Market Bill, the Good Friday Agreement and the future of Irish reunification are on the world stage. Last month, Joe Biden, the incoming President of America, held a campaign event on the Good Friday Agreement, Brexit and the future of Irish reunification. Regardless of his approach to foreign or domestic policy measures or the economy, his keen interest in maintaining the Good Friday Agreement and in Irish reunification is clear and we cannot underscore enough how important his Presidency could be for the cause of Irish unity in a post-Brexit environment. The ousting of Donald Trump means that Boris Johnson has lost his main geopolitical ally. A supporter of Brexit in the White House has been replaced with an opponent of anything that could undermine the Good Friday Agreement or see a hard border in Ireland. As Trump is consigned to the dustbin of history, it seems likely that the same will go for any prospect of a US-UK free trade deal should Johnson go ahead with his controversial internal market Bill. Any move by the Johnson Administration to undermine the Good Friday Agreement will not be tolerated by the incoming US Administration. Nor should it be tolerated by our Government. In the Brexit negotiations, Downing Street has stated that significant differences remain between the two sides. Notwithstanding those differences, it is clear that the ground is beginning to shift quickly beneath the feat of the Johnson Administration. Nicola Sturgeon has already stated that, if the Scottish National Party wins a majority in the Scottish election in six months' time, Scotland will hold another independence referendum. As recent polling has shown, there is now majority support for Scottish independence. Peter Robinson, the former leader of the DUP, has pointed out that an Irish unity referendum is inevitable. Unfortunately, that inevitability seems to have been lost on our Government, especially its so-called republican element in Fianna Fáil. Fianna Fáil is quick to talk about the idea of a shared island, but it is slow to flesh out what that means and, unfortunately, even slower to do anything about it. The Taoiseach has ruled out a unity referendum for the next five years. Given that the Government seems to stagger from one crisis to another, however, five years is a long time. The time for a unity referendum is fast approaching. The reunification of this island gets closer day by day. The arrival of Joe Biden into the White House could easily be the last piece of the puzzle in achieving Irish unity. In former President Bill Clinton's view, his big foreign policy achievement was the brokering of the Good Friday Agreement. It seems likely that a big potential foreign policy win for the Biden Administration would be the conclusion of this work, the end of partition on this island and the reunification of our country.	spk_190

Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-11-04	dail	33	Finance Bill 2020: Second Stage	dbsect_17	"Cuirim fáilte roimh an díospóireacht ar an mBille Airgeadais ach admhaím go bhfuil imní orm faoi chúpla rud sa Bhille seo. Ar ndóigh, táimid á phlé seo le linn ama eisceachtúil agus le linn paindéime, ach mar sin féin, caithfimid déileáil leis na rudaí atá go fíor míchothrom sa Stát seo. There was one thing in this year’s Finance Bill that I admit has caught me by surprise, which is the subsidies for NATO military forces for the exemptions they will receive from 2022 from VAT excise for services and goods. It will be interesting to hear what that actually entails. When I read ""NATO"", at first I wondered if I had read it correctly, as in whether this is the same organisation that was set up to check the Soviet Union, which does not exist anymore? Why would it now need exemptions come 2022? Nevertheless, there seems to be a will that the taxpayers of Ireland, a neutral country, would provide tax subsidies to foreign military forces from an organisation that our country is not even a member of. I would love to know the benefit of giving such a tax subsidy to a military force. I am very interested to see what kind of cost-benefit analysis was done for the State on this. We are aware that there are already massive costs to the State from the exemption of fees for US military flights. According to Shannonwatch, between 2003 and 2019 the cost incurred by the Irish Aviation Authority in exempting fees for en route services for military and other flights was €46 million, the lion's share of which is accounted for by US military flights. Furthermore, in 2016 it was reported that the cost of having the Garda and the Army protect US military planes at Shannon Airport was almost €1.5 million a year. Earlier this year my colleague, Deputy O’Rourke, wrote to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who confirmed that US and other military aircraft traversing Irish airspace or indeed landing in Ireland do not pay air traffic control charges. I would like an explanation as to why Irish taxpayers are now being asked to further subsidise conflict, war and aggression. Where does the drive for this initiative come from? Another aspect of the Bill that concerns me, and which I also referred to on budget day, is that the Government, much like its predecessors, seems to have a housing strategy that continues to rest on the private developer-led model. This has led us into the housing crisis we face today. It has made housing unaffordable for many and has led to sky-high rents and an unprecedented homelessness crisis. The concessionary measures outlined in the Finance Bill are just the further expression of this. Two measures in particular stand out. These are the extension of the disastrous help-to-buy scheme and the loosening of the requirements for developers to avail of the stamp duty refund scheme for residential development. The former scheme, which increases the tax relief for first-time buyers from €20,000 to €30,000, has been inflationary for house prices and it has been poorly targeted. Effectively, it is a subsidy to developers and no doubt this is why the Government has chosen to extend and increase it. It helped to push up property prices, much to the delight of developers, I am sure. There were instances where its introduction pushed up house prices in certain locations by almost €10,000 practically overnight. That is not much use to those who are trying to get onto the property ladder for the first time. Figures have shown that more than 40% of the help-to-buy recipients already had the deposit saved, and therefore it did not help in this regard. One would have thought that the Government would have been concerned about this. A person would have been forgiven for thinking the Government would scrap a scheme where almost half of the help-to-buy recipients did not require what the scheme was intended to do, which was to help. Another gift to developers has been the stamp duty refund scheme for residential development, which allows a refund mechanism to reduce the effective stamp duty rate for qualifying developments to 2%. This is on the condition that these developments are completed in a timely manner within two years. What do we see in this Finance Bill? That requirement has now been pushed back to two and a half years. The developers can avail of the effective 2% rate even if they are now 25% slower in terms of the completion rate. The message is very loud and clear. Instead of giving ever more concessions to private developers, it would be better for the State to break from this neoliberal model and develop a large stock of public housing assets. This is what people need. This is what people in homeless services right now need. This is what people trying to get onto the property ladder need. This is what the Government needs to do."	spk_177
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-11-03	dail	33	Data Protection Act 2018 (section 60(6)) (Central Bank of Ireland) Regulations 2020: Motion	dbsect_18	"The motion relates to regulations which came into operation on 30 October 2019. The Data Protection Act 2018 (Central Bank of Ireland) Regulations 2019 were introduced to permit the rights of data subjects under Articles 12 through 22 and 34 and controllers' obligations under Article 5 of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, to be restricted to the extent necessary and proportionate to allow the Central Bank to perform certain functions. The motion before us today does nothing to change the substance of these regulations whatsoever. In fact, it does nothing more than correct an indentation error which was made in the printing process of the regulations which came into effect in October of last year. The regulations themselves apply to personal data, in respect of which the Central Bank is a controller and which are processed by the Central Bank, in pursuit of what is defined as a ""relevant objective"" and pursued by the Central Bank in carrying out a ""relevant function"". This is defined as an important objective of general public interest, as referred to in the Data Protection Act 2018. These relevant objectives include avoiding obstructions to any official or legal inquiry, investigating or prosecuting breaches of ethics for regulated professions, and taking any action for the purposes of investigating a complaint made to a regulatory body. Under the regulations, the restriction of data subjects' rights or controllers' obligations must be necessary and proportionate. As we all know, the restriction of data is a serious issue which must be justified and justifiable. Are these regulations, which permit the restriction of data access in prescribed circumstances, monitored to ensure the restriction is both necessary and proportionate? The regulations also provide that where data subjects' rights or controllers' obligations are restricted, the Central Bank must notify them in writing, except in very limited circumstances. It also gives the data subject the right to submit a complaint to the Data Protection Commissioner. Will the Minister of State provide an update on the number of such complaints lodged with the Data Protection Commissioner since these regulations came into force last year? The motion before us today is not one of substance but rather a technicality. It is a formatting issue. Having spoken to the Central Bank policy unit in the Department of Finance, I understand that there was an indentation in regulations 3 and 7 of the regulations published last year. The effect of the indentation is quite significant. For example, due to the indentation error, financial services legislation would not relate to the operation of the Central Credit Register. This is the error which the regulations before us today seek to address, specifically by reformatting regulations 3 and 7. I see no issue with these changes but I have some questions for the Minister of State. Has the Central Bank, as a result of this indentation error, restricted data subjects' rights in a way that is in contravention of the regulations published last year? As a consequence, could the Central Bank be open to legal challenge? While I have the opportunity to speak about issues relating to the Central Bank, I also raise the second private motor insurance report, published as part of the national claims information database. Its findings are clear and lay bare the price-gouging activities of the insurance industry. Since 2009, insurance premiums have risen by 35%, despite the cost of claims falling by 9% and the number of claims made falling by 45%. Today's report confirms what we in Sinn Féin have been saying for some time. Premium costs for consumers have gone up while the cost of claims for insurance companies has fallen. Last year alone, the insurance industry recorded profits of €142 million. The Government has failed to rein in the industry and consumers cannot afford inaction any longer.In the next months, my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, will introduce legislation to ban the practice of dual pricing by the industry. What will the Minister of State do about this?"	spk_568
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-10-21	dail	33	Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) Records, and another Matter, Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_13	A total of 798 babies and small children died at the Tuam mother and baby home in my home county of Galway. Many of the babies died because of malnutrition and neglect. They were buried in unmarked graves.The horror of this reality, that 798 small children died in this way and that they were not given the dignity of a marked grave, is something that we, as a State, must recognise, and we must never let this happen again. For those women who took part in the commission the objective was to be fully transparent. They laid their souls on the table in the hope they would finally get truth and justice. They have told us just how painful and traumatic it was to submit their evidence and tell their story. For many it was a reliving of the trauma they had endured in the mother and baby homes. Some have told me that their very personal stories were so horrendous they did not think they would be believed. The mental and physical distress they are going through now, with the potential sealing of their testimonies for 30 years, the fact that once again the State is taking an attitude of locking away their realities, and their truths and lived experiences are being brushed under the carpet, is causing them huge pain. The reason these women took part in the commission was so that the truth would finally be out. I want to quote some of these women that their experiences will be on the Dáil record.Daily life was so bad that I attempted to run away twice with two other girls but they always found us and brought us back. On the second occasion we were caught by the police who returned us to the Convent.I was in terrible pain and was afraid but when I screamed or called for help I was abused.Three weeks ago, one woman said it was her dying wish to see justice. She was buried on the day this was being discussed in the Seanad. Sadly, the State failed her once more but it must not fail other women. The Minister can change this and I urge him to be the Minister who finally recognises that what happened to these women was wrong and to be part of a Government that stands with these women. We must no longer hide from these horrors. The State must face the faults of the past and do better for victims of State-sponsored abuse. This can be done and the Minister can stand on the right side of history and on the side of these women.	spk_238

Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-10-13	dail	33	Budget Statement 2021	dbsect_4	"Long before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, we lived the reality of the impact of budgetary choices made by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael year after year. We had record rents, record levels of homelessness, record numbers on hospital trolleys and record numbers waiting for medical treatment. Too many people were forced to live their lives on the financial edge. Workers and families were barely getting by and were just about paying their bills or mortgages. A generation - and counting - has been locked out of home ownership. These shameful blights on our society did not come about by accident. They happened because every year a Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil Minister has stood up here on budget day and made announcements that define the lives of millions. Unfortunately, they have made those decisions based on the premise that our society should serve our economy and not the other way around. The pandemic has shone a light on the ugly reality of a skewed system in which the needs of banks, mortgage lenders, landlords and vested interests have been prioritised over the needs of workers, families and communities. While no one could have predicted the pandemic, our public services are ill-equipped and under-resourced after decades of neglect. The pandemic has shown us that houses need to be homes, where people can build lives and have a sense of security. Out-of-touch Governments have stood idly by for years. Under their watch, the housing crisis has spiralled out of control and ordinary people have been left to pay the price. This time around, we were told it would be different. ""We are all in this together"" was the mantra, but those days are already a pipe dream. This Government has chosen to slash people’s incomes through cuts to the PUP. Mortgage breaks for hard-pressed workers and families have been scrapped and protections for renters are out the window. We are no longer all in this together, and that is a choice this Government made. Instead of harnessing the strength of unprecedented social solidarity, community and cohesion, it has chosen to take a different road. It has chosen to return to old habits and the economics and politics of division. That is not what our country needs. We need a vision to rebuild, stronger, fairer and better.  In am na héiginnteachta seo, tá ualach oibre fíorthábhachtach faoinár gcúram mar ionadaithe poiblí breith a thabhairt maidir le cén chaoi is fearr airgead poiblí a chaitheamh. Agus muid ag tabhairt faoin obair seo, níor mhór dúinn cuimhneamh gur ar mhaithe le formhór an phobail ba cheart na cinntí seo a dhéanamh. Caithfimid seasmhacht a chinntiú don phobal agus athshlánú eacnamaíoch a chinntiú atá bunaithe ar chothromaíocht agus comhionannas. Caithfimid seasmhacht agus dóchas a chruthú. Ní raibh an oiread tábhacht ag baint le buiséad d'oibrithe agus do theaghlaigh le fada an lá. Níl aon amhras ach go bhfuil comhthéacs na pandéime lárnach do leagan amach an bhuiséid seo.This pandemic has shown that one's home really is one's sanctuary. For too long, a place to call home has been beyond the reach of many. The hard-working couple whose wages just about cover their rent have no chance of saving for a deposit. It is beyond the reach of adults in their late 20s and 30s who are still living with their parents and people living in damp, substandard accommodation who have been on the social housing waiting list for well over ten years with absolutely no end in sight, and a family with young children who are facing another Christmas in a hotel room. Since March, we have all spent more time at home. For some, it has become a new home office and for others, it has been a place to cocoon, but the damning reality is that for many, their home is their greatest cause of concern. There is fear of not being able to meet mortgage repayments since the Government refused to ensure an extension of the mortgage break. There is a worry that a landlord will issue a person with a notice to quit or that the damp and mould really are affecting one's child's health. In this time of great instability, we have never needed the security and stability of a home more. However, once again the Government has failed to grasp the magnitude of this crisis. Is it indifference, ignorance, incompetence or all three? As this is a decade long crisis, it is clear to me that there is no understanding, empathy or political will to provide affordable, decent homes. Fine Gael has presided over the largest increase in homelessness in the history of the State with almost 9,000 people homeless. This should send shockwaves through the Cabinet but it clearly does not as target after target is not met. Last year, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, stressed that the Government has executive authority, controls the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, is responsible for addressing the housing crisis and must accept that its performance on housing has not been good enough, and I wholeheartedly agree. Now the Minister's party is in government and for most people, it is a case of business as usual. He is not going to tackle the problem of affordability. He has allocated just €110 million for affordable homes. He is not going to tackle the lack of public housing including affordable rental. There is almost nothing here for renters. He is going to ensure that the current housing regime which suits landlords, bankers, developers and vulture funds endures. Fianna Fáil once again sees itself on the side of developers, extending the help-to-buy scheme which has further increased the cost of a home. In July, only weeks into the term of this new Government, it could not help itself. In the July stimulus package, the Government increased the tax rebate, which saw house prices soar overnight, not helping the first-time buyer but once again helping the developer. Is it a case of back to the future? Not really. It is just business as usual. Fianna Fáil never broke from the developer model of housing. Some things simply never change. We know what needs to be done and we in Sinn Féin are prepared to do it. As my colleague, Deputy Eoin Ó Broin, said, we need a Government that makes fewer gaffes and builds more gaffs. We have been saying this for a decade. It begs the question of why Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael cannot follow through on this. The answer is that they are stuck with the same special interests that want to the keep the current regime in place. Those vested interests are the bankers and the developers. We need homes and we need them now. A Sinn Féin Government would deliver the largest public housing programme in the history of the State. In 2021 we would deliver 20,000 social and affordable homes. That is what is needed. We would deliver 4,000 affordable purchase homes which would be sold for €230,000 or less, finally giving young families a chance to grow their family in their own home. We would bring in 4,000 affordable cost rentals which is absolutely necessary, meaning that those whose incomes just about pay their rent finally have some disposable income to enjoy life again and put some vital funds back into local businesses and the local economy. The Government has failed to meet its targets. We have not seen a single affordable unit to rent or buy delivered via any central government scheme this year, despite 6,000 being promised. The Minister has failed to even deliver his promised plan on affordable housing. Affordable units are being promised here in 2021, but that simply does not cut it. This represents 6,000 less homes in 2021 than what we provided in our submission. We would deliver 12,000 social homes. The scandal of housing waiting lists needs to be tackled urgently for those who have been waiting too long for a place to call home. Some 9,500 social homes are promised here today, yet the Government failed to deliver on 91% of this year's targets. This announcement represents a pitiful 593 extra real social homes above the existing commitments for 2021. This is a kick in the teeth to the tens of thousands of people languishing on social housing lists. There is no additional serviced sites funding for councils to deliver homes on public land. It falls short of what is needed and once again shows how out of touch this Government is. This budget does very little for renters. Rents are rising yet again. We would introduce a refundable tax credit, putting one month's rent back into renters' pockets, up to a sum of €1,500. We would re-introduce the Covid-19 emergency ban on evictions, notices to quit and rent increases. It is shocking but not surprising that the first act of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage as Minister was to strip renters of these vital protections introduced during the onset of the pandemic. Historically, Ireland suffered greatly from the problem of absentee landlords. Today we see that same problem manifest itself. These absentee landlords are non-resident investment funds or vulture funds as they are widely known. We will introduce a 3% stamp duty surcharge on these vulture funds. We will no longer be the state of the céad míle fáilte for vulture funds while driving tenants out of their homes with sky-high rents. It is unacceptable that these vulture funds are among the biggest landlords in this State and it is an outrage that it has gone so far that the UN has had to step in and condemn Government practices and attitudes to vulture funds. Unfortunately for many, their home really is not their sanctuary. This pandemic has brought with it many concerns for us as a community. The stay at home measures brought a very frightening reality for those living with their abuser, a feeling of no escape. If that is you and if you are in that situation please know that there are supports out there, people who will listen, people who believe you. We believe you. We need to ensure adequate supports for domestic abuse services. We would provide additional funding of €4.5 million for such emergency and step-down accommodation and supports. There is much talk about health. This pandemic has exposed and exacerbated the cracks in our health system. It has exposed the decades long failure to invest adequately in and fund our health service and the failure to ensure there are enough doctors, nurses and beds. There has been chronic underfunding in the building of capacity where it is needed. We need to spend the money where it is needed and we need to spend it on hiring front-line workers, on hospital beds and we also absolutely need to spend it on ICU beds. The Cabinet has four people who have served as Minister for Health, including the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. With that wealth of experience, it is surprising that our health system is still in the sorry state that it is, despite  This budget is nothing more than a repackaging of the winter plan. It does not go beyond or above it. It is a missed opportunity and, to say the least, very underwhelming. It will not do enough to deal with the major long-term capacity problems, nor will it move us from a system based on means to one centred on needs. What we needed to hear today was a plan to deliver more beds, not an excuse. There was a failure in the last years to increase permanent capacity in the health service. Beds were only ever temporarily funded. It is welcome to hear that they will become a baseline, but during these times, it is not good enough. That was last year's promise. We need a fresh start in health, which means a new vision to deliver additional beds and additional ICU beds to expand capacity in the health system. This budget is a short-term solution to keep matters steady, not to deliver more. Sinn Féin’s alternative budget would have delivered 100 ICU beds, 60 more than the Government, and begun capital works on 600 more new acute beds next year than the Government. Fine Gael led us into this pandemic with a health system bursting at its seams, with nurses regularly struggling for better conditions whilst working in highly strained, overcrowded hospitals. In my local hospital, Galway University Hospital, emergency full capacity protocol was invoked 135 times in the first five months of last year.A safe hospital runs at 85% capacity but every winter, acute hospitals operate at and over 100% capacity. None of this should be news to the Government. Over the past two decades there have been three bed capacity reviews, as well as multiple reports on critical and other care. The common conclusion of these various reports was that our system was badly lacking in acute and critical beds. What is frightening is that if we compare our system to the EU average, we are only at 50% of the number of intensive care unit, ICU, beds  This was the dangerous reality of healthcare under Fine Gael and it left us on the back foot when this pandemic knocked on our door. Now our health service is under pressure on several fronts. The healthcare system we deserve, a version of which is enjoyed across Europe, gives workers better terms and patients better treatment while delivering hospitals that are fit for purpose. We must be ambitious and make improvements every year to deliver so we can put people's health first. We need Sinn Féin's vision for healthcare. We want to deliver 100 additional ICU beds next year and 50 for each of the next four years. That is what is needed and what we propose. In 2009, the Towards Excellence in Critical Care report identified the need for 580 ICU beds this year. In 2009, we had 289 ICU beds but in 2020, far from 580, we have 280. That is on Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. They are promising us that we will have 321 ICU beds by the end of 2021 but this is not enough and the promise is not even likely to be fulfilled. We needed 580 ICU beds by the end of this year and 321 of those beds simply does not cut it. We need more acute beds next year to protect surge capacity and remove reliance on trolleys. We would hire 2,500 additional staff to fill vacancies, relieve the burden on existing staff and achieve safe staffing levels of nurses, consultants and other doctors. We would resolve the issue of pay inequality, which continues to hamper recruitment of specialists. We would fully fund the national cancer strategy and the national cancer control programme and have €10 million in additional funding for the catch-up of delayed screening and diagnosis. We would also provide an additional €12 million to deliver on the national cervical screening laboratory. Our vision for universal healthcare is in line with other European states. It sees healthcare as a human right and not a privilege. It is something to be delivered on the basis on needs rather than means. My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, mentioned people with disabilities and their carers and how they suffered disproportionately this year. They feel like they have been absolutely forgotten in this crisis. They have stood outside this building, telling their very personal stories of the impact this pandemic has had on their daily lives. We have heard of how their lives have been turned upside down, how the fantastic developments they have achieved thanks to their hard work in day services have regressed over the course of this year. Heartbroken families have been telling of the distress their loved ones faced at not being able to go into their beloved day services. These are not just services for these families - these are their lifelines. We have listened to their hardships but listening is not enough and action is needed. The Government’s plans of €100 million for this sector, while welcome as a step in the right direction, still falls short of what is needed. Citizens with a disability should never again feel they have been forgotten by anybody and they especially should never feel they have been forgotten by a Government. I have not heard much talk about the childcare sector. I am astounded by this but it is no wonder, I suppose, as it seems like nothing has been done. We know childcare costs are like a second mortgage, regularly meaning that parents must make a decision about can go to work. More often than not, this affects women disproportionately. A new model for childcare is needed. Childcare providers struggle to keep their doors open and there are approximately 4,500 of these providers in this State. For many, their business has become unsustainable, and without any real support from the Government, these small and medium enterprises, which not only provide childcare in remote and rural areas but also provide jobs in places where there is little alternative employment, cannot keep their doors open. All 27,000 childcare workers are some of the most highly skilled and qualified professionals but they are paid a pittance. It is clear that the current model of childcare provision in this State is failing everybody. The measures outlined in this budget have failed them yet again and it will do nothing to turn this matter around. There are no measures for fee reduction, no fund to help providers keep their doors open and no recognition for workers in the form of increases for them. Sinn Féin, unlike this Government and those preceding it, has a plan for the childcare sector that delivers for parents and workers. Over the course of two budgets, we would cut the costs for parents by two thirds. We would do this by having the State take on the wages of the sector and implementing and ensuring sustainability. We would immediately increase the pay of childcare workers to the living wage of €12.30 per hour. We would introduce a sustainability fund of €124 million for childcare providers to ensure the sector remains viable into the future. For those who say that this is not possible, we cannot afford it and it is all just wishful thinking, we should remember that when Ireland first planned to launch free secondary school education in the 1960s, we heard these exact same arguments. I imagine I would find it hard to get anyone in this Chamber who would now argue to abolish that. The reality is that the naysayers lost out and the State and our people have been all the better for it. Early childhood education plays a crucial part in children's development. This plan and vision for the sector is needed for the parents struggling to pay the childcare fees, the providers trying to keep the doors open, the underpaid workers and, most important, the children. We have heard about the VAT reduction for the tourism and hospitality sector from 13.5% to 9%, which I absolutely welcome because it is needed. However, 9% of nothing is still nothing. What the sector needs is cash being spent in the businesses now. We would introduce a tourism and hospitality voucher to every adult and child worth €200 and €100, respectively, and this would inject much-needed cash into the sector. It is said imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; this Government has tried to imitate this scheme but somehow made it more regressive. I note it has not been mentioned today. Many young people working in this sector have been hit really hard and youth unemployment stands at 37.8% when we include those on the pandemic unemployment payment. We must not force another generation of young people to emigrate in search of job opportunities. It is up to the Ministers to create the stimulus needed on a regionally balanced basis to allow our young people to stay at home. I did my leaving certificate in 2008 as one global crisis was unfolding and here we are in 2020 and leaving certificate students are again facing a crisis not of their making but one for which they will suffer the consequences. Many of my friends who emigrated during the last crisis still have not come home and I dearly hope that the same fate does not await the class of 2020. I can tell Members the untold devastation visited on parents and grandparents when they do not have their children visiting because they have been forced to emigrate. We have heard great things about our front-line workers and they deserve more than claps and platitudes. The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 is due to run out at the end of this year and claps do not put bread on the table or keep a roof over one's head. This Government has regularly said we are indebted to our public sector workers but it is time to put its money where its mouth is and reach a fair deal that not only recognises the pain public servants have suffered since 2008 but the heroics they have performed since the onset of Covid-19. We need a new collective pay agreement that brings about real pay equality in our public services, including pay parity for all section 39 workers and not just those who fell under the terms of the Workplace Relations Commission recommendation. This budget has done nothing on any of these fronts. We would bring about the immediate equalisation of pay grades for post-2011 public sector workers with their pre-2011 colleagues. We would bring about pay parity for section 39 workers, who are all too often forgotten by the Government. They are not forgotten by those people who rely on their services or the people with disabilities who they bring joy to on a daily basis and who need the routine of the same person helping them every day. There is the question of politicians' pay and the spirit that we are indeed ""all in it together"". We would reduce the salaries of Deputies and Senators, and as my colleague, Deputy Mark Ward, recently pointed out, it is mad that he, just a year into his job, has been offered three pay rises while most people's incomes have fallen off a cliff.This is why we need to reverse the cuts to the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment and introduce a wage support scheme that is fit for purpose and targeted and supports all workers. I was very interested to hear what was said about capital investment. We are in a crisis now and we need to act proportionately. There is nothing fiscally prudent about doing too little too late. Countercyclical spending is the means of getting out of this crisis. This budget should not be about keeping the economy at a standstill and keeping the lights on. It is essential that this budget stimulates the economy by pumping money back into businesses and people's pockets. The risk here is that we do too little rather than too much. This budget does not cut it in terms of capital expenditure. The capital expenditure the Minister outlined amounts to €10.1 billion. I have heard it stated that this is an addition of €1.6 billion. I do not know what school of mathematical thought that is. Where I went to school, €9.1 billion minus €10.1 billion equals €1 billion. This will not provide enough firepower to counteract the downturn. I stressed this to the Minister time and again. It has fallen far short of not only what we have called for but it has fallen far short of what the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IBEC and Fianna Fáil and the Green Party's old pals in the International Monetary Fund, IMF, called for. A Sinn Féin Government would roll out a €2.5 billion enhanced capital investment programme across a range of areas, including housing, hospitals and schools. This would create more than 26,500 jobs while meeting the needs for affordable accommodation and healthcare services. This is the kind of stimulus that we need. At least 150,000 jobs have been lost during the course of this pandemic, so the question is not merely how we maintain existing employment through the various business and income supports. It is how we begin to replace and expand employment that has already been lost through large-scale capital investment in shovel-ready projects. I am deeply concerned that the recovery fund appears to be a ""maybe fund"". I am stunned that the Government feels that the economic crisis is not bad enough for it to allocate this fund immediately. What is it waiting for? Jobs are being lost, businesses are being closed and people are in significant rent and mortgage arrears. Now is simply not the time to wait and see. Another issue of concern is that the budget the Minister has laid before this House is not only anti-rural Ireland but by increasing the cost of operating a car for the average person while cancelling bus routes, it represents an attack on rural Ireland. These policies are neither green nor rural. This Government seems committed to casting rural Ireland adrift. It had the opportunity to rebalance the scales from the beef barons to the ordinary farmers. This is what was committed to in the programme for Government. This Government committed to ""[p]rotect and enhance the incomes and livelihoods of family farms"". It was meant to be a ""key objective"" of this Government. The suckler farmer was left behind in the July stimulus and this budget represents nothing other than outright abandonment. In our budget proposal Sinn Féin committed to protecting the Irish family farm as a way of life. We proposed a new suckler scheme that would front-load payments at €300 per cow with lower payments after the first 15, committed funds to the national reserve fund to help give young farmers a start and committed to areas of natural constraint to support the less intensive farming this Government claims to support. These policies represent a bold vision that would have provided rural Ireland with a bulwark with which to face the uncertainty of Brexit and the ongoing Covid-19 situation. The people of rural Ireland will not be served by this budget. Not only are we facing the crisis of Covid-19, we are facing the crisis of a no-deal Brexit. There is no Brexit which could be good for Ireland. With its highly provocative United Kingdom Internal Market Bill 2019-21, the British Government has already threatened to tear up an international agreement and commitment that it entered into. Britain's lax attitude to international law should be of no surprise to us here in Ireland. Its actions threaten the livelihoods of those in Border communities and the agricultural sector, which will have knock-on effects for the wider community. We believe that should Britain exit the EU without a deal, at least €1 billion will be needed in order to support the sectors and regions most directly impacted. We need clarity from the Minister on how much of the recovery fund will be allocated to the Brexit contingency fund. It has been said that one should never let a good crisis go to waste. Let us not miss this opportunity to reimagine what this country could be and the role of the State in remaking it. Should the role of the State be relegated to merely correcting market failures, as those of the cosy neoliberal consensus think, or should it have grander ambitions? Should it seek to harness the power and resources at its disposal to tackle the burning issues of our day? Should the State take a more active role in addressing income and wealth inequality? Should it take a more active role in providing access to housing and healthcare, basing its actions on need rather than means? Should it seek to create, shape and drive markets rather than just fixing them? To all of those questions, we answer ""Yes"". To those who might have looked on as the Government announced its budgetary measures and wondered how will any of this help them, I sympathise. This budget is bereft of ideas, bereft of ambition and, more than that, bereft of an overarching vision. It is characteristic of a Government that has been beset by chaos and whose main priority is damage limitation. The parties of the Civil War, which have taken turns governing this State for so long, now find themselves in a position where they must enter into a coalition. Even working in tandem, these two old beasts of Irish politics have shown they do not have the vision, the ambition or the drive to rebuild the new Ireland we so badly need. Today, almost a century since this island was partitioned and the Free State was born, a new chapter in Irish political history is ready to be written. The bad news is that today's budget does nothing for ordinary workers and families, but the good news is that people should not lose hope. We in Sinn Féin have the policies, the politics and the people to rebuild Ireland, united, fairer and better."	spk_7
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-10-08	dail	33	Official Languages (Amendment) Bill 2019: Second Stage	dbsect_28	Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire agus leis an Aire Stáit as ucht a bpoist nua. Is maith an rud é go bhfuil muid anseo inniu chun Bille nua ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla a phlé. Tá 17 bliana caite ó tugadh an tAcht féin isteach agus gealladh an Bille leasaithe seo sé bliana ó shin, nach mór. Ar a laghad, tá sé de sheans againn anois an Bille a scrúdú mar is cuí. Ba léir nach raibh an Bille teanga a cuireadh os comhair Teachtaí i ndeireadh na bliana seo caite feiliúnach. Ar chuid de na laigí a tugadh aird orthu ag an am, bhí easpa spriocdháta don chuspóir go mbeadh líofacht sa Ghaeilge ag 20% d'oibrithe nua sa tseirbhís phoiblí; ní raibh spriocdháta ar bith maidir le seirbhísí poiblí i nGaeilge a chinntiú do mhuintir na Gaeltachta; ní raibh ionadaíocht ar bith ag saineolaithe ná ag pobal na Gaeilge ar an gcoiste comhairleach a bhí molta; agus gan dréachtchaighdeáin a bheith ar fáil mar eiseamláir do chóras na gcaighdeán teanga a thiocfadh isteach in áit na scéimeanna teanga. Níl aon amhras ach gur chúis áthais a bhí ann domsa nuair a gealladh i gclár an Rialtais seo go ndéanfaí láidriú ar a raibh molta sa Bhille deireanach. Ar an ábhar sin, cuirim fáilte chroíúil roimh an leasú chun cumhachtaí breise a thabhairt don Choimisinéir Teanga sa chaoi is gur féidir leis faireachán a dhéanamh ar aon Acht a bhfuil baint aige le húsáid na Gaeilge nó lena stádas mar theanga oifigiúil. Tá sé ríthábhachtach go mbeadh sé de chead ag an gcoimisinéir tráchtaireacht a dhéanamh ar dlíthe eile, seachas Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla amháin. Easpa mhór sa Bhille a bhí ann ná nach raibh cead ag an gcoimisinéir ach iniúchadh a dhéanamh ar sheachaint dualgais nuair a ndéantar gearán agus táim an-sásta go bhfuil sé sin curtha ina cheart ag an Rialtas. Ina theannta sin, is céim eile chun cinn é go gcuirfidh na leasuithe spriocdháta den 31 Nollaig 2030 leis an gcuspóir sa Bhille go mbeadh 20% d'oibrithe nua sa tseirbhís phoiblí ina gcainteoirí Gaeilge. Is cur chuige tomhaiste ciallmhar é seo ach tá fadhbanna ann, mar a luaigh mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Ó Snodaigh. Ní thuigim beag ná mór tuige a bhfuiltear ag moladh go mbeadh sé de chumhacht ag an Aire ordú a dhéanamh in 2028 go gcuirfí siar an spriocdháta sin. Mugadh magadh atá ann spriocdháta a leagan amach agus ag an am céanna a rá gur féidir é a shíneadh amach mura n-éireoidh leis. Ní luíonn sé le réasún agus creidim go láidir gur cheart an leasú sin a bhaint ón mBille. Ba chóir freisin go mbeadh sé ina dhualgas reachtúil ag duine nó dream ar leith maidir leis an bplean náisiúnta earcaíochta a chur i bhfeidhm. Údar mór díomá eile atá sa Bhille seo ná nach bhfuil foráil láidir ann a leagfadh dualgas reachtúil ar chomhlachtaí poiblí freastal ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta ina dteanga dhúchais. Is minic atá sé ráite ach is tobar luachmhar teangeolaíoch iad na ceantair Ghaeltachta is láidre sa tír agus tá brú aisteach ar na pobail seo ar go leor bealaí. Níl na jabanna le fáil agus níl an infreastruchtúr gréasáin sásúil ar chor ar bith idir leathanbhanda, bóithre agus cuanta. Cuireann sé seo ar fad iallach ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta an baile a fhágáil ar thóir oibre agus is iondúil gur i mBéarla a bhíonn an obair sin ar fáil. Ar a dhroim sin, nuair a bhíonn muintir na Gaeltachta ag plé le seirbhísí an Stáit, bíonn orthu iompú ar an mBéarla go rímhinic chun a gcuid gnó a dhéanamh. Is í an teachtaireacht atá ann don chainteoir dúchais Ghaeilge, mar sin, go bhfuil sé go breá acu labhairt go príobháideach lena muintir nó le cairde i nGaeilge ach sa saol poiblí is é Béarla an teanga atá ann agus a bhéas in uachtar. Mar atá ráite ag an sochtheangeolaí aitheanta, an Dr John Walsh, ní bheidh mórán údaráis i ndáiríre ag reachtaíocht teanga nach dtugann aghaidh ar na háiteanna ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge fós á labhairt mar theanga an phobail. Ba cheart go mbeadh an Stát ina eiseamláir maidir le soláthair seirbhísí Gaeilge ach ina ionad sin tá Bille os ár gcomhair nach ndéanann caint ar bith faoin éileamh bunúsach seo a chur ar fáil i nGaeilge agus gan cheist an chuirfeadh an Stát a chuid seirbhísí ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht ná tada ach an oiread faoin gceart níos bunúsaí fós a bheith ag duine ainm agus seoladh i nGaeilge a úsáid i gcúrsaí oifigiúla. Tagraím don Choiste Comhairleach agus ba cheart go mbeadh ionchur ag sciar níos leithne de phobal na Gaeilge air sin, go háirithe saineolaithe teanga agus daoine ón bpobal a thuigeann go rímhaith cén tionchar a bhéas ag an reachtaíocht ar an bpobal. Tá sé ráite ag Conradh na Gaeilge gur cheart tuilleadh cumhachtaí a thabhairt don Choimisinéir Teanga chun go mbeadh cead aige Billí nua agus polasaithe Rialtais a scrúdú, faoi mar a dhéantar sa Bhreatain Bheag. Tagaim 100% leis an moladh seo. Is deis atá sa Bhille seo céimeanna móra chun cinn a ghlacadh maidir le seirbhísí Gaeilge a chur ar fáil don phobal agus chun cur le cumas an Stáit freastal mar is cóir ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Cé go gcuirim fáilte roimh chuid de na leasuithe atá molta ag an Rialtas, is léir gur Bille easnamhach atá ann go fóill agus go bhfuil easpa físe ag baint leis. Is é an cheist a bheadh agamsa don Rialtas ná cén toradh atá sé ag iarraidh ón mBille seo? Is éard a bheadh mise ag iarraidh uaidh ná go ndéanfaí éascaíocht do mhuintir na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta saol trí Ghaeilge a bheith acu sa tír seo. Más é sin a theastaíonn ón Aire, ón Aire Stáit agus ón Rialtas, chaithfí go dtuigeann siad gur chúis imní í an treocht reatha i leith úsáid na Gaeilge sna pobail Ghaeltachta ina bhfuil sí fós beo mar theanga phobail. Ní bheifear in ann an méid seo a iompú ar ais de cheal polasaithe láidir a dhéanfaidh an Ghaeilge a shní isteach i chuile chuid den saol. Sin é an dúshlán atá romhainn agus is ar an mbonn sin a impím ar an Aire agus ar an Aire Stáit breathnú an athuair ar an reachtaíocht seo, na leasuithe cuí a choinneáil agus a láidriú agus ansin na leasuithe gan chiall atá luaite agam a fhágáil amach ar fad sula dtabharfaí an Bille isteach.	spk_195
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-09-29	dail	33	Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_14	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle, leis an Aire agus leis an Aire Stáit. Ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a ghabháil leo chomh maith as a bpoist nua. Mar atá pléite anseo, tá a fhios againn go bhfuil an earnáil foraoise i gcruachás le tamall anuas. Lig an Rialtas a bhí ann i ndearmad í agus tá sé thar am é seo a phlé sa Seomra seo. Cuirim fáilte roimhe seo agus roimh an dea-obair freisin a rinne na hAirí féin le mo chomhghleacaithe. Bhí tionchar tromchúiseach, ar ndóigh, ag na riaráistí achomhairc ar an tionscal seo le tamall. Tá na mílte duine ag brath ar an tionscal seo chun bia a chur ar an mbord. Léiríonn sé an neamhshuim a bhí ag an Rialtas i gceantair iargúlta, ceantair atá buailte go trom freisin i dtéarmaí eacnamaíochta mar gheall ar Covid-19. Cuirim fáilte roimh bhunú rannáin chun dul i ngleic leis an gceist seo ach caithfimid a chinntiú go mbunófar é chomh luath agus is féidir agus go mbeidh na hacmhainní cuí aige. Chomh maith leis sin caithfear a chinntiú go mbeidh saineolas acu siúd a cheapfar ar an rannán seo mar go mbeidh siad ag teacht ar chinntí atá fíorthábhachtach don earnáil seo. Tá súil agam go dtabharfaidh an Rialtas tacaíocht do leasú Shinn Féin ina thaobh sin. The reality, as we have discussed here, is that the forestry sector is in crisis right now. It is welcome that this situation is being discussed in the Chamber as it affects the lives and livelihoods of people across the State, especially in our rural areas, as my colleague, Deputy Martin Kenny, has outlined. The backlog of appeals has had a major impact on the industry and, as a result, the industry has faced a crisis. We know that this is not resolved, by January at the latest Ireland will need to import timber. In all likelihood, that will happen even earlier. The issue was ignored by the previous Government, even though it has been on the cards since December of last year when it was highlighted in the  The establishment of the divisions is welcome but we need to ensure there is no delay in setting them up, and we must ensure the divisions are adequately resourced. A key concern Sinn Féin has with the Bill is that there is no explicit requirement for those appointed to the divisions by the Minister to have relevant expertise. I hope the Government sees sense on this issue and will support the Sinn Féin amendment to ensure members have expertise in biodiversity, water quality, climate change and environmental legislation. As I said earlier, it is essential that we deal with this matter here today. It is vitally important that Sinn Féin amendments to this Bill are taken into consideration and supported by the Government to ensure the best possible outcome for the sector and, of course, the communities and the people affected by the Bill.	spk_197

As such, I fail to see any additionality in what is indicated in the July stimulus.

Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-09-24	dail	33	EU-UK Negotiations on Brexit: Statements	dbsect_21	"Today we saw the leaders of the pro-Remain parties in the North travel to Dublin to raise their concerns about the impact of the UK Internal Market Bill on the North. The Bill flies in the face of strands one, two and three of the Good Friday Agreement. It allows the British Government to remove powers that were devolved to the Executive in the North, which is in complete disregard to strand one of the agreement. We now see the Assembly has voted to oppose this UK Internal Market Bill. The word ""precedents"" was used by Mr. Brandon Lewis, MP, when he advised Westminster that the British Government would be breaking an international agreement. He said there were precedents for the British Government needing to consider its international obligations. This should not be a shock to any of us and I am surprised by some of the contributions I listened to earlier. This should come as no surprise to us in Ireland as we are fully aware of Britain's attitude to international obligations. One stark example personal to me was when, in 1995, the European Court of Human Rights found that the British Government had violated Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to life, when it murdered three people in Gibraltar. We cannot allow any British Government to ever again disregard international laws or obligations in this way. There is a solution provided in the Good Friday Agreement and we are obliged to consider it now. It is the holding of a referendum on Irish unity. I have heard some politicians saying today that such a suggestion is provocative but at a time when British politicians have admitted in their Parliament that they are willing to break an international agreement by publishing this Bill, with the people of the North simply collateral damage to the plan, the mind boggles that the suggestion of a referendum could be provocative. I appeal especially to Deputies from the Government parties who consider themselves advocates for a united Ireland not to be part of another Government in a long history of Governments that stands idly by while the liberties of the people of the North are trampled. It is absolutely now time for Irish unity."	spk_188

Ar ndóigh, beidh tionscnaimh chaipitiúla lárnach sa phlé sin. Sílim gurb é seo seans don Rialtas cuí a chur ar bhóithre Chonamara. Níl bóthar maith amháin istigh i gConamara faoi láthair. Tá roinnt oibre á déanamh ar an N59 as Gaillimh go dtí an Clochán ach tá deacrachtaí leis an gcuid eile dóibh. Ba cheart na deacrachtaí sin a réiteach go práinneach. Rinne Comhairle Contae na Gaillimhe iarracht bóthar nua a dhéanamh as Gaillimh go Scríb ach arís tháinig deacrachtaí timpeallachta sa bhealach orthu. Dá mbeadh an bóthar nua sin ann, bheadh lánaí rothar ann chomh maith le seans páirceáil agus taisteal. Tá sé ráite ag innealtóirí sinsearacha nach féidir caoi cheart a chur ar bhóthar atá siar le farraige as Gaillimh trí Chonamara toisc go bhfuil an iomarca bóithríní beaga ag síneadh uaidh. Níl sé ceart ná cóir go mbeadh muintir Chonamara fágtha ar an gcaoi seo. Scríobh mé litir chuig an Aire an tseachtain seo caite faoi Bhóthar Chuan na Loinge atá ag cur bac ar dhaoine dul ag an obair ná ar scoil mar gheall go bhfuil sé faoi uisce chomh minic sin. Tá fadhb amháin eile ann. Níl córas iompair phoiblí sásúil i gConamara ach an oiread. Tá an costas céanna de €13 ar bhus ón gCeathrú Rua go Ghaillimh is atá ar bhus ó Gaillimh go Baile Átha Cliath. Níl sé sásúil. I want to raise the issue of the dangerous condition of roads in Connemara. As we approach budget 2021, we will need to look at job creation and capital investment projects. I urge the Minister to consider the really dangerous conditions of the roads in Connemara and to intervene urgently to address this situation. The road from Barna to Screebe, which includes cycle lanes, is a prime example of this. I wrote to the Minister last week about the condition of the road at Cuan na Luinge, which has been sinking and is now impassable for residents in the area. The unfortunate reality is that the people of Connemara have few alternatives because there is no adequate bus service. The bus from Carraroe to Galway city costs €13, which is the same as one would pay to go from Galway city to Dublin by bus. I ask the Minister to intervene in this matter without delay.	spk_236
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-09-23	dail	33	Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Bill 2020: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_19	This is an interesting week to be discussing this particular Bill and these considerations. At the start of the week we had the latest revelations of shady practices within the global financial system involving many top global institutions. The so-called FinCEN Files of approximately 2,500 leaked documents involving about $2 trillion of transactions have revealed how some of the world's biggest banks have allowed criminals to move dirty money around the world. They also showed how Russian oligarchs have used banks to avoid sanctions that were supposed to stop them bringing money into the West. It is the latest in a string of leaks over the past five years that have exposed secret deals, money laundering and financial crime. We have had the Lux Leaks, the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers in addition to a whole host of other leaks, all of which have revealed massive tax avoidance and evasion, money laundering as well as other criminal activities. On Sunday,  According to new research from Trinity College professors James Stewart and Cillian Doyle, between 2005 and 2017 there were 106 Irish-registered shell companies connected to some of Russia's largest state-owned and private companies which raised gross funds of approximately €118 billion, making Ireland one of the main jurisdictions for the raising of these funds. In terms of net debt flows, Ireland was the second highest EU jurisdiction, just behind Luxembourg. These types of shell companies have raised enormous sums of money for different companies which have been alleged to have engaged in serious wrongdoing. Some of them have been subject to economic sanction. Some have been identified as having engaged in insider trading and market manipulation, while several recently collapsed Russian banks were accused of creating fictitious loans, defrauding customers and then requiring bailouts. What is common to all these Irish shell companies is that they all availed of the section 110 tax concession, meaning their effective rate of tax was zero or near zero, and they generally use complex, anonymous trustee ownership structures. The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) (Amendment) Bill looks to bring greater transparency. Specifically, we need greater transparency around beneficial ownership of company assets. In other words, it helps us demonstrate who owns what. The problem, however, is that it allows trustees to be listed as beneficial owners even when they are often acting as an intermediary for the ultimate beneficial owner and therefore they provide a layer of secrecy that criminals can seek to exploit. That is my biggest concern about it.	spk_289

Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-09-16	dail	33	Workers' Rights: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_18	Ag 6.30 a.m., i mo chathair féin, cathair na Gaillimhe, sheas iaroibrithe Debenhams taobh amuigh den fhoirgneamh ina mbíodh siad ag obair agus iad ag éileamh a gcuid cearta bunúsacha. Tá siad tar éis seasamh taobh amuigh de na siopaí seo ar feadh os cionn 160 lá anois agus tá sé thar am dúinn seasamh leo. At 6.30 a.m., workers of Debenhams in my home city of Galway started their picket outside their former employer. They have waited, protested, engaged for 161 days for a just exit package. They continue to stand outside the Debenhams stores as we debate this, to demand basic respect from an employer they gave so many years to. They feel abandoned and they have absolutely been abandoned. They have been abandoned by an employer they gave years of service to and they have been abandoned by this Government. Before the Government says how was it to know, I say that we all knew. We saw what happened to the Clerys workers, and we have the recommendations from the Duffy Cahill report, which was released four years ago. This report needs to be implemented now. The time for hemming and hawing is long over. These workers are in a crisis right at this moment and we need to do this to protect them as well as many other workers who may face this same situation. It has happened before, it is happening now and we sure as hell cannot let it happen again. We need legislation to protect workers and we need it urgently. This is not an Opposition idea. This idea is coming directly from the workers. They are not picketing for the sake of picketing. They have been forced to stand out on the picket line to fight for justice, a justice that we must ensure is delivered. This is only one of the many failings we continue to have in this State in relation to workers' rights. It is high time that we had protections in place for workers. One hundred and forty jobs were lost in Galway. Some of these people had given more than 30 years' service. Collectively, the Galway workers have given more than 300 years of service to the company. Tá dualgas orainn seasamh leis na hoibrithe seo, tacú leo agus cinntiú nach féidir leis seo tarlú arís.	spk_307
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-09-16	dail	33	Expenditure Response to Covid-19 Crisis: Statements	dbsect_21	"I am sharing time with Deputies Pearse Doherty and Brian Stanley. Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire agus an Aire Stáit as an méid a dúirt siad. Ní fhéadfaí beag is fiú a dhéanamh de thionchar an choróinvíris ar ár ngeilleagar, ár bpobal agus, ar ndóigh, ar shaol na cosmhuintire. Cailleadh daoine le linn na paindéime seo, chaill teaghlaigh a n-ioncaim ar fad agus níl a fhios ag go leor daoine céard atá i ndán dóibh. Teastaíonn infheistíocht inár ndaoine, inár ngnóthaí agus inár bpobal. Cinntíonn infheistíocht níos airde go gearrthéarmach costas níos ísle eacnamaíochta agus sóisialta go fadtéarmach. It is hard to overstate the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on our economy, our communities and people's lives. We have heard this pandemic and our battle with this virus being likened to a wartime situation and I think that language is fitting. Families have lost loved ones, whole households have lost their incomes, and many people have no idea what the future holds. These unprecedented times have required us to take the kinds of drastic measures that would be unheard of outside of a wartime situation. The various income support measures that were introduced have been essential in keeping the economy going, keeping people in jobs and preventing the mass immiseration of people. However, many feel they have been completely forgotten during this pandemic, such as the people who have gathered outside this building on Kildare Street and on Merrion Square; the taxi drivers who protested outside yesterday; the Debenhams workers, about whom we had a robust debate earlier; carers and many others. We are in extraordinary times and it is worth noting that when the Revised Estimates were debated in May and additional expenditure was sought, we knew that much of it had already been spent. That is reflective of the extreme fluidity and uncertainty of the situation in which we are living.Voted spending is now well above pre-pandemic forecasts, with social protection and health naturally accounting for the lion's share. While on the face of it this might seem shocking in magnitude, it is matched in scale only by the level of the crisis. Higher expenditure in the short term is necessary to avoid long-term social and economic devastation. I recognise the Government having taken on board much of the constructive criticism that has been made by me and colleagues and the various anomalies we have highlighted, especially in income and business supports. Several of the shortcomings we highlighted were addressed, such as our work to increase the subsidy for low-paid workers under the temporary wage subsidy scheme and to include SMEs that were initially excluded from grants. There are, however, ongoing issues with the lack of an appeals process for the PUP and the eligibility for certain groups, including artists, musicians and others in the entertainment industry. We have heard how difficult they have had it in contributions this evening and through the various representations made by that sector to all of us in recent days. There is also the fact that under the new EWSS, employees with gross weekly income of less than €152 per week will not be eligible for any subsidy. It is still my hope that these issues, in addition to the many others we raised, will be recognised in the forthcoming budget. We know that on the path ahead the fiscal rules have been abandoned and no timeline for their reintroduction has been proposed. Restrictive rules for government spending at a time of unprecedented crisis are a recipe for disaster, as the period of harsh fiscal austerity clearly demonstrated. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, an institution known for its cautious conservatism, has forecast that our deficit will fall dramatically over the next five years, and that is without the need for austerity measures. The programme for Government states that budget 2021 will set out a medium-term roadmap detailing how Ireland will reduce the deficit and return to a broadly balanced budget, but this phrasing concerns me slightly. Surely the Government has learned the lessons of the previous crisis. Past Governments have tended to have a poor record on counter-cyclical spending and have often reflected that old Charlie McCreevy mantra of ""When we have it, we spend it, and when we do not have it, we do not spend it."" Deficit reduction should not be the guide for our economic policy over the medium term. What matters now is not the size of our deficit but the sustainability of our debt. We know from the financial crisis that the victims of premature deficit reduction are always infrastructure and public services, and times such as this pandemic show how vital these services are and how much more vulnerable a lack of investment made us when battling Covid-19. I acknowledge that the Minister stated building a healthcare system that can cope with Covid-19 is no easy task but that it is one we must meet, and I hope that will remain crucial to any further spending decisions. It would be a more progressive and pragmatic strategy for the Government to adopt the golden rule approach to budgetary spending, whereby the Government borrows to fund capital investment projects that will benefit future generations by enhancing accessibility and facilitating trade, improving mobility, generating greater employment opportunities and boosting overall economic productivity. We need to remember that investment is not a cost but something that can increase our productive capacity and boost future growth. This was done in the late 1980s and helped to reduce our debt-to-GDP ratio by almost 50%. The major difference is that today we can borrow to fund this capital investment at historically low rates and it would be negligent not to do so. Last week, the National Treasury Management Agency, our debt management agency, sold €1 billion worth of bonds at a negative rate of 0.098%. This essentially means investors are paying the State to borrow their money. It offers a significant opportunity for major capital investment projects that can put people back to work in good jobs with good pay and addresses serious deficiencies in housing and health that have spanned numerous Governments, helping to bring about more inclusive growth that will shrink our debt as a proportion of economic growth. The Minister stated last week that this should be an investment-led recovery and I agree. This certainly seems to be the approach taken by some member states. The French President, Emmanuel Macron, has just announced the France relaunch stimulus programme, which proposes €100 million in spending on jobs, businesses and large environmental capital projects. Earlier this summer the German Government announced plans for €40 billion in green projects as part of its €120 billion stimulus package. We need to replicate this in our own right. Some commentators in the Irish media have tried to downplay the severity and scale of the economic crisis. They have sought refuge in our headline GDP figures, which demonstrated the lowest year-on-year decline of all EU member states for the second quarter. We shed less than 3%, whereas Spain's GDP shrank by a whopping 22.5%. As my colleague, Deputy Doherty, noted last Tuesday, when examined from a jobs point of view, which should be the real measure of resilience, we exhibited the second highest number of job losses, narrowly losing out to Spain. How can we be the best performing economy in terms of GDP and yet second only to Spain, the country with the worst rate of job losses? I do not wish to go into the details because we all know the issues with using GDP as a measure of the health of the economy, but recent data from the Parliamentary Budgetary Office show that, to date, annual corporation tax receipts have outperformed forecasts, with August receipts being 31.5% higher than the same period last year. This is being driven mainly by the multinational sector, with the likes of big pharma and big tech taken into consideration, but we should not forget that SMEs account for more than 99% of active enterprises in the State and almost 70% of employment. This sector is struggling. As a recent Economic and Social Research Institute report showed, almost 50% of SMEs do not have enough cash reserves to cover one month's expenses, so it is little wonder that Ireland is currently the worse EU country for investment. A simple way of measuring investment within the economy is to look at gross fixed capital formation, which is a component of the expenditure method of calculating GDP and includes spending on the likes of plant machinery, equipment purchases, land improvements, and the construction of railways, roads, residential dwellings and industrial and commercial buildings. It takes account of how much is being built and the kinds of productive assets that help bring about even more production. According to European statistics, we are the worst in this class. Gross fixed capital formation has fallen off a cliff, which means we are currently the second worst in the EU in terms of job losses and the worst in terms of investing in production. This is where the State needs to step in, not merely with current spending but also with capital expenditure. Tá sé soiléir dúinn ar fad go bhfuil dúshlán mór romhainn. Baineann an dúshlán sin le cúrsaí sláinte, eacnamaíochta agus sóisialta. Tá go leor plé déanta againn ar na himpleachtaí atá ag an ngéarchéim seo ar mheabhairshláinte na ndaoine. Nuair atáimid ag déileáil leis an bhfadhb seo agus ag iarraidh athshlánú eacnamaíochta a dhéanamh, ba cheart dúinn a chinntiú go bhfuil na daoine agus na pobail i gcroílár chuile shórt atá á dhéanamh againn. Nuair atáimid ag cruthú post maith a íocann go maith, ba chóir dúinn a chinntiú go bhfuil siad sna ceantracha éagsúla agus ní hamháin sna cathracha. Sna blianta atá amach romhainn, agus muid ag breathnú siar ar an bpaindéim seo, tá súil agam go mbeidh Stát níos cothroime againn ná mar atá againn anois."	spk_375
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-09-03	dail	33	Back to School, Further and Higher Education and Special Education: Statements	dbsect_27	Bhí mic léinn ó Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh, i dteagmháil liom le roinnt seachtainí anuas faoin bhrú uafásach airgeadais atá orthu. Tá mé tar éis fadhb na dtáillí do na hathscrúduithe a ardú leis an Aire i litir cheana féin. Fuair siad réidh leis na táillí seo i go leor ollscoileanna, ach ní bhfuair siad réidh leo in Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh go dtí seo. Impím ar an Aire brú a chur ar an ollscoil sin fáil réidh leis na táillí seo. I have been contacted by a large number of students in recent weeks and months in regard to their precarious financial situation on the return to third level education. Young people have been hit very hard by this pandemic. Many have lost their jobs, others have been unable to take up summer work and, at the same time, many have been ineligible for the pandemic unemployment payment as a result of the nature of their jobs. As another blow, many find themselves just above the threshold and, therefore, outside the eligibility criteria for SUSI, and we have, of course, seen an extra 2,600 students apply for SUSI. Bhí cúpla duine ón nGaeltacht, a bhíonn ag obair i gcoláistí samhraidh na Gaeltachta de ghnáth, i dteagmháil liom. Chaill siad amach ar an obair seo mar gheall ar an bpaindéim. Bíonn siad ag brath ar an airgead a fhaigheann siad ón obair seo chun íoc as an ollscoil, ach níor cuireadh é sin san áireamh agus iad ag cur isteach i gcomhair SUSI. The reality is that even if people are in receipt of SUSI, it no longer covers rent. NUI Galway students union has highlighted that the cheapest room in the new student accommodation is at a cost of €8,800. Let us be realistic about this. That is out of reach of most 18-year-olds and highlights once again the huge financial pressures students find themselves under. I have contacted the Minister directly in regard to the repeat exam fee being levied on students in NUI Galway. Students are being asked to pay €295 for repeat exams in that institution despite these exams being held online and despite the fact most universities have waived this fee. I urge the Minister to intervene in this calamity and to ask that NUI Galway would follow the example of other universities in waiving this fee.  I understand that, because of the continuous underfunding of this sector by successive Governments, the third level sector has to rely on other income sources for funding. However, last year, according to figures I received, NUI Galway collected €340,539.97 in repeat fees. How did we ever get to the point where institutions are relying on students failing exams to fund our education system? Students are being told they will be spending approximately 30% of the semester on campus, yet there is absolutely no let-up in fees. One woman contacted me today to say that her fees have increased for the part-time course she is doing despite all lectures being online for the first semester. Students in NUI Galway are also being asked to pay a levy of €240 to register despite this being used towards clubs and societies. I do not see how this can be justified when, realistically, most of it will be online. This pandemic has highlighted once again the real inequality in our education system. The costs I have highlighted are massive barriers to people who want to enter third level education. I urge the Minister to intervene in this regard.	spk_181
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-07-29	dail	33	Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Bill 2020: Second Stage	dbsect_3	Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil mé buartha faoi thodhchaí go leor de na ceantair is iargúlta sa Stát seo. Bíonn na hoileáin amuigh ón gcósta ag brath ar thurasóireacht, agus níl tionscal ar bith eile i mbailte beaga ar an gcósta. Tá siad ag brath ina iomláine ar thurasóireacht. Teastaíonn cinnteacht uathu go mbeidh airgead ag teacht isteach chucu láithreach. Is mór an trua í go bhfuil éiginnteacht fós ann i measc gnólachtaí agus teaghlaigh, fiú amháin tar éis seoladh an July stimulus agus an reachtaíocht seo. I am concerned there is a lack of understanding of the economic reality of many families, as well as many communities. I think particularly of those businesses and the communities they sustain in areas heavily reliant on tourism. In concept, the stay and spend initiative is great but, unfortunately, the reality is way off the mark. It seems to be a copy of the Sinn Féin proposal for a voucher scheme gone wrong.The Government has said that about 2.8 million people will avail of the stay and spend initiative but once again people have been left out. Sinn Féin has pointed out that many people do not pay income tax because they do not have enough of an income to incur a tax liability. Some of the lowest paid workers in the State do not earn enough to pay income tax so they are excluded. The Government has said that the credit could then be set against the claimant's universal social charge liability but as the Department of Finance's own ready reckoner shows, an estimated 715,600 taxpayers do not pay either income tax or USC. There is a large cohort of people who are very uncertain about their financial future, including people who are currently out of work due to the Covid-19 pandemic and are in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment, people who are working but are concerned that the company they work for may no longer be viable and small business owners who are deeply worried that they will have to close their doors. We should be realistic: waiting a year or two to claim back their tax is not an option for these people. They do not have money in their back pockets now, and even if they did, they do not know when they might need it for an emergency as there is so little financial security. Not only would a voucher scheme have allowed an immediate cash injection into local businesses, which in turn would have boosted the economies of many of our most rural and isolated communities, it would also have given much-needed relief to families, workers and all those who have struggled in recent months. They would have been able to go for a day trip with their children, a meal in a restaurant or even a staycation. Sinn Féin also proposed a VAT reduction targeted to the tourism and hospitality sector from 13.5% to 9%. This sector, on which many of the most rural areas in the west and on the offshore islands are reliant, is on its knees. They are so reliant on this sector because successive Governments have failed to provide the infrastructure and investment necessary to build indigenous businesses or attract other industries. There is poor road, sewerage and water infrastructure as well as zero broadband in many communities. Under the terms of the revised restart grant, support will also be provided for enterprises that were unable to access the original grant scheme. I do not doubt that this support has come about as a result of many Members highlighting their concerns. It means that non-rateable bed and breakfast accommodation providers or sports businesses will be eligible for a grant payment of €4,000. Non-rated bed and breakfast accommodation providers will be eligible to apply through Fáilte Ireland, with local authorities being the avenue for these other businesses. However, there has been no clarity on when the application process will open. These businesses need to access these grants immediately but the websites of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Fáilte Ireland and many local authorities merely say that applications will open in due course. Will the Minister give a date, perhaps in writing, for when the application process will officially open? Teastaíonn cabhair uathu anois. Teastaíonn cabhair ó mhuintir na n-áiteanna seo chun na pobail seo a choinneáil ag imeacht ionas go mbeidh na pobail sna ceantair is iargúlta fós ann nuair a bheimid in ann an tír a athoscailt i gceart, agus nuair a bheidh turasóirí ag teacht ar ais go hÉirinn. Nuair a thagann na turasóirí sin, ní theastaíonn uainn go mbeidh na bailte tréigthe leis na daoine agus na teaghlaigh óga imithe go Meiriceá, chun na hAstráile nó chun na hEorpa mar a tharla i gcás chuile ghlúin roimhe seo.	spk_4
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-07-23	dail	33	Estimates for Public Services 2020	dbsect_23	Táimse ag tosú do Shinn Féin. Tá sé dochreidte go bhfuil muid anseo inniu ag plé athruithe airgeadais agus muid i lár paindéime. Sa tseachtain chéanna inar chlois muid go mbeidh Airí Stáit ag fáil ardú pá d'os cionn €16,000, tá daoine agus gnólachtaí faoi bhrú uafásach. Níl a fhios acu cén t-ioncam a bheidh acu sa todhchaí. Léiríonn an cinneadh seo nach bhfuil tuiscint ar bith ag an Rialtas ar shaol an gnáthdhuine. B'fhéidir, fiú, nach bhfuil suim ag an Rialtas i saol an ghnáthdhuine. This has been another chaotic week for the Government. Once again, it has proved itself to be completely out of touch with reality. On Tuesday, I questioned the Minister on the use of taxpayers' money for the hiring of excessive numbers of well-paid advisers, 17 in total, for the Taoiseach and the leader of the Green Party. That same evening, media sources reported that a decision had been made at Cabinet to increase the wages of the three super junior Ministers by €16,000. Does the Government need a reality check? In the middle of a pandemic, a wage increase of €16,000 is massive. Are they called super junior Ministers because they have some kind of superpower? Unless they do actually have superpowers, I do not understand why the Government thinks they need an extra €16,000 in income. In regard to the Revised Estimates, the manner in which the information has been presented to us is lacking in specific detail and does not allow for as much scrutiny as we would like. A consistent approach to performance budgeting, including metrics on financial allocations, would help to facilitate more effective scrutiny, which is surely in the public interest. In addition, it would be helpful if there were a proper breakdown of capital expenditure into subsections for the acquisition of new non-current assets versus the enhancement of existing ones. I am aware that there will be a difference in how capital expenditure and current expenditure can be reported given that the former must go through several stages before construction begins. Nevertheless, greater clarity and transparency could be provided on forthcoming capital expenditure projects that are proceeding to the implementation stage. With regard to capital expenditure, there should be no doubt, in the midst of an economic crisis, that we need shovel-ready projects that will put people directly to work in good jobs and support ancillary jobs in local communities. We need strong procurement contracts and to move away from the cost overruns we have seen in the past. We need the inclusion of social clauses that allow people to get jobs in their communities and enable apprentices to be taken on and upskilled. There is an opportunity for the Minister to do this right. However, as I alluded to, the lack of detail in the Revised Estimates makes it more difficult to know what the capital expenditure consists of. In my own constituency, there are numerous badly needed capital projects, many of which have already been subject to a cost-benefit analysis and given initial approval. The much-needed Inis Oírr pier development, for example, was promised in 2015 under the Government's capital investment plan, Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-21. It is now more than four years since that plan was published but no works have been done on the pier. I put in a parliamentary question on this issue to the previous Minister, who was unable to give an exact update as to when the works would commence. This is a critical piece of infrastructure for Inis Oírr. The project is essential for public safety as well as being fundamental to the survival and sustainability of the island's economy. The development of Inis Oírr pier cannot be rowed back on by the Government under any circumstance. Another example of a project in my constituency that has not progressed is the development of Rossaveel Harbour in Connemara. A cost-benefit analysis report on the proposed deepwater quay was undertaken by DKM Economic Consultants for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, following which planning permission was sought and obtained in 2018 for the new development. However, there has been no further movement on the project and the people of Rossaveel and Connemara have been left in the dark, with no explanation or justification for this lack of action and progress. The report clearly states that the development of a deepwater quay in Rossaveel is a worthwhile project that would yield significant and substantial benefits for the local economy in terms of tourism and employment, something that is made all the more pressing in the current economic climate. I strongly welcome the funding that is to go towards flooding prevention. It is absolutely essential for Galway, the west and the midlands. We have seen time and again the devastation that flooding can visit on communities, businesses and family homes. It is essential that the work is done to alleviate it. I have a question regarding the allocation to the secret service. I have seen an indication that there will be a 60% increase in this provision from €900,000 in 2019 to an estimated €2 million this year. I would like clarity as to the accuracy of that apparent jump.	spk_181

Sinn Féin has consistently stated since the onset of this crisis that these are extraordinary times which necessitate extraordinary measures. Many SMEs are starved of capital right now. The reality is that these businesses are the backbone of our economy and provide much needed employment in the most rural and remote areas in the State. They have, I am sure, contacted every single one of us to tell us they cannot cope with the onset of Covid-19. For many this also involves the changes they will need to make to their businesses in order for them to be in line with public health advice. These people, families and communities need to know we are doing everything in our power to ensure their survival. For many rural areas the survival of these small and micro-businesses impacts on the survival of communities. One group of businesses that is gravely concerned about their livelihoods are the owners of bed and breakfast accommodation. The tourism industry has fallen to its knees in recent months. I spoke with one owner of bed and breakfast accommodation yesterday who told me she had not had a single knock on her door since March, meaning that she has had no income since then. A woman to whom I spoke highlighted the fact that she was a pensioner and, therefore, was ineligible for the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment. As I have said in the Chamber, people have told me they are working not as a hobby but because they have bills and mortgages to pay. They are unable to survive without this income. A key issue for the owners of bed and breakfast accommodation is that they are non-ratable businesses because they are businesses which are run in homes. Therefore, certain grants are not available to them. Another owner of bed and breakfast accommodation told me it was estimated to cost in the region of €40,000 to make all of the necessary changes to be in line with public health advice. This person has a mortgage that still needs to be paid, no visitors are knocking on the door and grants cannot be accessed. The family told me they do not think they would be able to get a loan from a bank. Non-ratable businesses need access to grants and assurances in the credit guarantee scheme. Clearly, the scheme is there to assist businesses in acquiring much-needed capital so they can stay in business and preserve jobs.  Several problems with the scheme have been highlighted by my colleagues in recent days. Today I would like to draw the attention of the House to another issue, namely, the timeliness of the appeals process for SMEs that have had their initial applications for finance turned down. For many SMEs whose loan requests have been turned down by their respective banks, they will first have to exhaust their banks' internal appeals process before they can take an appeal to the Credit Review Office which acts as a type of ombudsman. It overturns, on average, more than 50% of the appeals decisions that come before it. Nevertheless, while it offers borrowers an independent review and, therefore, the right to an impartial appeal, this can be time consuming for many SMEs. Given our current predicament, many small businesses simply cannot afford to wait up to three months while they exhaust their banks' internal appeals processes before they can appeal to the Credit Review Office.  I ask the Minister to consider putting in place a mechanism which would allow SMEs which have had their requests for funding turned down by their banks to bypass internal appeals processes and be able to take appeals straight to the Credit Review Office, and that such a policy would remain in place for the duration of the Covid-19 crisis. Furthermore, could the appeals fee, which ranges from €100 to €250, depending on the size of the credit involved, be refunded to the applicant given the current emergency? If this would put too much pressure on the Credit Review Office and would simply move the backlog from banks to the appeals process, could the Minister request that banks establish internal dedicated credit guarantee appeals teams that would be responsible for assessing appeals within a short turnaround timeframe? If an applicant is not satisfied with this appeal, he or she could bring the matter to the Credit Review Office. I would be also interested in hearing whether the Minister, in the event he can proceed with this proposal, could also commit to ensuring the figures on the rates of refusals and declines for loan applications and appeals are published. This would alleviate a lot of the fears out there.	spk_6

Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-07-14	dail	33	Financial Provisions (Covid-19) Bill 2020: Second Stage	dbsect_31	The provisions of this Bill which are designed to allow Ireland to access the various European funding supports are welcome but questions remain on whether they go far enough, how they will be utilised and to what end. According to the OECD, average employment will remain below pre-crisis levels by the end of 2021, which is the date the initial investment period of the pan-European guarantee fund ends, after which time any extension will need to be approved by the contributors. I have concerns that were this extension to need unanimous approval at a period when the crisis could be at its height, it could become the subject of a political battle among member states at the worst possible time and thus be dead in the water. We should not forget the turmoil of the past decade over whether the eurozone itself would survive. We need to remember that this affects people's lives. Come December 2021, if the OECD's unemployment predictions prove to be correct, and I fear they may be overly optimistic, there will be people standing at the edge of the cliff not knowing what the future holds. We should be clear that the host of measures contained in this package, while welcome, are at best a workaround. The proposals for eurobonds and the mutualisation of debt still represent the best way out of this quagmire and the European Stability Mechanism remains highly unpopular among member states due to all the conditional structural reforms it entails, which is code for fiscal austerity and a recipe for economic disaster. The European Investment Bank's pan-European guarantee fund will provide working capital to SMEs, which my party believes need to be supported during the crisis as they are the backbone of our economy. For instance, rural Connemara will suffer considerably due to lack of tourism. We need to ensure that the small and medium-sized businesses can get the funds they need to ride out the storm of the Covid crisis and ensure that they can survive and continue to provide jobs in their locality. For mid-caps and corporates that are deemed viable in the long term but are struggling due to the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the guarantee fund will also make funds available. For these companies receiving funds, the way for the State to optimise its return should be through loans that are convertible to equity for the successful firms, while making provisions which allow these firms to buy these shares back at a later date. All talk of fiscal prudence which does not seek to maximise the return to the State is just that; talk. It is also worth highlighting that the pan-European guarantee fund allows for 7% of its funds to be allocated to venture capitalists and private equity. Given private equity's often poor track record of saddling companies with debt, stripping their assets, raiding their pension funds and then laying off their employees, what mechanisms will be put in place to ensure that this does not happen? From my perspective, we need to ensure that this funding goes to small and medium-sized enterprises. The SURE scheme temporary support to mitigate unemployment risk is to be welcomed as it seeks to save jobs, and as we know from the previous crisis, a failure to protect jobs is a failure to protect people's livelihood and a sure-fire way to exacerbate economic inequality. Nevertheless, it mandates that every member state contributes to the guarantee in proportion to its relative share in the total gross national income of the Union. As a result, it is estimated that we will be putting €483 million into this scheme. As has now been well documented, GNI is a poor measure of the health of the Irish economy - something that has even been acknowledged by the Central Statistics Office which has constructed its own modified GNI measure which attempts to remove distortion from profit-shifting. Unfortunately, for Ireland, the latter measure is not used internationally, meaning the standard over-inflated GNI measure will be utilised and Ireland is likely to contribute more and potentially receive less funding due to the inaccurate picture of the economy. I hope the Minister will raise that with his European counterparts. In closing, I wish to raise two general concerns. First, there is a likely reluctance on the part of the Government to draw down as much funds as possible due to its conservative ideological bias, which runs the risk of not providing enough investment to counteract the downturn. In other words, the risk is that we do too little rather than too much. Second, the more market-friendly approach that this Government will take means that these de facto State subsidies could be used to support the private sector's interest at the expense of public enterprise. We should not forget the crises in housing, education and the healthcare sector. These are the front-line staff who we were quick to clap but slow to reward. We should be clear that what these funds constitute is massive State subsidies to Europe's private sector. Following the previous crisis, as the public sector was forced to bail out the financial sector, that same sector then turned around and told us that the large public debts and deficits were evidence that we were living beyond our means. This has accurately been described as the biggest bait-and-switch in history. Today, European states will not be bailing out the financial sector, but in many cases the wider corporate sector. I would certainly hope that many of these corporates will remember that in a few years' time when the austerians come calling.	spk_226

We absolutely support the call for a system to deal with rent arrears. The Government inaction on this will just leave more children in homeless accommodation. We in Sinn Féin have been calling for this issue to be tackled for some time. We know from data published by the ESRI that young people and those renting are more likely to be in a more precarious situation with regard to their income due to Covid-19 restrictions. We know that since the special Covid-19 rent supplement payment was introduced in March that the number of claims has increased by almost 40%. We in Sinn Féin hosted a survey of renters which showed that 60% of those who took part had lost income because of Covid-19 and a similar number were really concerned about mounting rent arrears. Some 68% of renters in our survey expected to have arrears of up to €3,000 while a further 13% expected the debt to be as much as €5,000. The moratorium on evictions and the ban on rent increases is due to end on 20 July. The Government must extend the ban on evictions until at least the end of 2020. It must also extend the access to the Covid-19 rent supplement payment until the end of the year. Not doing so will have disastrous consequences for people across this State and in my county, Galway. The Simon Community has reported a drop in people entering emergency accommodation in Galway, which is as a direct result of the ban on evictions and rent increases. There is no doubt that once this ban is lifted, there will be a wave of new homelessness, not to mention mortgage arrears.By stopping the banks from charging penalties or surcharges on mortgage arrears accrued during the pandemic and extending the ban on evictions, we can provide certainty for individuals and families as well as avoiding a potentially dangerous spiral of mortgage arrears and evictions that will cause untold distress for families throughout the State.	spk_135

These political forces are acting not in the national interest but in their own political and electoral interests.

Fine Gael is doing everything in its power to reject the political change for which the people voted in February.

Ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil sé dochreidte agus go hiomlán do-ghlactha nár tugadh deis dúinn an Ghaeltacht a phlé go dtí seo agus nach mbeidh plé iomlán air seo os comhair na Dála mar is os comhair an Choiste Speisialta um Fhreagra ar Covid-19 a bheidh sé seo á phlé. Tá na ceantair Ghaeltachta buailte go dona ag an bpaindéim seo agus ba chóir go mbeadh sé pléite ann cheana féin leis an Aire sinsearach, a bhfuil dualgais aici maidir leis an nGaeltacht. A Aire, we are in a climate emergency and we need action to be taken by every sector to ensure that we fulfil and deliver on our targets. The restrictions on movement over the past few months have provided people with an opportunity to visit local woodlands and beaches. I live in Galway city and I am very lucky that Merlin Park Woods and Ballyloughane beach are within a 2 km radius of my home. Merlin Park Woods is a fantastic amenity for those living in the large estates in the area. It is a fantastic amenity owing to the work carried out there by Friends of Merlin Woods, a voluntary organisation which has kept it to the fore. For us to ensure our woodlands, beaches and heritage sites remain fantastic amenities this work should be led by local councils. They should not be solely reliant on voluntary organisations.  Another interesting point in regard to the past few months is that many people have for the first time visited local heritage sites in their area.An absolutely fantastic resource that so many people I know used was the historic environment map viewer. This documents the different historic sites and monuments across Ireland and it gave people an opportunity to look at those sites within a 2 km radius of their homes. There was an awful lot of excitement when the latter changed to 5 km and people could look at the viewer again. This shows the importance of these sites and of ensuring that they are not allowed to become dilapidated, which is unfortunately the case for many of them. This year has shown us the importance, for everyone, of our own local cultural sites in our local areas, especially if we are looking to promote holidaying at home. The Minister mentioned the upgrading of these sites and that is absolutely essential. I also want to raise an issue relating to the arts sector. The arts sector has long been very vocal and to the forefront on heritage, promoting climate action and so on. For example, the green arts initiative has worked with Creative Carbon Scotland and that has been organised through Theatre Forum Ireland. Their work has shown that while venues have a lack of environmental policies, 80% of them have green ambassadors in their organisation. This shows clearly that there is a willingness to make theatres more green. However, the supports might not be in place. What role is the Department playing in supporting venues, theatres and arts centres to develop their own environmental policies in order to ensure that work continues? This comes on the back of the fact that I am from Galway. If we are looking to promote the environment and our heritage, it is very important that it is involved in everything we do. Galway had the honour of being awarded the European Capital of Culture 2020. There was a huge amount of buzz and excitement about it and it included all different aspects of organisations, though there have been issues with it since. Has a formal request been made to extend the Galway European Capital of Culture programme 2020? As a result of the Covid-19 restrictions, many of the events that had been planned, which would have promoted the culture, environment and heritage of Galway city and county, have been cancelled.	spk_49
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-06-10	dail	33	July Education Programme: Statements	dbsect_6	Mar gheall go bhfuil srian ar mo chuid ama, iarraim ar an Aire na freagraí a thabhairt i bhfoirm scríofa. It is not often that a meeting is so emotional that it reduces me to tears, but two weeks ago I had just such a meeting with the parents' association of Rosedale School, a school for children with severe or profound intellectual disability in Galway city which was featured on RTÉ news last week. These parents are exhausted and heartbroken. Many of their children require 24-7 care which means the parents need to take shifts overnight to mind the children. The children in this school represent a tiny percentage of children with special educational needs, yet they are the most vulnerable and at risk. They feel completely ignored and isolated by the Government. Rosedale is not simply a school for these children, but their only social setting outside of their family home. They receive supports such as speech and language therapy and occupational therapy and they learn life skills and independence. The children have received no support from these services since Rosedale closed and the parents can see the detrimental effect this is having on their children's development and their children are regressing. They told me very clearly that their lifeline is gone. One parent said: “It has taken years of dedicated hard work and consultation with many multidisciplinary professionals to help my son regulate and engage to this level, and as is probably clear by now since March 12th my son's whole world has fallen apart.” Another parent said: “When I look at him now my heart breaks, I think he has regressed by about five years in the last number of weeks and it is unbearable for me to consider the implications any further delay in returning to his beloved Rosedale will have for him.” The parents have told me they need a school-based summer programme and that an online programme will not work for their children. They need to know first when it will run and second what staff are available. Some SNAs have had their contracts moved to the HSE to enable them to work in children's homes. Will their contracts need to be reverted prior to the commencement of the summer programme? If the programme is delayed into August, what provision will be made for the required nurses who take their leave in August? These are not just schools for these children and families - they are their hospitals and their social settings, and they bring so much joy to these kids. One father said to me that while he knows his daughter has a life-limiting condition and does not like to say it, all he wants is for her to be as happy as possible while she is with them. These parents are deeply concerned that if a second wave hits Ireland, these schools will be closed again. Can this service be reclassified as an essential service, given that the children's needs are more complex and their conditions are far more profound than children in other schools? The class sizes are limited to between four and six pupils, with many of the children having limited movement. The teachers have control over hygiene and are fully versed in infection control. Given the hardship on families, along with the regression of the physical, social and mental development of these children, can these schools reopen immediately? One mother described the big smile on her little daughter’s face when she sees the school bus coming. The Minister can put that smile back on that child's face and I urge him to do so.	spk_71

There is a lot of concern in our coastal areas and our island communities about the severe economic impact Covid-19 will have over the summer months and the knock-on effect it will have both on internal and external tourism. As the Minister is aware, these regions rely heavily on tourism at this time of the year as a source of temporary employment as an economic boost to the hospitality industry in particular. In many cases, that is critical in sustaining communities throughout the remainder of the year but this crisis hits Gaeltacht communities twofold. Not only will there be a severe drop in tourist numbers but the coláistí samhraidh na Gaeltachta courses have also been rightly cancelled due to public health. However, we cannot seem to get a clear answer on the financial supports available to mna tí agus fir tí who will be losing a significant part of their annual income as a direct result of this announcement.Tá réigiúin na Gaeltachta ar na ceantair thuaithe is mó atá buailte ag an dífhostaíocht agus buailfear iad i bhfad níos measa de bharr na cinntí seo, ós rud é gur beag na deiseanna eile fostaíochta a bhíonn ar fáil ann. Tá sé go hiomlán scannalach an chaoi a bhfuiltear ag caitheamh leis na ceantair Ghaeltachta le linn na paindéime seo. What support measures does the Minister plan to introduce for those people who rely on the income they receive over the summer period through temporary seasonal employment? I was also contacted last week by an NUI Galway student from Clifden who told me that he did not know how he will be able to afford to go back to college next year, as seasonal employment provides him with an opportunity to work and save money at home each summer so that when he goes back to Galway, he can stay in digs and have some money to pay for meals, bus fares and books.	spk_53
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-05-28	dail	33	Estimates for Public Services 2020	dbsect_3	As a full-time student he is not eligible for unemployment assistance and due to the fact that he was not working in March, he cannot get the Covid-19 payment. What can we do to ensure that he can go back to college in September? The last issue I want to raise is that of those over the age of 66. I will read out a heartbreaking email that I got from a constituent which shows the real-life impact of this on those over the age of 66. It states:I am 68 and prior to the coronavirus pandemic, I was working as a bus driver, bringing children with disabilities from rural areas to their schools. Now that the pandemic has shut down schools, I have been put out of work.I was not working just to pass time - I have a mortgage and bills to pay. My wife is 59 and is battling terminal cancer, and therefore unable to work. I am in receipt of the old age pension - however we depend on my wages to survive.What can I tell this person? Since time has been cut short, I ask the Minister to respond in writing.	spk_55
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-05-27	dail	33	Covid-19 (Local Government): Statements	dbsect_10	Roinnfidh mé m'am idir mé féin agus an tAire Stáit. Beidh thart ar trí nóiméad agam féin agus nóiméad amháin aige. I will share my time with the Minister of State. I will use approximately three minutes myself and give a minute to the Minister of State to respond. Last week a report was published that revealed that only four councils in the State collected the vacant sites levy, which means that 27 did not collect these vital funds for the provision of much needed housing. This report shows that millions are owed to councils. We are speaking of a sum greater than €9 million. This is deeply concerning to me and is also of great concern to the people I represent. We need far greater clarity on the collection of both the vacant sites levy and the derelict sites levy.  Just down the road from where I live in Galway city, there is a dilapidated building on the site of the former Corrib Great Southern Hotel. This is one of the most prominent locations on the east side of the city and one of the first buildings one passes when entering Galway. Not only is it an eyesore, a waste of valuable space in Galway city and a fire hazard, but it has also been on the derelict sites register since January 2015, well over five years ago. Despite numerous requests and a freedom of information application from me, there is no clarity on the levies that have been paid to Galway City Council in this regard. That is simply not good enough. It is very clear that we need far greater transparency regarding what is owed and where.  In the middle of a housing crisis, we cannot afford to have land lying idle in our urban areas. In the middle of a global pandemic, we cannot afford to leave €9 million in uncollected levies. As we have heard today, local authorities are being squeezed for funding and, in light of the impact the coronavirus is having on local economies, we know that they will be squeezed even further. It therefore makes no sense not to collect these levies. Tá géarchéim ann maidir le maoiniú do chomhairlí áitiúla. Ba chóir aon airgead atá dlite don rialtas áitiúil a bhailiú mar gheall go bhfuil sé ag teastáil go géar. While certain Deputies are getting hot under the collar claiming that €350 is an excessive weekly income, there is little mention of the €9 million in uncollected levies. That tells us a lot of where the political focus is and the understanding of what it is like to struggle to put food on the table and to keep a roof over one's head. Mar sin, tá trí cheist agam for the Minister of State. One, why is this money not being collected? Two, do local authorities require greater powers to collect it? Three, can the amounts paid and owed for the derelict site levy be published? Public funds should be public knowledge.	spk_328
Mairead Farrell	39	Unknown	Galway West	#MaireadFarrell	2020-02-20	dail	33	Nomination of Taoiseach	dbsect_10	Gabhaim comhghairdeas leis an gCeann Comhairle as a bheith atofa inniu. Is mór an onóir dó é agus is mór an onóir dom féin a bheith tofa mar Theachta Dála do Ghaillimh agus do Mhaigh Eo. Gabhaim buíochas leo siúd a chaith vóta dom agus dóibh siúd a thug cabhair dom le linn an fheachtais. Seo an chéad uair dom a bheith ag labhairt sa Seomra seo. Is pribhléid é an óráid seo a úsáid chun mo thacaíocht a thabhairt d’ainmniú mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Mary Lou McDonald mar Thaoiseach. It is a huge honour for me to use my maiden speech to support the nomination of Deputy Mary Lou McDonald for Taoiseach. It is not only an honour; it is also a necessity for all those who have had enough and who have suffered for far too long under the politics of the haves and the have-nots. We need a different type of politics and a different kind of Taoiseach. We need a Taoiseach who will put the ordinary person front and centre, who understands that a society that cannot house its people or take care of its ill is not functioning correctly, and who understands that that is a result of political choices. That Taoiseach is very clearly Deputy Mary Lou McDonald agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh léi anocht. 	spk_98
