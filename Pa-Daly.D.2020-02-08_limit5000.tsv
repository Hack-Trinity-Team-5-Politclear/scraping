Pa Daly	44	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2024-02-21	dail	33	Healthcare Provision in Rural Communities: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I thank the Rural Independent Group for bringing forward this worthy motion. This may well be the seventh anniversary of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare's Sláintecare Report. Despite the commitment to ending the two-tier system contained within the health service, little progress has been made. This is especially the case in the context of GP care. The Sláintecare Report states: A new GP contract is due to be negotiated in 2017. The new contract provides an opportunity for the GPs to provide the core leadership role in delivering care outside of hospital in multidisciplinary primary care teams.I get slightly jealous when I hear some of my colleagues from the cities talking about primary care centres because there is a big absence of them in rural areas. The report goes on to statePotentially, GPs will be hired as salaried HSE staff in areas where it is hard to attract them. In order to extend primary care to the whole population more GPs and primary care staff are needed ... It is obvious that in some rural areas, qualified GPs do not want to work five days a week. They do not want to work weekends, but they will work two or three days a week. Directly employing them would find a solution in order that they could go in. In recent years, I have seen, in Ballyduff, Milltown and other areas around Kerry, how it has been difficult to attract a GP who wants to sign up to the HSE contract. The lack of progress that has been made in the past seven years with regard to GP cover is disappointing. County Kerry has a high degree of rural isolation and peripherality. In that context, appropriate GP care is key. Campaigns such as the one in Clare - known as No Doctor, No Village - highlight the importance of GPs to rural communities. The most recent Sláintecare progress report up to May 2023 merely states that there is a strategic review of GP services, setting out measures to ensure that sustainable services into the future should be approved. Terms of reference have been published but little else seems to have occurred. All the time, communities suffer, and some right-wing forces have then stirred division by pointing out the lack of services in rural areas. I would like to say that there have been difficulties in the Ring of Kerry, Killarney and other areas around Kerry long before 70 people arrived at the Muckross Road. It is very divisive and irresponsible of some Deputies to raise this as an issue that is only caused by migrants. With GP care under pressure in County Kerry, there are other solutions to salaried GPs. Pharmacists, as has already been stated, could be engaged to ensure late-night options are available across the State. I was interested to see that the NHS in England made similar suggestions so that in specific conditions, patients can be prescribed medicine by pharmacists without the need to see a doctor. There is also a constant demand for patients to avoid accident and emergency departments. It came to my attention recently that a constituent from Ballybunion who had a heart difficulty went into an accident and emergency department. The following day, some 11 hours later, they left and went to a hospital in Dublin instead. That cannot continue. Pharmacists can be suitable for some of these functions, and it should be explored to free up GP appointments and accident and emergency departments for more urgent care. I know that the hospital in Kerry has a capital submission in to have a minor injuries clinic on the same campus but outside of the accident and emergency department, which will free that up, in addition to some other capital submissions. I will finish on this point. The minor injuries clinic in Gurranabraher in Cork has been very successful.	spk_38

The room has no bed. It is not the responsibility of University Hospital Kerry - that is not the place for him. This is a human rights violation because the disability services have not acted. The boy is a former CAMHS patient. I was told by his mother that he had ADHD and moderate autism but was put on antipsychotic medication when he was eight years old. He has received an apology for the deficits in his care but has long-term side effects as a result of this medication. You would think he would be prioritised and fast-tracked to get the help he deserves and needs. Instead, he is in a windowless room off the emergency department. Will the Taoiseach step in to ensure he receives immediate short-term residential treatment close to home, not 300 km away, so his mother can visit him as often as she wishes?	spk_142

Pa Daly	44	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2024-02-14	dail	33	Transfer of Passenger Name Record Data: Motions	dbsect_18	"As the Minister stated, PNR data is the information provided by passengers and collected and held in the reservation systems of the carriers for commercial purposes. The content during book in and check in may also include personal data of people on their own or with other people. This can assist authorities in identifying criminals. Like yesterday’s debate about facial recognition technology or data at the justice committee, the holding of any such data must be necessary, proportionate and subject to strict limitations. We agree it is desirable that Ireland should share and receive PNR data with these three Schengen associated countries. We will not oppose the Government motion. However, these debates are always welcome as they provide an opportunity to tease out some of the issues and assert our subsidiarity as regards decision-making. We should be mindful of how we exercise the State's sovereignty. While co-operation is important, we must retain our own powers, especially where civil liberties are affected. These concerns are balanced against the need to ensure the safety and security of our own citizens, as well as those of other European partner states, regardless of whether they are in the EU. The Commission states that the transfer of PNR data is key to allowing authorities to strengthen the detection, prosecution and investigation of terrorist and criminal offences. International criminal gangs are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their operation and the methods used to combat them are becoming increasingly transnational. I note in particular the recent remarks by UN Secretary General António Guterres, who said that organised crime leads to ""weakened governance, corruption and lawlessness, open violence, death and destruction"". He further stated: ""Transnational and organized crime and conflict feed off each other. Crime is a catalyst for conflict. And when conflict rages, crime thrives."" I also note recent reports as well of remarks by the Garda Commissioner relating to the links between organised crime, gangs and the far-right. Conflict and division is being fostered so that some can profit from it. The solution, at home and abroad, is co-operation to counteract these threats. This is one of three priorities mentioned by the Secretary General, with the others being the rule of law and prevention of crime. The motion and the proposal speak to all of these concerns and the agreements before us will, according to the Commission, set out the conditions for the transfer of PNR data to the authorities of those countries with full respect of data protection safeguards and fundamental rights. The effectiveness of PNR data was demonstrated by a Commission report in 2020, relating to the applicable EU framework on PNR data, which is EU Directive 2016/681. This report found that the majority of member states established fully operational passenger information units, which are the units responsible for collecting and processing PNR data. I understand Spain was referred to the Court of Justice of the EU for its failure to transpose the directive. These units become the chief units of co-operation to establish good relationships with their equivalents in other member states. This will presumably be the case with the three countries mentioned in the motion, and we should insist on proper co-ordination as much as possible. The report also expanded on the data protection safeguards contained in the directive, which are focused on purpose and proportionality. The purpose limitation ensures that data processing is only carried out for the objectives of fighting terrorism or serious crime. Proportionality is also addressed by the maintenance of records of processing operations as required by the directive, which allows for transparency and lawfulness. The more important guarantor of civil liberties is the actual data that is processed. Under the directive, the processing of PNR data concerns all passengers on inbound and outbound extra-EU flights. The report claims that such broad coverage is strictly necessary to achieve the directive's objectives. The PNR directive strictly prohibits the processing of sensitive data. While the PNR data can obviously reveal some private details, such information is limited to air travel. As a result of the safeguards employed, only the personal data of a limited number of passengers is transferred to competent authorities for further processing. This again will surely be important in any negotiations with the other states. In terms of the proposals themselves, this data is already collected by commercial airlines and is used for the obvious purposes of directing passengers to their destinations. Iceland, Norway and Switzerland - the Schengen associated countries - are highly interconnected with other EU states. Switzerland aside, they are members of the European Economic Area, EEA. It is fair to say that all three are countries where the rule of law is strong, and respect for civil liberties is paramount. The proposal  With regard to negotiations and Ireland's role in same, the Government's approach increasingly seems to be to opt in. That the opt-in continues and we continue to exercise it is important, and I do not doubt that there are political considerations as well as policy or legal considerations when it comes to dealing with other European states. At the same time, these guarantees were hard won, and we should continue to exercise them without any presumption that opt-ins are a formality. Each proposal needs to be considered on its own merits. We receive regular updates on these in the justice committee. The merits of the proposal are strong and we will not oppose the passage of the motion."	spk_172
Pa Daly	44	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2024-02-14	dail	33	Coroners (Amendment) Bill 2024: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_20	I move amendment No. 1:In page 12, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:“On the Bill, it is worth saying we are not opposing its passage. It is disappointing that the Bill only contains piecemeal reforms. It has clearly been moved in response to a deadline for the Dublin coroner's office. I am sure representatives will agree when I say the entire service is in need of some reform. While there are difficult issues in relation to independence and continuity of service, reform is long overdue. The founding Act goes back, I think, to 1962. It has been through the Committee on Justice, which published a report of which I am sure the Minister is aware. It covers much of the previous ground, as does the ICCL report. In this amendment, we ask that not more than one year after the commencement of sections 1 to 12, the Government shall bring forward legislation to reform the Coroners Acts, having due regard to the recommendations contained in the committee report on an examination of the operation of the Coroner Service. It concerns the opaque nature of the appointment process. Recently, someone who I thought would be a very qualified candidate asked for clarity. He - an educated man - could not make head nor tail of how the whole process was going to work and how he could apply for what he anticipated might be an upcoming vacancy. He could not see any transparent application process or expressions of interest in the appointment of a coroner. The post seems to be passed to a deputy nominated by the outgoing coroner prior to their retirement. That is how it seems to work. The salary is funded by the local authority but that body does not choose to make an input to the selection process. Section 8 of the Coroners Act grants the power to appoint coroners to the local authority but this needs to change. Coroners should be centrally employed and funded, not from the coffers of the hard-pressed local authority. While there are other provisions that allow for the appointment of a deputy coroner and the merging of districts, the open advertising of any role, which should be the normal course of action for a public service vacancy, does not take place. I find it hard to think anybody would disagree with that. That man said he made inquiries with Kerry County Council about the issue which came to naught. While the legislation dictates that the council is responsible for the appointment, there is nothing that stops the council from using the public appointments process to find qualified persons. Does the Minister have a view on this? Officials from the Committee on Justice will arrive presently, or, I hope, before the end of this Dáil sitting.	spk_229

Pa Daly	44	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2024-01-31	dail	33	Misuse of Drugs (Cannabis Regulation) Bill 2022: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_8	"I thank People Before Profit for introducing this Bill. Clearly, a new way is needed for the State’s drug policy. A report of the justice committee last year recommended a policy of decriminalisation be pursued in line with emerging international best practice in respect of the possession of drugs for personal consumption through appropriate legislative reform in favour of a health-led approach to problem drug use. The final report of the citizens’ assembly was split. It does not go so far as to call for possession to be totally decriminalised or for the repeal of the Misuse of Drugs Act but it gives a decision back to the Oireachtas saying that possession of controlled drugs would remain illegal, changes are likely to be required to the Misuse of Drugs Act in conjunction with the enhanced use of probation, etc. and that new legislation may also be required. In my view, an overhaul of the Misuse of Drugs Act is probably necessary. The recommendation continues that the citizens assembly “views it as the responsibility of the Oireachtas, informed by legal advice and detailed pre-legislative scrutiny, to determine the most appropriate legal mechanisms to achieve this goal"". My personal view is the consequences of criminalising mostly younger men is vastly disproportionate to the act which has led to the charge. Potentially career-ending consequences and limitations on travel from even a charge which is unproven or does not result in a conviction being applied is not the fairest or most just way to deal with people smoking cannabis. I saw in my own career people being charged with pieces left on a grinder, traces of cannabis of less than even 1 g. My experience has been that this system often led to young, often vulnerable men, being pressurised into providing information on potentially dangerous individuals to avoid a charge or conviction. This, at least, causes further stress. There was mention of the powers under the Misuse of Drugs Act in relation to detention. There can be no other conclusion but that it is often used in a random fashion. For years, the offence of simple possession was excluded from the adult caution scheme but even since it was included, the amount of charges remain high. My figures are that there were 5,900 for 2021. I had not seen the 2022 figures but I would be interested in looking at those.However, at the same time, I have met people - family members - who say that as a result of taking drugs and with the increased potency of cannabis, there is a danger to young people, again, particularly to young men. A one-size-fits-all approach cannot succeed. The Bill proposes to amend section 3 to make the possession of up to 7 g of cannabis lawful provided that the circumstances are such that a reasonable inference can be drawn that the drugs are for the personal use of the individual. Section 3 of this Bill places the burden of proof, strangely, on the defendant then rather than the State. Last year, the Supreme Court struck down other laws that placed the onus of proof on the defendant so it is a very tricky area. Placing the onus on the defendants means that they will obviously be already before the court and may be obliged to give evidence. Any further inroads into the right to silence should be approached with extreme caution.  However, the amount of 7 g suggested seems comparable with international norms. Malta, for instance, uses a similar yardstick but what is more problematic may be the reasonable inference. Could it be more prudent for the Bill to provide that no prosecution would be initiated or maintained if the amount was below a certain threshold and there is no evidence the person is dealing, rather than saying that it shall be lawful? Is this apropos of the defence or of a request or command to the DPP not to prosecute? This can all be teased out later. One suggestion is that no proceedings should be brought and another suggestion is that in proceedings relating to this amount, the onus would be on the defendant to prove something. Another potential issue is that in one section of the Bill to amend section 3 refers to a person over the age of 18 years so how does it apply to somebody who is 17? The Bill is clearly not the finished product. Sinn Féin has approached this debate with an open mind to see if the issues, both positive and negative, can be teased out on Committee Stage. A special Oireachtas committee has been recommended. As legislators it is now our job to listen to the decision of the citizen's assembly and to implement solutions. At this point there are wider considerations than just criminal law and my colleagues, Deputies Gould and Ward, have also undertaken extensive work in the fields of mental health, rehabilitation and the treatment of addiction. The current legislative framework is far from perfect but we need to see health impact and other assessments."	spk_26

It has long been my view that the existing building in Tralee should be refurbished in accordance with the town centre first plan of this Government, the lack of a plan to do anything with the existing building and the need for extra help for Tralee town centre which, like a lot of places, suffers with a lot of vacant units. All along, the Courts Service has been saying that the court had to move because it was shoehorned into the current site. However, recently the Protestant Hall has come up for sale and now preparations are being made by An Post to move the distribution centre at the end of this year. Common sense is screaming at the Courts Service to refurbish the existing building with an imaginative approach. Will the Government discuss this with the Courts Service and An Post to make an extra site available? It is ten years, by the way, since the Kerry Group donated the Denny site with all the potential it would have for social housing, options for the community to gather and new jobs in the town centre.

Pa Daly	44	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2024-01-24	dail	33	Road Projects	dbsect_3	The Minister of State is familiar with the CAMHS disaster that occurred between 2016 and 2021. That is the identified period for which there was overprescription of medication and inappropriate care. Children experienced massive weight gain. Risperidone was nearly universally applied and prescribed for children. Lives were ruined. Following the identification of some of the issues involved, the Maskey report was established. Following Maskey, a redress scheme was put in place to deal with children who were under the care of a particular doctor. However, the scheme is quite limited in that it deals with patients who were treated in south Kerry between 1 July 2016 and 19 April 2021. There is a fundamental unfairness in who is allowed into the scheme and who is excluded from it. The Minister of State probably has the exact figures, but there are an awful lot of children and parents who have received apologies for the treatment, or lack thereof, in its care in the Kerry region. Anybody who was treated in north Kerry who had the exact same difficulties as people who have been identified by Maskey are not included in this scheme and cannot access it. In addition, some patients in south Kerry whose treatment may have commenced prior to 1 July 2016 are also excluded from the scheme. What are the benefits of the scheme? One can avoid a lengthy and expensive civil litigation route. One is provided with €10,000 upfront in order to pay for medical reports that can often cost up to €3,500. It is only fair that the scheme be extended to all patients or former patients who have received the letters of apology so that they can avoid having to pay large sums of money, because it is an obstacle to justice for those people who the HSE has written to and apologised that their treatment was lacking and did not match the required standard of care that these people deserve. It has been a long road for them. Following Maskey, they were waiting a long time for various audits and other procedures to be established. They feel they have been strung along a bit. If any cohort of patients in this country now deserves a break and quick access to justice, it is them. Where apologies have already been received and when, in effect, there has been an admission of liability, why not save the State some money while providing easier access to justice for these people by extending the scheme so they can be included in it?	spk_2
Pa Daly	44	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2024-01-24	dail	33	Road Projects	dbsect_3	I thank the Minister of State for the reply. I accept it was acknowledged that 240 people did not receive an adequate standard of care. The problem is that anyone who does not meet these criteria, as the Minister of State said in the reply, is free to pursue a case separately with the HSE. An example of what we are dealing with in north Kerry in particular is the case of one young fellow who was a talented footballer, who had a social anxiety that was the most serious, was prescribed with Risperidone. He put on four or five stone. He was a talented footballer but he hardly leaves his room now. His life has been ruined. He is in his late 20s. He has lost contact with all of his peers. That is a case which is not included as part of the scheme. It is hard to understand why it cannot be. I know there was a small audit of 50 sample files. I was arguing that there should be a full review of all files. Some 16 out of 50 cases of concern have been identified but not all of those are included in the scheme. Why not save the State some money and expand the scheme and allow these people who have been wronged by the State - the State has been seriously negligent in their treatment - quicker access to justice? This is coming from the patients. It also comes from their legal representatives who feel that it would be much easier where an apology is issued and an admission of liability has been made, to get them into the scheme as soon as possible. These people are still dealing with the lasting physical effects of the treatment. It is an ongoing problem and they just do not need the extra hassle of a long civil litigation process.	spk_4

Pa Daly	44	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2024-01-24	dail	33	Mental Health Services	dbsect_4	The Minister of State is familiar with the CAMHS disaster that occurred between 2016 and 2021. That is the identified period for which there was overprescription of medication and inappropriate care. Children experienced massive weight gain. Risperidone was nearly universally applied and prescribed for children. Lives were ruined. Following the identification of some of the issues involved, the Maskey report was established. Following Maskey, a redress scheme was put in place to deal with children who were under the care of a particular doctor. However, the scheme is quite limited in that it deals with patients who were treated in south Kerry between 1 July 2016 and 19 April 2021. There is a fundamental unfairness in who is allowed into the scheme and who is excluded from it. The Minister of State probably has the exact figures, but there are an awful lot of children and parents who have received apologies for the treatment, or lack thereof, in its care in the Kerry region. Anybody who was treated in north Kerry who had the exact same difficulties as people who have been identified by Maskey are not included in this scheme and cannot access it. In addition, some patients in south Kerry whose treatment may have commenced prior to 1 July 2016 are also excluded from the scheme. What are the benefits of the scheme? One can avoid a lengthy and expensive civil litigation route. One is provided with €10,000 upfront in order to pay for medical reports that can often cost up to €3,500. It is only fair that the scheme be extended to all patients or former patients who have received the letters of apology so that they can avoid having to pay large sums of money, because it is an obstacle to justice for those people who the HSE has written to and apologised that their treatment was lacking and did not match the required standard of care that these people deserve.

Before he left, the Minister for agriculture dropped a statement which said that as the Tánaiste made clear, interventions by states are not about joining one side or another but about aiming to assert a legal interpretation of the issue at hand. That sounds to me like someone who is looking for an excuse not to do anything. It sounds to me like a Government that does not care. I support this motion, which calls on the Government to take its obligations under the genocide convention seriously. As far back as 16 November, UN experts highlighted evidence of increasing genocidal incitement against Palestinians. This is not a war, it is a series of illegal attacks. There is only one actor causing the destruction and that is Israel. When we have indiscriminate shelling, bombing and shooting; the denial of food, water and medical care; hospitals being attacked; debates being shut down; universities being taken over; children being slaughtered; famine being created; and people being rounded up in a ghetto, we have a clear picture of an attempt to ethnically cleanse Gaza. Human Rights Watch has accused the Israeli Government of using starvation as a weapon of war and of depriving civilians of the resources necessary for daily existence. Some 25,000 people are dead. That is every single person in the towns of Killarney, Castleisland, Dingle, Cahersiveen and Listowel. It is a systematic attempt to eliminate the Arab population. Nowhere and no one is safe in Gaza. We cannot stand idly by. We should light up Leinster House in the Palestinian colours, recognise the state of Palestine and implement the boycott, divestment and sanctions Bill.	spk_24

The bulk purchase of the 46 homes in Belcamp that were aimed at individual buyers has exposed the incompetence of the Government's plan and its lack of concern for home purchasers, homeless children, students, people on the housing waiting lists and older people. I will return to the latter group. In order to prevent this and disincentivise the vulture funds, Sinn Féin called for a higher rate of stamp duty to be applied to the purchase of homes by investment funds. It did so by tabling amendments to the Finance Bill in 2020 and by means of a Private Members' motion in May 2021, which the Government rejected. The Government was warned by Sinn Féin that belated measures introduced in May 2021 would be insufficient, but the Government opened the door for the continued bulk purchases by investment funds of homes aimed at individual buyers, with 630 such homes being purchased at that time at the expense of individual home buyers. I support this motion calling on the Government to introduce legislation to impose a stamp duty surcharge at a minimum rate of 17%. Earlier, I was sent a copy of the End Hedge Fund Control of American Homes Act, which was recently introduced in order to prevent vulture funds edging out purchasers by banning the hedge funds from buying single family homes and making them sell them off. While I have the Minister of State's attention, I want to raise with him an issue relating to older people. Some 600 to 700 people who are mostly elderly avail of the housing grant schemes in Kerry each year in the context of wet rooms, roofs, heating systems and bedroom and bathroom extensions. Quotes are now coming in for amounts that are way above the rate of inflation. The grants are capped at figures that were set a decade ago, so there is an increasing gap that has often to be filled by the elderly applicant who cannot afford it. I am asking for the cap relating to the grants to be raised."	spk_377

I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for facilitating it. I also thank the Bills Office and Lee Daly in my office. We would not be here without their help. Obviously, An Garda Síochána has to address crime, the causes of crime and the fear of crime. I am hopeful that restorative justice can take place at any point in the criminal process. The idea is it will address and repair the harm done by the offence through dialogue and reparation with others, and that it will address the harm done to people through face-to-face conversation and communication. It is important to remember that studies have consistently shown there is a 85% satisfaction rate with restorative justice among victims. The victims of crime legislation from 2017 allows a lot of discretion for judges. It is hoped that this Bill will clarify the processes and procedures, give victims closure, improve victim recovery and satisfaction rates, and maybe avoid penal sentences through helping offender rehabilitation and ending recidivism, which will free up an overburdened court and prison system.

Within the council's housing services, they have around 70 beds. Approximately 50 of these full, but they are just about managing because of their efforts to keep some beds in reserve. They are continually trying to source more beds. Much of their efforts are focused on keeping people out of emergency accommodation. They are engaging with clients to see what can be done, as once they are in, they know that it will be difficult to get them back out. Two or three notices to quit are coming in every day. We recently dealt with a man in his 70s who has a notice to quit for February. The landlord is insisting that he leave. Another visually impaired man had a notice to quit for 19 December next. The level of anxiety that he was dealing with was unbelievable. Luckily, however, he has managed to get a place in the past few days. Crucially, I am informed that fewer affordable and social homes are to be completed in Kerry next year. This will add further pressure to the situation. The latest Housing for All progress report verifies what those in the housing services are saying. Of the units completed as a percentage of estimated requirement, Kerry stood at 20% of the 2023 requirement. Commencements in the year ending May 2023 saw a 1% decrease compared with the same period in 2022. With regard to the 2024 requirements, commencements were only at 25% of the estimated requirement. Only 13% of the required total for 2024 had received planning permission by last May, and, year on year, there was even a reduction of 40 in the number of units for which planning permission was received. Clearly, the Government's own plan is not working. We need to give families space to breathe and to sort out the lag in the number of units through capital investment in housing. We need to stop these evictions and stop people becoming homeless.	spk_170

Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-12-06	dail	33	Immigration: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	The immigration, migration and asylum debate, like the system, often seems unclear, unfocused and even chaotic, and often sees more disinformation than almost any other issue in the public policy sphere, on common travel areas, EU travel zones, stamp 4, work visas, international protection and the Ukrainian scheme. It is also worth remembering that 100,000 people arrived in Ireland last year on work visas and they are the people staffing our nursing homes and hospitals. Nation states can and should manage their borders and we do not believe in an open border policy. We believe that all states should manage migration, and this includes having an immigration and asylum system with well-functioning rules and regulations. However, those rules and regulations must be clear and understandable to everyone. In an area like healthcare, for example, many of those working in such roles are migrants themselves. The current stamp system requires more staffing and resourcing to give quicker responses. We need a fair and efficient system, which includes returning failed applicants. It is clear that the asylum system is failing and it is a failure of Government because the Government’s own plan, while not perfect, has not been implemented. There is still a total reliance on the private direct provision market. Providers are cashing in, buying cheaper hotels or guesthouses and sometimes renovating them, sometimes not, but making huge amounts of money with no consideration or consultation with the area in which they have purchased, and no consideration for services to be provided for those making applications for international protection. Why would they, when the Government has made it so easy for them? We then have the inevitable frustration among people in certain areas, including places like Killarney, who feel tired and feel that having taken in thousands, once again their areas are being taken for granted and asked to accommodate more when other areas are not hosting at all. Turning to the motion, we agree that large amounts are spent on private accommodation. As in so many other areas, the Government is using current spending to chase what should be a capital spend. The unsuitability of the accommodation provided, as well as the location of much of it in peripheral places, is exacerbating problems and causing issues with integration that are being exploited by some people. Some issues have turned up in the debate today. It is not correct to say that the Irish who went abroad did not avail of services in other countries. Every single month in my office, sometimes every week, I deal with people who want to return home from England who have benefited from the National Health Service and who have been provided with accommodation by the English state for many years. It is correct that some areas are feeling anxiety but that is because there is a lot of disinformation provided by people who link asylum seekers to criminality, which is irresponsible and unacceptable. While there are undoubtedly pressures due to the large numbers seeking protection and the Russian aggression in Ukraine, it is not acceptable that the Government is not following its own White Paper. The Catherine Day report suggested State-led reception centres around the Twenty-six Counties where applicants would stay while their applications were being processed. A clear phase 1 and phase 2 approach, with reception centres followed by own-door accommodation, is what is required. The White Paper allowed for some ambiguity in how this was to be achieved but the Government has exploited that by mostly focusing on private provision. No progress has been made. There were also IT innovations and other measures recommended in the Catherine Day report but the applications are still taking a long time to process and there are lengthy delays in appeals. In short, we need certainty and we need a system that is clear: clear for the public, clear for applicants and clear in addressing those who have genuine concerns.	spk_37
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-12-05	dail	33	Confidence in the Minister for Justice: Motion	dbsect_11	We have no choice but to bring this motion. We have no choice because the problems are so serious. They have been raised but they were not addressed in an adequate way. We highlighted the problems that existed and continue to exist within criminal justice. We said there was a crisis with Garda morale and the Minister said there was no crisis. We said she needs to complete the new regulations for the Garda Reserve to improve the Garda presence on the street, something demanded by retailers, workers who feel unsafe, shoppers and gardaí, but we are still waiting. The various representatives for justice from Fine Gael who stood here maintained that the target of 1,000 new gardaí this year would be met when it was clear from early summer that the target was unachievable. Maintaining that mantra damaged Government credibility. The number of serving guards has decreased year on year over the past four years. I know and accept that morale in An Garda Síochána is in crisis. Many guards are buying back their pensions in order to leave early. Resignations are at an all-time high. Coming down the tracks is the cohort of gardaí who joined in the mid-1990s when recruitment reopened after the intake of guards had slowed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the medium term we need to recruit, including from the new communities. That is accepted by An Garda Síochána. In the short term, we need to allow Garda management to recruit reservists, which they have not been able to do since 2017. There has been no urgency in helping gardaí to achieve this and the Government has not listened, or if it has, it has not delivered. We could have waited for Fine Gael to make a decision like it did with two of its previous three justice Ministers, but it was not going to do so this time. If we thought it would hasten change, bring more presence on the streets or increase Garda numbers and make people feel safe in their communities - retailers, emergency services, workers and gardaí - then we would, but we do not have confidence that that is going to happen after 13 years of Fine Gael in government. There are fewer gardaí on the streets and fewer Garda stations. In order to solve the problems with morale, the loss of control and resources, the Government and the Minister need to acknowledge the problems. Instead, Government spokespersons have engaged in distraction and delusion. Instead of solid proposals we heard a drum roll of predictably tougher legislation, strangely, the need for clarity on the use of force and, chillingly, the bizarre proposal to cut social welfare, as reported from the parliamentary party meeting, none of which could have prevented the unprecedented crime or the loss of control that happened on 23 November. All of that has convinced me that this Government is incapable of dealing with and solving the problems on our streets. It is incapable of making people safe and the consequences are what we saw last Thursday week. It is clear that the Government is out of touch, has lost credibility on these issues and, crucially, is not listening, and the Minister is not listening. We are saying we have had enough and we will vote no confidence in the Minister for Justice.	spk_214

Tá aithne agam ar an scoil sin mar bhí mo bhean chéile ag múineadh ann ar feadh deich mbliana, agus mo dheartháir chomh maith. I would like to mention those who were directly affected last Thursday in the stabbing incident at Gaelscoil Choláiste Mhuire. They need to be given every assistance for the trauma they suffer. If any school community will show the resilience required to cope with what happened, however, déanfaidh an fhoireann in the Mhuire é sin. We saw a shining example to us of all the bravery of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, and the heroics of numerous people have already been mentioned, such as those who restrained the assailant, protected the children or attempted to give them CPR. That reflects the true spirit of the city and the nation. We hope and pray for a speedy recovery for all those who have been injured. We also must commend the gardaí who showed us, as was noted before, great commitment and courage, especially the resting gardaí who made themselves available to work in spite, as they say themselves, of being under-resourced, underprotected and underappreciated. During the summer, members of An Garda Síochána already made their opinions known about their Commissioner. Over the weekend, they raised further concerns regarding a lack of equipment, a lack of additional training and a lack of organisational support. Last week, the justice committee visited the Garda Training College in Templemore and was very impressed by the level of professionalism and also the way an ethical framework and respect for human rights are woven through all the training programmes.There can be no naivety about the threat to public order and safety. That both fire services and gardaí were attacked a short time afterwards demonstrates the moral vacuum of those who carried out the attack, who had no regard for the children, those who were affected, the workers or their community. The policing failings were clear from the night itself. No doubt, any review of the situation will not be positive for Garda management or the Minister. From soon after the incident, a crowd was gathering, calls were being issued on social media through messaging platforms to gather in town, attempts were being made to encroach on the crime scene, and passers-by from migrant and other backgrounds were being abused. Of course, nobody coming into work here at 9 o'clock on Thursday morning could have predicted it but, by mid-afternoon, anyone with any cop-on would have known there was going to be trouble. Questions will have to be asked as to how things escalated so quickly and why there was not a faster response. The Commissioner claimed that the events could not have been anticipated. Where was the intelligence service in mid-afternoon? What contact took place between the Commissioner, the Minister and anyone else with regard to what was going on? At what time did the Minister speak to him? We need leadership and honesty from the Government and we need credibility. I ask the Minister not to say that there will be 1,000 extra gardaí by the end of the year because that is not going to happen. I ask her not to say that there is not a crisis in morale in An Garda Síochána or that control was not lost, because clearly it was. I ask her not to say that Templemore was closed because we heard last week that it was never closed. Recruitment may have stalled but it was not closed.	spk_146
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-11-28	dail	33	Policing, Protests and Public Order: Statements	dbsect_14	Gardaí, particularly those who received training in Templemore, do not need to be told about their powers under the public order Act but they need to know that the organisation and the Government have their back because they feel that they do not. I ask for the Garda Reserve regulations to be implemented. We heard 20 minutes ago at the Joint Committee on Justice, where we have been calling for this for months, that An Garda Síochána will not be recruiting until at least Easter. I ask the Minister to sit with the representative bodies who have been asking for a meeting for months and to invest more in communities youth services. Fine Gael is in denial about control being lost. It seems that its coalition partners do not agree. Fine Gael has held this Ministry for 13 years, after which time we have a larger population but fewer gardaí. Fianna Fáil's confidence and supply arrangement has enabled Fine Gael for seven years. This coalition does not inspire confidence. The situation with regard to Garda numbers has not been brought under control. The Garda Commissioner called in members from outside of Dublin, but that is another Band-Aid. We heard today that the Government's response is more legislation and more prison spaces. This is not new legislation; it has been spoken about for months. The powers are already there under the public order Act. It is true that the prisons are packed but when rates of recidivism are so high, and nothing is being done to counter them, it is no surprise that numbers are so high. Legislation is already there to allow charges of conspiracy to incite a riot, for example, to be brought. There has been a pattern of a lack of control around the main street of our capital. There have been failures to ensure public safety. People need to feel safe and to feel their children are safe. Emergency workers, retail workers and bus drivers need to be protected. We had hoped that the Government would listen to local businesses, to workers and their families, and to parents of children. It should also listen to the demands for greater Garda presence on the streets. However, it is clear that it is still not listening. It has reverted back to Fine Gael type, which is law and order and more legislation, which will not work. It needs to listen to communities, get to grips with the situation so that people can feel safe and protected, and ensure there is a proper response. Does anyone have confidence that the Government can rectify these problems? I do not believe so. Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and Fine Gael must reflect carefully rather than seeing the situation continue to degrade.	spk_148
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-11-21	dail	33	Health Service Recruitment Freeze: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_15	It is interesting to note that the Government's line in response to this motion is that there is no recruitment freeze or embargo. According to the amendment to the Sinn Féin motion, recruitment is continuing for graduate nurses and doctors in training and that exemptions also apply in disability and a list of specified front-line and residential posts. However, senior people in University Hospital Kerry tell me they cannot recruit junior hospital doctors in non-training posts. They have sought clarification from the Department and are none the wiser because they have not received a reply. Despite the freeze being extended again - I note the HSE refuses to rule out further extensions - it now covers such a broad variety of positions that the effects are beginning to be seen in the hospital. Other people tell me that physiotherapy and occupational therapy services were already struggling and now are falling badly behind. For many who need physical rehabilitation this will likely mean irreversible damage or that they cannot be rehabilitated to an independent lifestyle. University Hospital Kerry was already short of 50 administrators before this freeze.The scheduling of follow-up appointments is becoming increasingly difficult and waiting lists are lengthening across the board. Perhaps most worryingly of all, results from lab tests are not being processed and returned to GPs in a timely manner and there is no administration staff to follow up on tests of concern. Surgery, orthopaedics and rheumatology are also affected, according to people who I spoke to. Winter and the flu season is coming and there also have been some Covid outbreaks. The impact of the flu is already being seen in paediatrics and management positions cannot be filled until the regional health areas, RHAs, are commenced in the new year. Outside of hospital settings, things do not look much better. The Government's stance is that the disability sector remains unaffected or it is exploiting the fact that some care roles inevitably have a higher turnover, meaning recruitment must continue, to claim that there is no embargo. I spoke to one worker in the sector, who told me that a contract offered was rescinded. Another healthcare worker was verbally offered a role, which was also rescinded. Investments that should have been made years ago and should have been enforced were left on the shelf and it is the sick and most vulnerable who will suffer.	spk_176

While the family has received good contact from Finglas Garda station, they are frustrated at the seeming lack of progress in the investigation.

Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-11-08	dail	33	Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence Agency Bill 2023: Report and Final Stages	dbsect_13	On Committee Stage, we moved an amendment to section 41 after concerns were raised with us regarding the safeguarding of personal data of victims and survivors in the context of any information request made by the agency to a service provider under that section. In fairness to the Minister, she said she would check out the point. She contacted us to say she had received advice from the Attorney General which stated the proposed amendment was unecessary as it was not intended the agency would process such data and section 41 did not provide a basis for it to do so. She stated she was satisfied, in the context of section 41 or any other provision, that had it been intended for the Bill to provide such a basis, it would have to have been explicitly provided for in the Bill. Stating in clear and accessible language that victims' personal data will be protected may encourage victims to seek out support services. Some of the NGOs involved, however, made the point that if the amendment is fully in line with the intention to protect such data, how can it affect the Department to include it in the Bill? Why not include it if it is not going to make any difference anyway? The benefit of the protection felt by victims or the feeling they would have that their data are being protected would outweigh any potential administrative inconvenience involved in making the changes. That is the feeling that came back from them and I wanted to put it to the Minister before we proceeded further.	spk_265

Credit is due to the Minister and her team for the work that they are putting into it. It is not really something to be scoring political points on. I credit them all for the work they are doing and the support that will follow when we can see that there is good progressive legislation going through, notwithstanding some of the concerns that have been expressed. It is our duty to put them to the Minister. When we have brought up particular points, she has responded in kind. We will support her on that.	spk_270
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-10-25	dail	33	European Parliament Directive on Victims of Crime: Motion (Resumed)	dbsect_21	"Justice policy is an area where there is increasing harmonisation across member states. Ireland is one of only two common law jurisdictions in the EU, the other being Cyprus. As such, we need to examine proposals in depth given the unique application of the law in this State. While scrutiny of EU legislation is the remit of the justice committee, this debate is important. Before turning to the new proposals, it is worth outlining what the existing directive does. It establishes minimum standards on the rights of, supports for and protection of victims of crime. It aims to ensure victims of crime receive appropriate information, support and protection so that they are able to participate in criminal proceedings and that their voices are heard. The directive requires that each country in the European Union shall ensure victims are recognised and treated in a respectful, sensitive, tailored, professional and non-discriminatory manner in all contacts with victim support, restorative justice services or the competent authority operating in the context of criminal proceedings. It should be noted that the directive does have some bite because some countries, such as the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary and Italy among others, have had action taken against them for failing to completely transpose the directive into national law. In this State the directive was transposed by the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act. As the  Victims need to have fear of the system removed. They need reassurance they will be supported and that they are intrinsic to the system rather than on the periphery. I frequently hear that victims believe it is a waste of time. They need assurance that they are not alone and that everything will be done, while guaranteeing the right to a fair trial at the same time. They need assurance that they will receive the justice they deserve. Victims should know they will be treated with dignity, respect, care and understanding and perpetrators should know their crime will be investigated and prosecuted. There is also wider work to be done in reducing the number of sexual crimes, through public education campaigns on consent and victims' rights. This involves the HSE, An Garda Síochána and others, including central government. A review was conducted by Tom O'Malley on the protection of vulnerable witnesses in the investigation and prosecution of these types of offences. I am also conscious of the need to provide a clear definition of what constitutes a victim. Presupposing a crime and a victim of that crime prior to a court making any finding has the potential to prejudice justice, certainly when considered in the round and definitely when applied to specific cases. That being said, An Garda Síochána, in meeting the requirements of the directive, uses the following definition, which seems sensible. It defines a victim as a natural person who has suffered harm, including physical, mental or emotional harm or an economic loss caused by a criminal offence. There are also family members of a person whose death was directly caused by a criminal offence and who have suffered harm as a result of that person's death. In recent times the House has heard, and no doubt will hear again, from people who have a deceased member of their family who feel, sometimes decades later, that justice has not been done. The directive contains a lot of detail about restorative justice services, which it defines as including, for example, victim offender mediation, family group conferencing and sentencing circles. The directive acknowledges, as does Sinn Féin, that such services require safeguards to prevent secondary and repeat victimisation intimidation and retaliation. We in Sinn Féin plan to move legislation related to restorative justice soon. At present, restorative justice is used in limited and inconsistent circumstances. We have what we hope to be good proposals on dealing with restorative justice, from the commencement of a complaint until sentencing. The Irish Penal Reform Trust recently called for increased use of community-based alternatives to prison, a reversal of plans to increase prison spaces, and amendments to existing legislation to ensure imprisonment is a sanction of last resort. When we have met prison governors they have consistently told us that short sentences are of very limited use to anybody, including victims of crime and the person who is being sentenced. The call to ensure imprisonment is a sanction of last resort was in response to the latest Irish Prison Service annual report and the Probation Service annual report for last year. The Irish Prison Service annual report shows a significant increase in people committed to prison in Ireland in 2022. There was a particular increase in the number of women committed and in the number of committals and sentences of less than 12 months. It is a topic that needs to be explored and the directive offers a way through which Sinn Féin hopes to realise our proposals on restorative justice. The criminal injuries compensation scheme was mentioned by the Minister of State in his opening statement. I note the review was launched by the Minister in 2021. We hope there will be some progress in this. I remember when I started as an apprentice solicitor, the first case I did on my own was before the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal, which was still dealing with the 1986 rules. Extending the timeframe is important and updating the limits is also important to give victims the justice they seek. With regard to the changes, according to the briefing document we have received, the main objectives are to provide a significant improvement in access to information, alignment of protection measures for vulnerable people, improved access to specialist support and more effective participation in criminal proceedings for victims. It also aims to facilitate access to compensation in all cases, including, as I have said, national cross-border cases and with regard to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal. The most significant changes are the establishment of a helpline with an EU-wide telephone number and setting up a comprehensive website that should also allow for chats and emails. Provided this is standardised throughout the EU it has great potential. Perhaps it is to work in a similar way to airline compensation or other consumer-facing initiatives. The measures on the standardisation of protection measures, for example, protection orders or ensuring the presence of law enforcement authorities, are to apply from when the complainant first makes contact with the police. Criminal gangs are becoming increasingly sophisticated and transnational and this element is important. Providing access to specialised support services for vulnerable victims, such as free psychological support for as long as necessary depending on the victim's individual needs, is important. Wider psychological supports are under threat due to poor Government management of the health service. Victims of crime are vulnerable themselves and it is important, to prevent crime recurring and recidivism, to increase psychological services and counselling services in prisons. Having two Merchants Quay-appointed counsellors for 500 or 600 prisoners in Midlands Prison will not achieve much.Victims of crime, of course, are vulnerable people themselves, and groups such as the elderly, disabled and people of protected characteristics are frequently victims of crime. Protecting them is important, but resources need to be put in place to ensure this takes place. From the note, I understand there are some challenges to be overcome. There is a serious problem now with accessing legal representation in a District Court, especially in family law cases. People are on waiting lists for months sometimes, and the challenges surrounding the provision of speedy legal advice to vulnerable people need to be addressed. People in refuges and those victims of domestic violence whom we have met have confirmed this.  We also noted on the news this morning the mention of the pervasive and relentless rise of racism in the EU. It was described by Michael O'Flaherty, a director at the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, as shameful. Racism and discrimination have no place in our society. In this State, 39% of people described as ""black"" in news reports have indicated that someone made offensive or threatening comments to their child because of their ethnic or immigrant background. Some 55% of people of African descent here have reported racial discrimination over the last five years. This is up from 46% in 2016. Some 64% of people of African heritage worry about being the victim of a racial attack, which is far higher than the EU average of 35%. Irish people know what it is like to have experienced racism in recent years. Even phrases used by Irish people can be included in this context. I remember hearing gardaí using the phrases ""the Paddy wagon"" or ""that is a bit Irish"". They have racial bias too. The abuse that James McClean has experienced at this time of year for the last several years also had some racial undertones. This is unacceptable, and I look forward to hearing and seeing what the outcome of the proposed changes will be and then seeing these transposed into Irish law. "	spk_191
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-10-24	dail	33	Health Service Funding: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_13	I support this motion. I condemn the Government, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the leader of the Green Party for their reckless decision to underfund the health service in budget 2024. I have listened to what the Minister has said and it all sounds great. All the while, a new community hospital is opening up in Killarney that will not provide one extra bed because the other beds are being closed. I have heard what the Minister said in respect of GPs entering practice but how many of them are going to be working full time? In rural Ireland it is very difficult to get a locum never mind a GP. Where is the minor injuries clinic that is so needed in County Kerry? I support the call for the Government to increase the funding allocation for the Department of Health, particularly as existing levels of service are diminishing by the day. As of today University Hospital Kerry, UHK, has 23 people waiting on trolleys, which is on a par with much larger hospitals in the cities. According to the National Treatment Purchase Fund and as reported by Radio Kerry, some 11,000 people are on waiting lists in the county. There are currently 50 whole-time equivalent clerical vacancies in a hospital which has been traditionally under-resourced. This will directly impact on patient care. There is no rheumatology secretary. There is a similar lack of staff in cardiology. New referrals are going to have to be sent to Cork. Respiratory pulmonary function tests will also not be able to take place in UHK. Serious problems will arise. It is time to deal with this now, lift the embargo and introduce a supplementary budget as soon as possible.	spk_164
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-10-18	dail	33	Middle East and the Occupied Palestinian Territories: Statements (Resumed)	dbsect_21	"Sinn Féin's amendment highlights Israel's brutal assault on the civilian population of Gaza, which has resulted in the deaths of over 1,000 children. It also highlights the forced displacement of Palestinians, the cutting off of water, fuel, food and medical supplies, and the destruction of civilian infrastructure. The unjustifiable acts of Hamas occurred against the intensification of the Israeli occupation in Palestine since 2022. From the beginning of this year, 700 people had been killed by Israel. Israel's collective punishment is a war crime and an expansion of the blockade it has enforced on Gaza since 2007. We need a decisive international intervention. This is the request of this House; it is not in fact a request but our demand. We have heard time and again from apologists, including from some former Ministers and world leaders who know international law and should know better, who envelop themselves in equivocation or ""standing with Israel"", which translates as ""Israel, you may commit acts of state terror, you may kill thousands of children and we will look the other way."" In this country we know all about that. The families of Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson know what happens when governments look the other way. Irish people identify with Palestinians and we see the parallels. My town is twinned with a Palestinian town, Beit Sahour, on the West Bank. We hear that Israel needs to defend itself. What does that mean? I do not propose to address the ramblings of Deputy Phelan, except to say I noted that he walked out in the middle of Deputy Flaherty's excellent speech. On what he said about self-defence, he should have a look at the proportionality element of it and have a close look at what self-defence means. The history of Israel's self-defence has been to kill three times as many Palestinians. Revenge is not self-defence, bombing UN-sponsored schools and hospitals is not self-defence and cutting off water, sanitation and electricity is not self-defence. A just peace requires an end to the illegal occupation and apartheid systems. Just like Ursula von der Leyen promised ""iron-clad solidarity"" to support peace in Ireland, so too should there be iron-clad solidarity with the people of Palestine. Similarly, I hope the President of the United States will not sit back and allow a situation to develop where, as he said, a small country which ""endured discrimination and were denied opportunity"" is plunged into famine while world leaders look away. We need, in the interim, to show international leadership by recognising the state of Palestine. I will finish with a quote from Sinéad O'Connor:How many mothers to cry?How many sons have to die?How many missions left to fly over Palestine?Cause as a matter of factsIt's a pact, it's an act These are illegal attacks So bring the soldiers back"	spk_239
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-10-17	dail	33	Final Report of the Independent Scoping Exercise into the Circumstances surrounding the Death of Mr. Shane O'Farrell: Statements	dbsect_25	I compliment the O'Farrell family for their dignity and determination to find the truth about what happened to Shane and the lead up to those events. Having met Lucia, Hannah, Gemma and the rest of the family a number of times, I know the depth of their knowledge and insight is matched only by their commitment to their quest for justice. Last week, we attended a cross-party briefing facilitated by Deputy Carthy. Taken alone, many of the issues raised at that meeting pertaining to this case may not have been enough to call for an inquiry but taken together, the whole issue needs an inquiry to address the various issues properly. The perfect storm that led to the death of Shane could happen again. That is not good enough. We have the issue of the Courts Service error, which meant that Mr. Gridziuska did not serve one of the sentences for which he was convicted and there were clearly failings that meant the appeal was not heard. In fact, he received two prison sentences which he never served. There were also failings in respect of the conduct of the Garda and questions about its relationship with Mr. Gridziuska. I heard the Minister say that the Garda co-operated with the scoping exercise but questions over that relationship have not been answered properly. Why did gardaí stop Mr. Gridziuska an hour before Shane died? Why did they not act on the command made to the State by Judge O'Hagan that if Mr. Gridziuska were to get into any more trouble, he was to be brought back before him immediately? Why did all of that not happen? An inquiry is the only place those questions can be answered. An inquiry should also look into the circumstances and events surrounding his death, given the many issues involved. The functioning of the bail system must, of course, be a particular focus. I do not believe that the scoping report satisfactorily covered that matter. I am not calling for new legislation in respect of bail but it is clear that when someone like Judge O'Hagan specifically asks for a defendant to be brought before him if there were to be reoffending, and there was a lot of reoffending in this case, there is something wrong with the system. Mr. Gridziuska was on bail from various courts, including Ardee, Carrickmacross, Monaghan and Newry. No one seemed to be in control of the procedures and managing them in the proper way. That should be looked into by any inquiry in order to prevent it happening to another family. The raft of reoffending and the lack of oversight tally with what Lucia says. There are clear problems with the granting of bail and its revocation and they need to be addressed. I agree 100% with that. We are currently living in a worrying time with regard to road traffic offences, given what has happened over recent weeks and months. The number of deaths and injuries has been increasing. There has been commentary on the lack of consequences for people who have offended. It is hard to go back to those people and tell them they are wrong when there do not seem to have been adequate consequences, particularly in this case. There are other issues with section 101 of the Garda Síochána Act that do not allow a family to have access to the investigation. Perhaps that issue could be looked at. Statements to the coroner are another issue. Ultimately, I support the O'Farrell family. I feel the scoping exercise has investigated but has not provided all the answers to the family. We hope no other family will have to go through such an experience.	spk_212

Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-10-11	dail	33	Community Development Projects	dbsect_2	During the summer, when we met with some senior gardaí and there was a big issue with presence of gardaí, not only on the streets of Dublin but around the country, one of the issues the senior gardaí brought up was the absence of these regulations. It is good to hear they will meet this week, but I ask the Minister to push ahead with the regulations as quickly as she possibly can to get more people on the streets. As she said, communities need to feel safe. I have noticed that, with larger events, the public order side of things is definitely improved when people see a large Garda presence on the streets. I agree with the Minister that recruitment is a way to reach out into newer communities. When ordinary gardaí, most importantly, are recruited, more effort should be made to reach into those new communities. It is also an opportunity to reach out to the new communities to get them into the mainstream organisation.	spk_3
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-10-11	dail	33	Community Development Projects	dbsect_2	I have just one question. How come this took so long? This issue was being flagged much earlier in the year. The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland said the Garda Reserve is a cost-effective way to provide surge capacity for policing special events and can provide policing experience for those who may be interested in joining the force but may be undecided or wary about it. In new communities, particularly those from eastern Europe, maybe, there is a suspicion and a fear - they do not have the same relationship with the police force that maybe we have in Ireland - but this can also be a breaking ground to allow those people in. Because of the resignations we see in the organisation, we must be careful that reservists do not replace fully trained gardaí - the Garda is a professional force, and gardaí are very well trained - and that they can work together in a sort of symbiosis. I urge the Minister to get this in as soon as possible.	spk_5
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-10-11	dail	33	Community Development Projects	dbsect_2	This question gets down to police presence on the streets. Gardaí tell me that a lot of their time is taken up, apart from paperwork and inputting, doing non-police work. Five years ago, the Commission for the Future of Policing in Ireland suggested a lot of reform in non-core duties and taking gardaí of all levels away from non-core duties. What steps are being taken to implement that report?	spk_13
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-10-11	dail	33	Community Development Projects	dbsect_2	I have a few points in relation to what the Minister said. I acknowledge the large amount in the budget and that the training allowance will be increased, which we called for. I also acknowledge that many civilian staff have been hired but the Department previously stated that, for every one civilian staff member hired, one garda could be deployed back to front-line duties. That has not happened. I know there has been some movement in relation to immigration but there is much more that can be done and there are many more recommendations in the Commission for the Future of Policing in Ireland report.Sinn Féin made a submission before the report was published which stated that, to the greatest extent possible, all duties which do not require a garda with full police training should be allocated to an appropriately trained civilian. That was reflected in the report, which contains a chapter on non-core duties. Some of the other things, apart from immigration, which were mentioned were security at courts, transporting remand prisoners, serving summonses, prosecutions, presenting in District Courts, attending minor road traffic accidents, attending the coroner's court and safeguarding examination papers. They are a lot of the changes that could get more gardaí back onto the streets and make people in communities feel safer.	spk_15
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-10-11	dail	33	Community Development Projects	dbsect_2	The report, which is five years old, was quite unequivocal and stated the absolute priority should be that front-line district police should have the resources to perform their core community safety duties. That was a constant theme in the report. The urgency of the situation has not been addressed. I acknowledge what the Minister has said, but when will the court presenting changes be implemented? Will there be extra staff in State solicitors' offices to perform these duties? When will gardaí be taken from juries? There are a lot of other ongoing duties currently undertaken by gardaí, and it is fair to say that reforms have been very slow since the report was published five years ago. This is all the more urgent given the crisis of morale in An Garda Síochána. The sense of job satisfaction has plummeted. Gardaí feel very stretched. Anything that can be done to implement the reforms that are gathering dust and get more police back on the street needs to be done urgently at this stage.	spk_17

Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-10-11	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_3	During the summer, when we met with some senior gardaí and there was a big issue with presence of gardaí, not only on the streets of Dublin but around the country, one of the issues the senior gardaí brought up was the absence of these regulations. It is good to hear they will meet this week, but I ask the Minister to push ahead with the regulations as quickly as she possibly can to get more people on the streets. As she said, communities need to feel safe. I have noticed that, with larger events, the public order side of things is definitely improved when people see a large Garda presence on the streets. I agree with the Minister that recruitment is a way to reach out into newer communities. When ordinary gardaí, most importantly, are recruited, more effort should be made to reach into those new communities. It is also an opportunity to reach out to the new communities to get them into the mainstream organisation.	spk_3
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-10-11	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_3	I have just one question. How come this took so long? This issue was being flagged much earlier in the year. The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland said the Garda Reserve is a cost-effective way to provide surge capacity for policing special events and can provide policing experience for those who may be interested in joining the force but may be undecided or wary about it. In new communities, particularly those from eastern Europe, maybe, there is a suspicion and a fear - they do not have the same relationship with the police force that maybe we have in Ireland - but this can also be a breaking ground to allow those people in. Because of the resignations we see in the organisation, we must be careful that reservists do not replace fully trained gardaí - the Garda is a professional force, and gardaí are very well trained - and that they can work together in a sort of symbiosis. I urge the Minister to get this in as soon as possible.	spk_5
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-10-11	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_5	This question gets down to police presence on the streets. Gardaí tell me that a lot of their time is taken up, apart from paperwork and inputting, doing non-police work. Five years ago, the Commission for the Future of Policing in Ireland suggested a lot of reform in non-core duties and taking gardaí of all levels away from non-core duties. What steps are being taken to implement that report?	spk_13
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-10-11	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_5	I have a few points in relation to what the Minister said. I acknowledge the large amount in the budget and that the training allowance will be increased, which we called for. I also acknowledge that many civilian staff have been hired but the Department previously stated that, for every one civilian staff member hired, one garda could be deployed back to front-line duties. That has not happened. I know there has been some movement in relation to immigration but there is much more that can be done and there are many more recommendations in the Commission for the Future of Policing in Ireland report.Sinn Féin made a submission before the report was published which stated that, to the greatest extent possible, all duties which do not require a garda with full police training should be allocated to an appropriately trained civilian. That was reflected in the report, which contains a chapter on non-core duties. Some of the other things, apart from immigration, which were mentioned were security at courts, transporting remand prisoners, serving summonses, prosecutions, presenting in District Courts, attending minor road traffic accidents, attending the coroner's court and safeguarding examination papers. They are a lot of the changes that could get more gardaí back onto the streets and make people in communities feel safer.	spk_15
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-10-11	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_5	The report, which is five years old, was quite unequivocal and stated the absolute priority should be that front-line district police should have the resources to perform their core community safety duties. That was a constant theme in the report. The urgency of the situation has not been addressed. I acknowledge what the Minister has said, but when will the court presenting changes be implemented? Will there be extra staff in State solicitors' offices to perform these duties? When will gardaí be taken from juries? There are a lot of other ongoing duties currently undertaken by gardaí, and it is fair to say that reforms have been very slow since the report was published five years ago. This is all the more urgent given the crisis of morale in An Garda Síochána. The sense of job satisfaction has plummeted. Gardaí feel very stretched.

Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-10-11	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 4: General (Resumed)	dbsect_18	The first issue I want to mention before I go into other issues is the recruitment ban that is currently in place in University Hospital Kerry for clerical and administrative staff. There are currently 50 whole-time equivalent, WTE, vacancies in that hospital in an area that has been traditionally under-resourced for years and where the administrative staff are underpinning every service within the hospital. The duties of these clerical staff include plans of care, communicating with GPs, retrieving medical health records, making appointments and supporting consultants. Imagine if there was a shortage of 50 staff or there was an announcement of 50 jobs coming to the town. There would be no shortage of Ministers willing to take credit for it. The embargo that is in place is going to cause severe problems. I know of people who are acting up at higher grades who are not being compensated or paid for doing so.The efforts that are being made to reduce the endocrinology waiting lists and deal with cardiology are going to be affected by the lack of staff and by this embargo. I am asking the Minister to tell her colleagues to do something about it. We cannot wait until the new RHAs are appointed in 2024 before something is done about it. On the justice side of the budget, we are playing catch-up. The Government's measures are unlikely to forestall a crisis in many areas of the justice system. Recently I received a communication from a member of An Garda Síochána in Dublin. He told me there was nobody available to take the Áras overtime in one particular station, or the Cabra overtime, so regular gardaí from Blanchardstown and Finglas had to be sent in there. Blanchardstown was then down to a minimum of one car, in an area with a population the size of Limerick. Cabra had no car, apparently, and one person left in the station. Finglas was also down to the minimum. That is the level of crisis that was going to be there when the industrial action was taken. Thankfully, there has been some progress in relation to that but we are at crisis point if these negotiations do not work out. Sinn Féin has proposed a doubling of the training allowance to try to increase the number of attestations. Every lever must be pulled in this area due to the historic issues with recruitment and retention over the last number of years. There is no harm in reiterating what numbers have been. In 2021, there were 14,200 gardaí. In 2022, there were 14,211 and in 2023 it was down to 13,900. Combined with these stagnant numbers, we now see an increase in resignations from the baseline. There were 312 departures in 2018 but 405 in 2021, 476 in 2022 and 227 up to the end of May of this year. There is of course a crisis in morale in An Garda Síochána. Only 24 had attested this year up to a few months ago, while 116 started their training in 2022. Obviously if you do the maths, there is a huge gap if we are to return to the more than 600 attestations per year. We discussed this earlier and I know the Minister is aware of the issues relating to garda presence, the Garda Reserve and full implementation of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. As I said, the roster dispute is looking more promising than it did a number of weeks ago but this agreement will not forestall further departures. The budget is unlikely to do the same either. I would be interested to see how much of the budget allocated in this area is a carryover from the last three years. There is obviously an increase in overtime with the roster that is currently in place but in many Garda divisions across the country, finding enough gardaí to actually do the overtime is the challenge. I have given one example. I have heard other stories of close to 100 days in annual leave accumulated. One can only stretch people so far before they break. New recruits are important but we are losing well-trained and experienced officers. Few gardaí are staying a day beyond their finishing date and many that I know are buying back their time to get out as early as possible.  Outside the justice portfolio and recruitment and retention, we have also received many emails from rank-and-file gardaí. They also mentioned the lack of affordable housing and having to face the prospect of emigration. Gardaí feel they are lacking support and are overburdened with paperwork and inputting. The Taoiseach seemed to be in the mood to shoot the messenger when emigration was raised with him but it is a fact that many public service professionals are leaving the country; not only gardaí but teachers and nurses are priced out of owning homes. While this is not the Minister for Justice's direct responsibility, the policies of the Government over the last 12 years are not working. The extra provision within prisons mostly deals with increased prisoner numbers and some ICT upgrades. I would hope the Government could be more progressive in dealing with trying to reduce incarceration rates. We will shortly be introducing a Bill that will try to deal with this and have restorative justice. We will support the Government if it wants to take some of our ideas on board. With regard to the youth justice programme, while an increase of 10% is welcome, we had proposed 20% in order to deal with the crisis with young people. Going back to the Garda issue, 136 Garda stations were closed from 2012 on and the saving has been a mere €3.2 million. Imagine if we had those Garda stations now - we might not be dealing with the problems we are dealing with. At the time, the public were promised that this would allow for rank-and-file gardaí to be redeployed to front-line duties and, of course, that never happened.	spk_197

Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-10-04	dail	33	An Garda Síochána: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a thabhairt don Ghrúpa Réigiúnach. I thank the Minister for taking the questions. This is a timely motion. Sinn Féin representatives have raised matter in here repeatedly over the last year. I welcome the Minster's commitment to community policing and her comments on that. The community gardaí cannot be underestimated. The work they do in giving a sense of security in the community, particularly for older people when they see them around, is very important. Sometimes I think they are not appreciated even within the Garda. The community gardaí are the first people to be cut in communities when there is a shortage. I have had people in Killarney telling me there was a meeting organised and the garda was not available because the post had been removed. I welcome the Minister's commitment to that. I also want to compliment the Minister on the work she has done in respect of domestic violence over the past year or two. We were in the committee yesterday and the progress that has been made over the last two years is well done. On the motion, one note of caution I would sound relates to the wording around an increase in crime. While there have been large increases in figures between quarter 2 of last year and the same period this year, they really show more consistency with pre-Covid numbers from 2019. The robberies, extortions, thefts and homicides are indeed up year on year but these offences are aligning closer to pre-pandemic levels. They are coming back to where they were. This comes against the background of increasingly difficult conditions for the Garda and long waits for court cases. There have been difficulties over the past three years. There is a huge increase in the number of prisoners in custody on remand for over one year. I think it has gone from about 4% to 12%. There are delays in the courts. The law term commenced yesterday. Maybe we should be making some progress on bringing the law term back to mid-September so that the backlog can be cleared.  One other note of caution in respect of the motion, while we are broadly supportive of it, is in respect of mandatory custodial sentences. The sentences are there already. I am not a great believer in mandatory sentences across the board. Some of them are unconstitutional, clearly. While it is easy to say, it is much more difficult to implement. Recruitment and retention of gardaí must be prioritised. We are awaiting the publication of the Garda Reserve regulations. We raised this during a recent meeting with Garda management and were advised that they are due very soon. We were told it would be in quarter 4 and we are just into quarter 4 now. The Minister said herself that it would be soon. All over the country but particularly in Dublin, people are waiting. The demand from Kerry to Louth to Donegal is to have more presence on the streets. It is very important that these regulations are published as soon as possible in order that the Garda can go and recruit reserves to keep the presence on the street that is demanded in the communities. On the withdrawal of voluntary overtime, I have heard some alarming stories from front-line gardaí. I do not want to go into too many details but the practice of having to move various rank-and-file gardaí around who are already in place, due to the shortages, has left some gaps. They must be plugged as soon as possible. It must be borne in mind that voluntary overtime was papering over previous cracks. Gardaí withdrawing their support for this is merely a preview of what may result if the crisis is not resolved. One sergeant told a colleague of mine after increases to overtime to combat the issues we saw in Dublin city centre over the summer that overtime funding is not the problem, it is finding people to do it. Many units from the periphery of Dublin city centre are already at half the numbers they had pre-Covid. Taking them into the city centre is just causing stress and strain. The current dispute over rostering is a consequence of the decline in numbers. The stress and strain placed on members has no doubt contributed to diminishing morale within An Garda Síochána. That level of frustration has led to the extraordinary motion which was put by the Garda Representative Association recently. Important reforms and improvements are difficult to implement in this context and recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, such as moving gardaí away from non-core duties, coroners' courts, court presenting and prisoner escorts, must be placed back on track as soon as possible. It is worth going through a few figures on Garda recruitment. The strength has declined and the three years could lead to a dip. I will pass over to my colleague because she is getting anxious.	spk_33
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-10-04	dail	33	Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Human Trafficking) Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_15	"This is an important Bill with a number of long overdue reforms. I want to mention the hard work of a number of campaigners, including the Women of Honour. I note the Defence Forces section of the Bills digest includes reference to the independent review group on dignity and equality issues in Defence Forces. The Bill contains amendments to sections 169 and 192 of the 1954 Act. I pay tribute to the Women of Honour for pushing their case in order that we have better justice. Their campaign will continue, no doubt. We have also seen many others in the courts bravely waiving their right to anonymity in sexual offences cases to encourage other women to come forward about abuse. No doubt some of the recommendations have come as a result of their bravery. These are difficult cases. The adversarial nature of the legal system, which is there to uphold the rights of defendants and victims alike, can sometimes lead to contradictions and challenges. I was struck by the words of one woman in a recent victim impact statement, as reported in  Coming forward and making a report, often relating to historic abuse going back decades, is one part of upholding the rights of victims. An investigation in 2020 revealed that with regard to a range of institutions, including the Garda, social services, the legal system, youth services, the political system and mental health services, survivors feel let down. Access to therapeutic supports for adults and children continues to be an issue. While this is not under the remit of the Minister of State, I am sure he acknowledges their importance. In our recent debate on the Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence Agency Bill we highlighted the importance of a whole-of-government approach to these issues, which must be reiterated. In 2022 it was revealed that 41% of requests to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, for explanations where there was no prosecution related to sexual offences. This was followed by a recent review by the National Women's Council of Ireland and the Department of Justice. Complainants often want answers. They want to be trusted. We must look at policy solutions that can assist in this. Restorative justice is something on which we will launch a Bill soon. We will be tabling legislation. This could assist greatly. According to the EU forum for restorative justice, victim satisfaction is at least 85%. This is obviously very high. With many cases difficult to prosecute increasing its usage may give victims and those accused more satisfactory outcomes. I will say more on this later. I have one or two comments on the Minister of State's speech. I note what he said on the Supreme Court judgment at the end of August. He described it as a complex and nuanced judgment on criminal liability. Consideration must be given to what the Minister of State has said. We look forward to discussing this further on Committee Stage and seeing the Minister of State's proposals arising out of the Supreme Court case. We welcome sexual assault victims being entitled to legal representation. The Minister of State said that the scope of the provision is being expanded and it will not only be with regard to previous sexual history. Legal representatives will be present in court and will be able to advise the victim to object to any obtrusive question. We welcome this. I note that the Bill refers to a verdict being announced but the Minister of State stated that verdicts will be delivered. I thought what the Minister of State said about excluding nosy neighbours or complete strangers from the courtroom to be curious. This is something that can be considered on Committee Stage. There will be a conflict between justice being seen to be done and the other side of the argument, which is removing what the Minister of State described as nosy neighbours. I am not sure there has been great difficulty with announcing the verdict in court but we can discuss this again on Committee Stage. Anonymity for victims and accused in sexual assault trials is important. It is possible for a number of offences already. I note the O'Malley review stated admitting the public could easily lead to identification. Let us examine on Committee Stage whether there has been a difficulty in practice rather than speculating as to whether it is taking place. I certainly never saw too many nosy neighbours around the courtrooms. The O'Malley review stated that consultees were agreed that criminal proceedings for sexual offences should take place otherwise than in public and it was dissatisfied with the current arrangements, which do not amount to secret justice. He stated that bona fide representatives of the press are always entitled to be present to report on proceedings while respecting the anonymity of the victim and the accused, except of course where an application is made with regard to sexual experience. The review also discussed the stress that could be placed on complainants and victims by the presence of the media and the risk of anonymity being compromised. There is a balance there.We do not want to move to a scenario, which some people have warned against, where a verdict might be delivered and not openly declared in court by a jury. Would people be able to tell whether it was unanimous or a majority? It is important that it would be announced in open court. As I said, the Bill extends the right to separate legal representation and this is to be welcomed. It would be remiss of me not to mention the barristers who yesterday took action over cuts in the rates of their fees. This matter has been ongoing for some time. The buck has been passed between the Department of Justice and Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform. The latter Department cannot be blamed for everything. While this measure is welcome, it is important that a barrister would be found in these types of cases. The viability of criminal defence and criminal prosecution, and a career at the Bar as a whole, is under immense threat. I note that according to one study, as many as two thirds of newly-qualified barristers leave the profession within six years. We support any fee restoration and link back to the position of assistant principal. The link between the payment and the assistant principal position was unilaterally taken away after the crash. Has a regulatory impact assessment been carried out with regard to this provision? What is the estimated demand for barristers that will arise as a result of more of them being brought into court to represent the views and interests of victims in criminal cases? One other element of the Bill is, ""Amending the mens rea or mental element of rape to provide that the offence is committed where there is non-consensual intercourse and the ... [person] 'does not reasonably believe' at the time of the intercourse that the woman consents."" The need for education on this subject is very clear. I note that in every third-level institution now, consent classes are undertaken. Great strides are being made with regard to consent but the implications of this definition, which may become clear once a case has been prosecuted, does need to be teased out. That may be another point to discuss on Committee Stage. The Bill puts the national referral mechanism for human trafficking on a statutory footing. We have long supported anti-human trafficking measures. We saw criticism of the State recently from bodies such as the Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, GRETA, which have pointed out the lack of a compensation mechanism for victims as well as a lack of national referral mechanism. It is very complicated, but it is one area in which we must continue to make strides as well as acknowledge the wider socioeconomic pressures that lead people to fall victim to trafficking. Good migration policy will mitigate this. I am sure we are all united with regard to the protection of children, and the ratification of the provision of the second operational protocol on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child has been long delayed."	spk_189
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-09-28	dail	33	Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence Agency Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_35	"Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire Stáit. This Bill is very welcome and we will support it moving to the next stage. The need for a stand-alone agency has been very clear for some time. The epidemic of domestic violence, which was particularly seen during the Covid pandemic, has pushed forward the need to implement the third national strategy. There must be a zero-tolerance approach, as the Minister of State has said, and it is important that there be co-design and consolidation of all of the various funding agencies. I agree with what the Minister of State said in his speech in that I also have no doubt that every Member of this House appreciates the need for the State to step up and co-ordinate the response to DSGBV. It is worth setting out the context of the Bill. The State ratified the Istanbul Convention in March 2019 and it entered into force in July of that year. That convention created a legal framework at pan-European level to protect women against all forms of violence. It aims to prevent, prosecute and eliminate violence against women and domestic violence. The Group of Experts on Action against Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, GREVIO, is the independent expert body responsible for monitoring the implementation of the convention. It published a report, drafted by the Government, in July of last year. This report largely covers what the Government is doing or has committed to do in the space of DSGBV. There was also a shadow report submitted by the National Observatory on Violence Against Women and Girls later in 2022. This report is worth looking at in some detail because it gives a good assessment of the current state of affairs and where the agency and Government policy will need to progress to if the State's Istanbul obligations are to be fulfilled. Broadly speaking, there are four areas that are relevant to the Bill addressed in the report. The first and most important is refuge accommodation. Over the past number of months, I have spoken with a number of agencies on the ground, including the Tullamore domestic violence agency and Adapt in Tralee. There are very significant problems. Some are related to the current housing crisis. I note that there is a great risk of homelessness around the country where women are the victims of domestic violence. The housing assistance payment, HAP, money is not enough, which is limiting people's ability to escape the horrors of domestic violence. In the shadow report, refuge accommodation is shown to be very important. It says ""Refuges must be established in all 26 counties of the Republic of Ireland and easily accessible through affordable transportation"". There are nine counties where there is no refuge. In fairness, the Government is making progress towards this goal but, of course, more can and should be done. The second relevant area is that of services for victims and those at risk of domestic and gender-based violence. The shadow report states:The State must ensure that general support services providing legal advice, psychological counselling, financial assistance, housing [which I have mentioned], education, training and assistance in finding employment, access to health care and social services, court familiarisation [which is very important] and accompaniment services are resourced and effectively available to victims/survivors.On legal advice, we see what has been described as a shrinking legal aid panel. It is very difficult for many women to access solid legal advice quickly because of the absence of a large number of family law solicitors. The shadow report also cites the importance of trauma-informed training for service staff. As part of a whole-of-government approach, we would see this training extended into the likes of An Garda Síochána and the Courts Service. Progress has certainly been made within An Garda Síochána and we hope that, in the ongoing negotiations on the rosters, the worry people have about the disbandment of certain specialised domestic violence units will not be realised. The agency will also be responsible, to some extent, for carrying out research and setting overall policy direction, under the supervision of the Minister. The corporate plan, for instance, must be created by the agency under the direction of the Minister and then approved by her, once drafted, before being laid before the House. I note that, in the Minister of State's speech, he referred to recommendations that were taken on board following prelegislative scrutiny. We welcome the Bill's inclusion of several changes reflecting those recommendations, including the strengthening of provisions on stakeholder engagement, a provision that the agency will have regard to the diverse needs and circumstances of victims and another provision that the board's membership shall include persons with DSGBV-related expertise. It is good to hear that those recommendations are being taken on board.It was a point of contention during pre-legislative scrutiny, when many NGOs felt that there must be more independence for the agency. At the same time, the agency will be responsible for implementing measures to comply with the State’s obligations under the Istanbul Convention and accountability will therefore be very important. Will this compromise areas such as policy development or the need to collect statistics or assess the State’s own performance? For example, the wording of section 6 currently provides that the agency will:...undertake, commission, assist or collaborate in research (including the collection, compilation and assessment of statistical data) to support the evaluation of policies, strategies and services relating to domestic, sexual or gender-based violence and .. support generally the effective performance by the Agency of its other functions under this Act or any other enactment;It may be difficult and the fear is that it may be difficult to square this with the agency also distributing funding. The State generally can fund NGOs and other bodies which are critical of the State in turn, but when it comes to establishing the new body, we must keep that critical independent balance in mind.  The other main theme of the pre-legislative scrutiny was the need for a whole-of-government approach. The Bill currently says that the agency will act to ""coordinate, oversee and provide advice and support, as appropriate, in relation to the implementation by public service bodies of ... [those] plans"". There is no great obligation on other State agencies to collaborate and stronger powers may make some positive difference in this area. We can tease this point out further on Committee Stage and, as I have already said, we will be supporting this Bill through this Stage. We have been in touch with relevant witnesses to ask for their feedback on the Bill also following the heads of the Bill being examined. One of the areas we need to see being prioritised for the agency is domestic homicide and familicide. We are all aware, I am sure, of shocking cases and the study into familicide and domestic homicides gives a figure of at least 166 persons having died in familial violence in this century up to 2018, with the State pathologist’s office telling researchers that a further 14 cases between 2014 and 2019 did not feature in the public records. There have been many instances of that, including in my own county. Sinn Féin has long argued that family homicide review panels must be implemented with interagency collaboration taking place to ensure risk factors are identified. The study into familicide and domestic homicides is a good start and I ask the Minister of State for some sort of update in this area. The study recommended that a national database should be established for reporting on violent family deaths and for data collection as a whole. The compilation of these statistics is badly needed. We are sorely lacking in sexual violence statistics compared to, for example, the range of data available to our neighbours across the water. As I said at the time of the report’s publication, the Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence Agency Bill provides an opportunity to advance policy in this area. Every second counts for families at risk of such violence and we cannot afford to see any further delays. The data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, initial sexual violence survey of 2022 served as a sobering reminder of the importance of the third national strategy on this violence which remains woefully underfunded and under-resourced. Some 52% of women - and, we must remind ourselves, some 28% of men - have reported experiencing sexual violence, according to that survey. If Government parties are truly committed to a zero tolerance policy - I believe they are - we need to see a step change in the implementation and funding of the strategy. The agency will hopefully be an improvement in this area but the fundamentals of implementation, funding and awareness-raising will be the same no matter what."	spk_339

I support amendment No. 35, which proposes to insert ""that the historic, archaeological and cultural heritage of Ireland, as the product of the labour, craftsmanship and talent of their forbearers, belongs equally to ... the people"" and should be preserved into the future. As the Minister of State will be aware, there is a proposal by Kerry County Council to sell a portion of ground in Tralee to the Courts Service. The Courts Service has been in charge of the current courthouse in Tralee since it was established. Some Members may have been in the courthouse. There have been plans and drawings on the wall since the 1990s to provide wheelchair access and refurbish the building and keep it as a working courthouse. Since the Courts Service took over, however, all it has done with the courthouse is to provide a fridge and a new kitchen for the judges and maybe one or two new seats. Other Covid suggestions along the lines of video link and the digital audio recording system have been approved but the building itself has been allowed to fall into disrepair. There is extreme frustration among the legal community, Kerry Law Society, the Bar Council and the people of the town that this has been allowed to happen. The Courts Service then stated that the building did not fit the needs of a modern court building and should, therefore, be moved away from the centre of town. The problem is that since these proposals were mooted three or four years ago, there has been absolutely no plan to do anything with the existing building. The building is an example of craftsmanship. It was built with stone quarried from the green in Tralee town centre, where there was an old limestone quarry. It was crafted there in the 1840s, going back to the days of Daniel O'Connell, and it has hosted many famous court trials through the years. In light of the new Family Courts Bill 2022, it is a shame that other buildings, such as the old Ulster Bank, which is now closed, and the Kerry Protestant Hall, which is across the road and also constructed of limestone from the centre of town, are not being developed as a courts hub in the centre of town. The Government's town centre first plan and its proposals in respect of carbon footprint are contrary to the proposals that are being brought forward by the Courts Service. I do not think the conveyance has gone through. I hope it is not too late. Members of Kerry Law Society made a fair point. The building they use every day is falling into disrepair but the Courts Service is saying it needs a new court building. For the overall good of archaeological heritage, keeping services in the town centre and preserving them for another 170 years, that decision should be reversed. While I have the time, I will refer to a building in the ownership of the OPW. Having met with a group called Better Ballyduff, I went to see Rattoo tower, which is a very well-preserved round tower in the village of Ballyduff in north Kerry. While there, I met two German tourists with an interest in archaeology and Irish history. They were visiting two centres in Ireland, namely, Clonmacnoise and the round tower in Rattoo. Pointing works on the round tower have been ongoing for the past four or five years and access to the tower has been closed off for all that time. It is an area with massive tourism potential. There are no signs in Ballyduff to advertise this heritage site. It is located down a narrow road but access to the area has been closed off for many years and it does not look like anything will be done with it. The development of tourism potential in the area is being held back. I ask the Minister of State to look into the matter and see whether the round tower can be opened as soon as possible. There do not seem to be any great works going on but the tower is closed off and there is a small bit of scaffolding at the bottom of it. I ask him to look into the matter. Ballyduff is adjacent to the Wild Atlantic Way but there are no signs to divert tourists into the village. People are coming from Germany to visit the site because it is so well-preserved. I ask him to take that into account. I support Deputy Ó Snodaigh's amendment and thank him for tabling it."	spk_265

There is a fundamental problem with GP care around the State, and particularly in Kerry, although this is not necessarily related to a Kerry issue. We have had our own problems in Kerry finding doctors for towns and villages like Ballyduff, around the Ring of Kerry and a few years ago in Milltown. Essentially, GP care is privatised and many GPs and the HSE have to settle terms to provide care in communities. From time to time, the old Tralee Town Council instituted a scheme to help emigrants, Irish people who had been England for 30 or 40 years, to return home. It was in dealing with the Safe Home group, which is based in Mayo, that this difficulty came to pass. Many of these people sent remittances home. When times were very difficult in Ireland, they kept the country afloat and it is very important that we take care of them. One such individual contacted us, and the organisation Safe Home had received an email saying that at the moment, they could only advise that they should keep contacting GPs in the area because the HSE no longer assigns GPs to clients. The email said that for any further queries, an 0818 number could be contacted. For years, it was standard practice that if you had tried and was refused by three GPs in an area, the HSE would then step in, help you out and try to find a GP. This is very important for people in general but more so for Irish emigrants who are coming home. They may have been living in council or trust accommodation in Britain and are coming home. They may have a place arranged here but they need a medical card. One needs a medical card, as the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, knows, for carer's allowance, housing adaptation grants, the HMD1 housing form, or for people with additional needs. A GP and a medical card are needed to understand that and to get into the system, so to speak. I know that many GPs are under pressure as I have seen in my own county, and no doubt the Minister of State has seen it in hers. However, there is a serious problem. The Sláintecare recommendations have not been implemented. Obviously GPs are under pressure but the HSE is in charge of this whole policy, and really it should be stepping in. Vulnerable people who are returning home after many years abroad should be looked after. It is morally right, and it really should be encased in legality. Will the Minister of State be able to do something about it to ensure that this is not going to happen to any more vulnerable people?	spk_481
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-09-26	dail	33	Care Services	dbsect_29	I thank the Minister of State for her response. This is something that came to the attention of Safe Home Ireland on 15 September. I am not sure what arrangements have been in place since the end of June or the beginning of July but this is a category of people who are the most vulnerable and who are returning after many years abroad. Irish citizens cannot get a GP card. How is that fair or equitable for people who were forced to emigrate in the 1960s and 1970s? They spent their working lives abroad and now want to come home to spend their final years in Ireland. It sounded to me that what the Minister of State said in her response about flexible arrangements with the IMO was leaving someone off the hook. I am not sure if it is the IMO or the HSE. These are cases that should be prioritised. There are recommendations in Sláintecare about directly employing GPs. Perhaps alternative arrangements need to be considered because clearly it is not working. It is not working for someone who is most vulnerable and in the latter years of his life. He might have expected a welcome home but he is not getting that. He will be unable to access a whole load of other arrangements. I can give the Minister of State the details of this organisation and the individual concerned. Perhaps something could be looked at for him. Going forward, a policy must be put in place whereby people who qualify have a right to GP care. Any other way is unacceptable.	spk_483

Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-09-20	dail	33	Mortgage Interest Relief: Motion	dbsect_22	Over the past year, 20% of households have seen mortgage repayments increase by over €3,000. Another 20% of households have seen repayments increase by more than €5,700. Mortgage interest rates rose by over 54% in the past year, while the retail banking sector has almost doubled its profits to €5 billion. This tallies with the experience of the people I spoke to this week in County Kerry. In the last year, the mortgage of one couple with two children in college has increased by €600 per month. The mortgage of another woman, who is a single parent, went from €1,330 per month to €2,000 per month with a vulture fund. This is in a county where disposable income consistently ranks below the national average, and where people are struggling with the cost of living, with fuel costs which have recently increased and with food prices. This is in a State where 30,000 people are in mortgage arrears and 78,000 mortgages are held by vulture funds, some of which are on rates as high as 10%. This, of course, was all facilitated by the Government. We must remember two things. Despite being consistently asked, the Government has refused to introduced temporary targeted mortgage interest reliefs in order to deal with rising mortgage costs. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael supported a number of breaks for those vulture funds, supporting the sale of mortgages to vulture funds without the consent of mortgage holders, giving vulture funds an exemption from stamp duty, and then giving other tax breaks on renting properties, all the time exposing struggling mortgage holders to higher interest rates. Big breaks for bad banks. Here is what the vulture funds are doing. The vulture fund buys a mortgage of a local family of around €200,000 from a departing bank for approximately €65,000, which is about 33% of the size of the loan. Then the vulture fund raises the interest rate ten times and it links that rate to rises to the ECB rate. However, more than likely, if the fund did borrow, it borrowed at a fraction of high street rates and in reality, although it is not linked to the ECB, it passes on every single rate rise and offers no fixed rate to those struggling families. Tens of thousands of people will not be able to meet the repayments. They will eventually sell and the vulture fund will triple the money, plus interest, or if it restructures, will eventually collect more. Consumer protection authorities say that there is currently a divide-and-conquer strategy by the vulture funds. To the people, there appears to be no regulation. Many will either sell up or be forced to seek local authority help. Anger is rising among these struggling families that the Government is not regulating or assisting with mortgage interest relief. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party are increasingly out of touch with the many people who are joining the swollen ranks of the working poor and contemplating emigration. I support this motion. The Government needs to intervene. We need action and a rebalancing in favour of struggling families and away from vulture funds. The Government needs to provide mortgage interest relief to principal residences equivalent to 30% of increased interest costs since June 2022. It needs to increase the banking levy to support households and to develop a clear plan to help those people and to reintegrate those mortgage holders with loans held by vulture funds into the mainstream mortgage market. 	spk_207

The captain of our B team was from Tibet. Looking around at the three teams present, there were also Ukrainians and Nigerians. The most inclusive and welcoming sports clubs in the country are probably those that play football. It is the international game that reaches all the way down to the local level. The positivity and inclusivity were there to be seen locally. We are at a crossroads in terms of investing in the game and facilitating its expansion. There is a significant lack of municipal facilities. Around the Continent, there is a place in nearly every square where someone can muck in and play football. There has been a considerable expansion in the women’s game. Significant investment is needed. I welcome this Labour Party motion. I see from it that 55% of clubs do not own their own their facilities. When CLÁR funding was recently provided, it seemed to me that most of the clubs in Kerry that had applied did not get the funding they deserved for all the work they had been putting into their communities. The silver bullet is facilities. We need more funding for them at local and national levels.	spk_29

Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-07-11	dail	33	EU Regulation on the Transfer of Proceedings in Criminal Matters: Motion	dbsect_13	"As the Minister stated, organised crime is becoming increasingly transnational and this proposal aims to address that development, along with other concerns. It is useful to put on record recent developments in organised crime throughout Europe. In April, Interpol announced its largest firearms trafficking operations, which saw more than 14,000 suspects arrested across Central America and South America and an unprecedented €5.7 billion in illegal narcotics seized. In May, the organisation held its 50th European regional conference, at which its secretary general, Jürgen Stock, commented on these arrests, ""Over the last five years, [drug] trafficking and consumption have increased by an order of magnitude, with Europe one of the main transit and destination markets."" He further stated, ""We continue to see record seizures at European borders and ports, and a corresponding rise in violent crime, corruption and money laundering of unprecedented scale."" A 2022 Interpol survey of its members highlighted that money laundering and cybercrime were a major concern. The Interpol Global Crime Trend report stated:Financial crimes and cybercrime are invariably linked, as a significant amount of financial fraud takes place through digital technologies (making it ""cyber-enabled"") and cybercriminals also depend on financial fraud to launder their illicit gains. In this way, while ""cybercrime-as-a-service"" is a well-known criminal concept, the pandemic has also hastened the emergence of ""financial crime-as-a-service"", including digital money laundering tools that can prove critical for criminals seeking to cash out.We in Ireland have seen the results of crime and drug trafficking, which have filtered down to every local village. There is an increasing amount of co-operation rather than competition between groups but these actions are still backed by a threat of violence. Although the groups know murder might be bad for business, they still rely on intimidation and gun-running when they need to so do. The efforts of the EU in this area also deserve to be highlighted. The European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats, EMPACT, had good results in 2022, leading to 9,900 arrests, identification of 4,000 victims of trafficking, the seizure of €180 million and 62 tonnes and the initiation of 9,200 investigations. Closer to home, serious crime still rears its head. Comparisons with 2020 and 2021 are difficult due to the pandemic but offences such as attempts or threats to murder, assaults, harassments and related offences, damage to property and kidnapping all increased from 2019 to 2022.There are obvious ongoing investigations and court cases that would not be appropriate to detail here but which are relevant. However, there are other concerns and issues that this proposal addresses beyond just the transnational context. The first relates to the individual human rights of persons. As the Commission itself put it: ""Parallel or multiple prosecutions can be inefficient and ineffective, but also possibly detrimental to the rights of individuals concerned as a person may not be prosecuted or punished for the same offence twice. It is a criminal law principle that a person cannot be punished or be subject to several procedures twice."" In a lot of criminal law jurisdictions, including our own, the double jeopardy rule is essentially the same. The temptation first and foremost is to look at the punitive aspect of law but courts will strike down laws where they do not circumscribe individual rights in a manner proportionate to their aim. This proposal addresses other issues that arise in cross-border investigations and trials. Duplicate investigations mean resources can be wasted, and hearings in other countries can see witnesses called in a number of countries. This may increase the risk of the intimidation of witnesses, or maybe even non-engagement. According to the briefing we received, in order to combat this, this proposal is to improve the efficient and proper administration of justice within the EU; to improve the respect of fundamental rights in the process of transfer of criminal proceedings; to improve the efficiency and legal certainty of transfer of criminal proceedings; and to enable the transfer of criminal proceedings where they are in the interest of justice but currently not possible between member states, and reduce the phenomenon of impunity. I welcome some of the safeguards the Minister mentioned in her opening statement, that it is not proposed to impose an obligation to accept a request for a transfer of proceedings and member states are afforded a wide range of grounds for refusal. It is important these criteria must be met before the transfers are effected. However, we can expect some significant difficulties with implementing these proposals. The transfer of prisoners between countries can be fraught with complexity, which has only recently been addressed after years of legal challenges. It is right and proper we maintain our own system for prosecuting and sentencing, and proposals such as these would have to grapple with that reality. Notwithstanding this, the proposal has merit and Sinn Féin will not be opposing it. I also note from the Minister's opening statement that there are four elements to the criteria: that the criminal offence must have taken place wholly or partly within the state; that the person is a national or resident of the state; the state has refused to surrender the person; or where most of the evidence is located in the requested state. Overall, I welcome the proposal and will not be objecting to it."	spk_155

Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-07-11	dail	33	Prison Service	dbsect_17	The motto of the Garda is always to address not only the causes of crime but also the fear of crime. Of great concern in recent months has been the situation on O'Connell Street and serious incidents which have happened on the streets close by. One of our Dublin Deputies told me recently about a bus driver who was badly assaulted, with cuts around his face and neck, when he tried to fight off a robbery attempt. While restraining one attacker, he was set upon by another, who tried to gouge his eye out. Thankfully, he escaped, but he had severe injuries to his head and face. This concern has been raised with me by a few Dublin Deputies and by some bus drivers. Other bus drivers have been assaulted while working around O'Connell Street and similar areas. This needs to be addressed. The programme for Government promises proper community policing. It is not just Dublin where there is a problem with this. It seems that the community police are the first to be cut when there is a recruitment crisis. I am thinking of Killarney, my town, where there is currently no community garda in place.	spk_398

Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-07-11	dail	33	Antisocial Behaviour	dbsect_18	The motto of the Garda is always to address not only the causes of crime but also the fear of crime. Of great concern in recent months has been the situation on O'Connell Street and serious incidents which have happened on the streets close by. One of our Dublin Deputies told me recently about a bus driver who was badly assaulted, with cuts around his face and neck, when he tried to fight off a robbery attempt. While restraining one attacker, he was set upon by another, who tried to gouge his eye out. Thankfully, he escaped, but he had severe injuries to his head and face. This concern has been raised with me by a few Dublin Deputies and by some bus drivers. Other bus drivers have been assaulted while working around O'Connell Street and similar areas. This needs to be addressed. The programme for Government promises proper community policing. It is not just Dublin where there is a problem with this. It seems that the community police are the first to be cut when there is a recruitment crisis. I am thinking of Killarney, my town, where there is currently no community garda in place.	spk_398

That is why we have been keeping an eye on the EPA reports over recent years.Water quality can, of course, be impacted by a number of different factors. One statistic in the report that jumped out at us was concerning, namely, that there are two river water bodies in bad condition. There was in a place in County Clare and the Laune in County Kerry, where it says that urban wastewater is a pressure. The Minister of State knows the area well. Does he believe the Killarney sewage treatment plant is fit for purpose, especially during the summer months with all the extra tourists who visit Killarney? The report refers to Lough Leane and that a great deal of damage has been done there. At the moment, the toxic algae bloom signs are up, which is very disappointing in a premier tourist destination like Killarney. Around the county, it has already been referenced about the lack of wastewater treatment plants in such places as Castlegregory, Abbeydorney and in Fenit where I recently dealt with people living in Lighthouse Village. Even though a system was made by the developer, they cannot connect to the system because two houses cannot be built in Fenit, as there is no system in place. It does not look like one is coming anytime soon. Despite a blaze of publicity a number of years ago which said it was coming, there is nothing happening there yet. Uisce Éireann also needs to carry out assessments around Cromane, in the Magharees, in Tralee Bay, and into the Kenmare River. Closer to home there is the big river which flows right down through the north side of Tralee and goes directly through the centre of the town, and there are septic tanks going into that river. Permission was granted by the local authority. No funding has been allocated towards a river going right through the centre of Tralee town. It is within a few hundred yards of county council buildings. If there was ever a priority, that should be it.	spk_214
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-06-28	dail	33	Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022: From the Seanad	dbsect_26	We will also be opposing this amendment. There is definitely something going on here and I would be interested in hearing the case from the Government for this amendment. A lot of concern has been expressed about it. It is already the view of many that the DPC uses its powers to direct non-disclosure far too liberally and this is only going to increase that practice. I have some sympathy for the DPC because it is working within the constraints imposed upon it by the Government. I note that some extra funding was provided after we advocated for it but there is an issue of accountability here. The proposed section 26A, which was introduced like a three-card trick at the last minute, is going to allow the DPC to single-handedly declare virtually all procedures before it confidential, even if there is no commercially sensitive material discussed, and sharing information about procedures would become a criminal offence. Has this been run past the Attorney General? Does the Attorney General have an opinion on it? Is it compliant with the right to freedom of expression? It has been criticised across Europe and at home. Why are we rushing this through? Why is it not in a stand-alone Bill or in some other Bill rather than being lumped in with this legislation? The new language will apply to members of the public. Confidentiality conditions previously applied to the DPC's staff but there is an exemption for the staff when speech is permitted by law. However, members of the public have that legal permission to speak provided in the Constitution which seems to make the amendment moot. Has the amendment been adequately considered? We have heard Government spokespersons in recent times denying that this is a last-minute intervention. They said the Dáil was notified in October or November but very little was said and it was clouded in vagueness. There has been no pre-legislative scrutiny of this and no debate in the Dáil until now. Aside from the briefest of mentions, nothing much was said in the Seanad either. These ministerial amendments should be subject to the same scrutiny as any other amendments made as the Bill was passing through. Only a single hour has been allowed to us to debate this amendment, along with 23 other amendments, before the Bill is passed. We should not be rushing this. The amendment should be withdrawn. Government spokespeople have said the amendment will not prevent people from saying that they have sent a complaint to the DPC but I am not sure that is the case. What matters is that the amendment could gag people and prevent them from speaking about how the DPC actually handles their complaint. People might not be able to speak about how big tech firms or public bodies are misusing their data. That is an opinion that is out there. For example, will it still be possible to use disclosures made at the Oireachtas Committee on Justice in the past or will the DPC be able to silence critics and cut off some sources? There has been a new era of fairness and openness in the light of new litigation guidelines. The Supreme Court has said that even quasi-judicial bodies should hold public hearings. In contrast, this amendment will make decision-making even more opaque, adding to the exemptions from freedom of information rules that could have aided in its reform. I urge the Minister of State to consider withdrawing the amendment and allowing proper scrutiny of it at a later stage.	spk_242
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-06-27	dail	33	Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009: Motions	dbsect_16	"I move:To delete all words after ""Dáil Éireann"" and substitute the following:"":— resolves that sections 2 to 4, 6 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 (No. 39 of 1998) shall continue in operation for the period beginning on 30th June, 2023 and ending on 29th June, 2024; and— calls on the Minister for Justice to bring forward legislation to give effect to the recommendations of the Independent Review Group as soon as possible."".I thank the Minister for publishing the review in advance last week. The Offences against the State Act goes back to an Ireland of 84 years ago - 1939 and the outbreak of the Second World War. The legislation introduced internment camps in the Curragh in Kildare where de Valera imprisoned without trial republicans, German soldiers who had strayed off course and some communists. When Hamilton Neil Goold-Verschoyle, who was a communist, began political classes in the Curragh, a bishop contacted de Valera and had him removed to another prison, which I believe was Arbour Hill, for spreading such foreign propaganda. It was an era of executions and military tribunals. Brendan Behan was interned there and later wrote  I knew some of the men were interned back then, such as Tomo Costello, Denna Fitzgerald from Tralee, a Kerry footballer, and the Landers brothers. Some of them were still alive when I was younger. Others I heard about, such as Mr. Goold-Verschoyle, Mr. Kinch, the famous writer Máirtín Ó Cadhain and Brendan Behan. Austin Clarke wrote a poem about them. Some were executed after speedy trials and buried beside the path between the main gate and the old women’s prison in Mountjoy. Those men are all dead now but the emergency legislation introduced during what this State euphemistically called the Emergency trundles on and gets us from A to B, or from 2022 to 2023. Nobody can argue with any substance that the circumstances that gave rise to the introduction of this emergency legislation exist today. Even if we were to disregard the Second World War legislation, there were 497 prosecutions back in 2008 under the renewable sections, while in 2022, there were seven. There is a contradiction between what is said in the annual report - the views of the Garda authorities that the second Special Criminal Court is indicative of the use of the court and why it is necessary and what the Minister said, which is that only 21 cases were held there in the past year. Recently, we all commemorated the Good Friday Agreement in the 25th year since its passing by the people of this island. It is an internationally binding agreement and other agreements have followed since in relation to the North, yet the Government has continued to run away from its role in implementing these agreements. It is happy to be pictured when agreements are signed but not to face up to the hard work of implementing them. Nowhere is this more clear than in its foot dragging relating to the Offences against the State Act. There are also important Good Friday Agreement considerations. The Hederman committee arose out of the Good Friday Agreement. It spoke about the importance of equivalence between jurisdictions on this island. Again I hope this review will not lie unimplemented for 20 years and that the comprehensive and well-researched report produced by Michael Peart’s highly regarded team can drag Irish anti-criminal gang legislation into the 21st century.The Good Friday Agreement is unambiguous in the obligations it imposed. It says: ""The Irish Government will initiate a wide-ranging review of the Offences Against the State Acts 1939-85 [and beyond, we say] with a view to ... reform and dispensing with those elements no longer required as circumstances permit.” Yet the Hederman review was never implemented. These elements were not dispensed with, and 21 years after that review, the work needed to be redone. Hederman's report said: As will be seen from the Committee's detailed analysis of this legislation contained in succeeding chapters of this Report, it believes that what is now required in a modern environment is for the Oireachtas to repeal the existing Offences against the State Acts and to replace them with one single consolidated item of legislation containing significant reforms in respect of the statutory regime which has heretofore obtained.This quote is from the Hederman review, not the recent one, published in 2002, although one could be mistaken for thinking it comes from the most recent review. There is an old saying about doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. The Government is guilty of this, with the renewal of this legislation serving nothing more than its own political expediency. We know that communities want to feel safe and we wanted to contribute to this discussion, this review and this modernisation of the law. In Sinn Féin we sought, we secured support for and we were the only party which made a submission to the review group. One of these was more a political recommendation but the other recommendations were that the use of the emergency legislation should come to an end; that the practices of other jurisdictions be examined and the Law Reform Commission's recommendations be implemented; and should the committee recommend that non-jury trials remain in exceptional circumstances, that each case be decided on its merits and that reasonable and objective grounds be given for any decision to hold a non-jury trial  The report was released by the Minister last week. The report endorses very significantly and vindicates our position and our contribution and I most definitely welcome its publication. What is most welcome, apart from its legal recommendations, is the advocacy of the momentum to the modernisation of our criminal justice system. It proposes that this is not be based upon conjecture or fear. Aneurin Bevan used to talk of fear of the bogeyman and used to say that if one does not have a programme then a bogeyman will do. It should be based on statistics and data which can objectively state why a long-held desire for jury trials be maintained. The report sends a message to the entire system that we need this data to improve justice for victims of crime, not only in this situation but for domestic and sexual violence, where it is sorely lacking in comparison to neighbouring jurisdictions. I have been listening to what the Government has been saying since the publication of this report and we hope, maybe against expectation because I can detect lethargy, prevarication and excuses layering across each other over the past week, this new report will be implemented. I have listened to Government spokespersons saying that we must consult, discuss and inform ourselves and that we require consideration. There is no commitment, however, no sense of urgency, no desire to grasp the baton from the review committee and to carry it along to the final lap to legislation to improve, to renew and to modernise. That suits the Government. The report itself proposes abolishing the separate scheduled offences, abolishing the Offences against the State Act and appointing a judge to review the decision to send to the non-jury court and whether the provisions of the legislation have been complied with by the DPP in any case where a decision is issued that a case can be tried in a non-jury court. It suggests obliging the DPP to consider in every case whether there are measures that could be taken, or protections that could be provided, to address any reasonably or known risk of jury intimidation and therefore negate the need for trial in a non-jury court. It also suggests that the Garda Commissioner should personally approve any submission by gardaí that the use of the non-jury court is appropriate. It further requires the DPP personally, herself, to make the decisions as to whether a non-jury court be used. There is also work to be carried out by the Legislature regarding alternative measures to protect jurors where potential risks arise and therefore negate the necessity for trial in the non-jury court. That is where we can have a debate. The report also says that an accused should not be convicted solely on belief evidence, suggests the use of a ""privilege"" judge, and that inferences from silence should not be sole corroboration, and thus clearing out the outdated and holding on to essential weapons in the fight against criminal enterprises. We want such changes to be both human rights compliant but also safe for communities, for victims of crime and for gardaí themselves. We are willing to play our part in that. We must remember that the legislation is, in the words of the authors of the new report, not intended to be implemented ""on a piecemeal basis"". While I have sympathy with the recommendations of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, in regards to the scheduled offences, which the Labour Party attempted to introduce with its amendment, we do need to avoid a piecemeal approach. All of this is in the context of modernisation of the whole system, which I mentioned earlier. The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland made several recommendations relating to cybercrime and cybersecurity, with more resources and the fast-tracking of recruitment recommended. These recommendations must be implemented and the vacancies and staff turnover within the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, should be addressed also. We have also seen several major cyber-attacks take place on State institutions and we cannot be seen as a soft touch by any rogue states. Other measures outside of the court system are also required. The recruitment of forensic accountants and other experts and specialists as required within CAB and other bodies charged with fighting financial crime should be prioritised. There have been a number of delays in transposing EU legislation in this area and cross-border collaboration will require robust legislative frameworks to be in place. Referrals to the Court of Justice of the European Union were only narrowly avoided.We need modernisation and not the renewal of outdated legislation. As we and others have stated repeatedly, the idea of having to renew legislation each and every year is not ideal. If this renewal did not exist, the Government would probably feel the need to invent it. On the one hand it has accepted the overwhelming weight of legal and academic analysis in establishing the review and publishing the report, but is acting as though it does not want the circus of this renewal vote to end. The Government insists that the special court works and paints all opposition to it as somewhat subversive, but it wishes to be congratulated on the work of others in seeking change. It is for the Government's own political ends to create this political set piece every year. Look at what we have seen from successive Fine Gael Ministers for Justice since they took control of the Department about 12 years ago. There is a retention and recruitment crisis in the Garda. I spoke recently to a garda in west Dublin who said that pre-Covid, there were 23 gardaí on his unit and now there are only 12. Courts across the State have very significant backlogs and lengthy waits for trials. Coroners' courts have delays and families cannot move on while waiting and wondering what happened to their loved ones who have passed. Legislation to combat white-collar crime, the handmaiden of serious and organised crime, has been implemented past EU deadlines. Certain crime levels are increasing. Prisons are starved of necessary resources, increasing risks to staff and public safety. The report of the review group offers a way forward. There is a serious and credible threat from organised crime. These groups rely on instilling fear within vulnerable communities and think little of compromising and infiltrating the justice system. All courts need to be integrated into a single reformed modern criminal justice system, without the annual provisions. Resources must be provided to An Garda Síochána. The majority opinion of the report backs this very clearly and says: ""Many of the recommendations which follow throughout this report are simply a reiteration of what the Hederman Committee recommended in 2002."" The review is clear in its view that the current system should not continue. There are great merits in the views of the majority and the minority and we will consider them fully whenever the enabling legislation is brought forward, hopefully as soon as possible. I appeal to the Minister to refrain from the temptation to hold this set piece again next year. We have moved an amendment to call upon her to implement the recommendations of the report, and not on a piecemeal basis but as soon as possible. I hope the Minister will respect these recommendations in full. The work to implement the report can be completed and a Bill moved soon. An implementation body, which we have seen in other aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, has been established and should be established here. We are facilitating and will facilitate this. We will work with the Government. We do not want to come back again here next year and that is why we urge all Deputies to accept our amendment and to put an end to this."	spk_146

I wish to address the current context of the courts and their functioning before turning to the proposals at hand. The State had 3.27 judges per 100,000 people in 2020, well below the European average of 17.6 judges. The recent moves have improved this but more must be done. The judicial planning working group's report has been addressed a number of times within this House and Sinn Féin broadly welcomes the report and the Government's move to appoint more judges. I note that four High Court judges were appointed this week. I am curious as to how the other recommendations are progressing, especially the review of the District Court and Circuit Court areas. As we stated previously, the review needs to take into account accessibility and geography and not just to seek to rationalise resources. We all know that many District Courts throughout the State have been closed this century, which is contrary to justice being done and being seen to be done in our communities. I am also eager to hear details of the judicial resources planning model and what the proposed more flexible working arrangements are. Obviously, these reforms, and the ones contained within this motion, will place pressure on staff in the Courts Service. They do important work and are currently at maximum capacity and their numbers have never recovered from austerity times. This is also the case in coroner's offices, which form an important part of the justice system. The I think the system is broken, there are too many barristers scrabbling for too little work, monopolies of big firms, the briefing policy, pressures on the smaller solicitor firms. She continued:People told me I didn't charge enough. The bigger firms want to brief somebody who will charge a fortune so that they can justify charging a fortune...The bottom line is profit. Who is representing the ordinary person?That ordinary person and access to justice must be at the heart of everything we do in relation to the justice system. Our consideration of these proposals are no different. According to the EU, the e-CODEX system is composed of an e-CODEX access point, consisting of an interoperable gateway, which allows the secure exchange of information over a telecommunications network with other gateways to be carried out and a connector to link connected IT systems to the gateway for the purpose of exchanging data with other such IT systems. The system also contains digital procedural standards and has supporting software products, documentation and other assets listed in the annexe to the relevant regulation. According to the briefing, the e-CODEX regulation and the digitalisation proposals will facilitate electronic communication between member states in cross-border judicial proceedings and will be vital to the exchange of documents in certain types of criminal and civil cases. Again according to the briefing, participation ensures the availability and use of electronic means of communication in cross-border cases. This is to ensure that documents are not refused or denied legal effect solely on the grounds of their electronic form. The effects of the proposal seem positive, albeit we need to bear in mind data protection and storage concerns. We also need to bear in mind that some member states have engaged in the over-prosecution of political activists and played fast and loose with civil liberties. Providing for these proposals improves the sharing of documents but does not create a legal right to them being shared without adequate legal supervision that is acceptable. I have some concerns about the timing of the process. The Department has advised that the State is not participating in six of the affected instruments or legal Acts. At the same time, participation within the digitalisation proposals within the three-month deadline was not possible. Therefore, again according to the Department, approval is now sought at this stage to allow for the making of the necessary opt-in notifications immediately on the adoption of those proposals. From what the Minister of State outlined earlier, I understand he did get legal advice. The Attorney General has said no legal or constitutional issues arise but more details on the deadline and why it was missed would be welcome.	spk_211

I raise the disappointment, frustration and frankly the anger felt by retained fire fighters at the Government's handling of the recruitment and retention crisis within the fire service. Last night, Sinn Féin brought a motion to resolve this crisis and many fire fighters travelled to the Dáil to listen to the debate, hopeful that the Minister would see sense. Following his contribution, the Government and the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, received their response when dozens of retained fire fighters stood up and walked out. There is a real feeling that the Minister has opted to condemn the retained fire service with dismissive comments and at this point, it would take an extraordinary gesture to prevent a full-scale strike from next week across the State. Will the Taoiseach review the response last night and the lip service and act immediately to bring an end to the crisis before it is too late?	spk_144
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-06-14	dail	33	Our Rural Future Policy: Statements	dbsect_16	"I thought it appropriate to begin with a quote from the Government's website with regard to Our Rural Future: Rural Development Policy 2021-2025. It states:While the term ""rural Ireland"" is widely used, there are many different perceptions of what ""rural Ireland"" means. The fact is that rural areas are not identical and every town, village and parish differs considerably in terms of its individual strengths, needs and possibilities.That is correct. The experiences of somebody living, for example, in an estate in Tralee, a house in Kenmare or a house around the Ring of Kerry can be very different. There are many things that unite them, however, and that is the feeling of being left behind, poor access to healthcare and the labour market, particularly dental services and GP services, and an increasing disenfranchisement and dissatisfaction with the Government. If we look at some of the LEADER funding, which is the bedrock that massively supports rural communities in rural social schemes and community employment, CE, schemes, between 2014 and 2020, there was €10.2 million, which is around €1.7 million per year, yet for 2023 to 2027, it is €8.1 million, which works out at approximately €1.6 million. Factor in inflation and it is a decrease for those essential services. The strategy promises much in areas with priorities including optimising digital connectivity, supporting employment and careers in rural areas, revitalising towns and villages, enhancing participation, leadership and resilience and supporting carbon neutrality. However, are the rural communities going to see much of a return in these areas? Rural broadband connectivity, for example, in County Kerry is still very patchy. Many areas do not have a clear timeline for when they will be connected. Given that working from home requires good service and provision for this is uncertain, many of those who would like to move back home to their county are unable to do so. It is hard to detect much progress in the attempt at revitalising towns and villages. Dereliction of commercial units is still very high in Tralee town. A number of retail units are still closing and there are little signs of recovery. Public bodies and county councils need to step up to the plate. In the programme for Government, for example, we have the Town Centre First plan, but when the council talks about a new building, it is extending that building at the edge of town rather than pushing services into the town centres and getting people working there. All the surveys about dereliction that were taken in England, for example, have shown that to revitalise town centres, we need to have people living there and, more importantly, people working there."	spk_227
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-05-31	dail	33	Criminal Justice (Engagement of Children in Criminal Activity) Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_13	The Bill is a welcome development, especially in light of the work done by my colleagues, Deputies Ward and Martin Kenny, in this area. The maximum sentence is somewhat lower than that proposed by Sinn Féin but we can examine this further on Committee Stage. It is becoming increasingly clear that the engagement of young people in serious and organised crime is a concern. We must be careful about scaremongering around crime but children are among the most vulnerable in our society. Traditionally, criminal law treats children differently from adults, as they are not able to interact with society and exercise proper judgment and self-control, and rightly so. That is why, over the years, they have had more access to juvenile liaison officers, JLOs, restorative justice, albeit not as much as one would like, as well as probation services and community sanctions. They are susceptible to the influence of others, especially adults, and the Bill is an attempt to square a circle that exists between children committing, in some cases, serious offences within an organised command structure and the need to turn them away from a life of crime. Too many children are caught up in these acts from a young age at the instigation of an adult. This then exposes them to prison or other detention facilities during a crucial time when they would otherwise be learning skills important for their social and economic development. Prison can too often replace an educational facility and serve as one, with crime being the curriculum.  Although not necessarily under the remit of the Bill, we should acknowledge that young adults are undergoing a period of mental and emotional development in their later teenage years. In my time in the community, I saw this all too often, with vulnerable young people falling foul of the system and being set on a course of offending. Indeed, some of the same defendants would show up in court throughout the years as they grew older, stuck in a cycle of incarceration and reoffending, with convictions that would prevent, if not prohibit their advancement. For those who did escape the cycle, which is possible, the fundamentals of housing, education and rehabilitation from the mental and physical traumas they had experienced were always key. Where these are available, young people stand a chance but all too often they are not. The Government's commitment to evolving towards a public and community safety approach is important, especially for children. Tusla, the Probation Service and a proper youth justice agency all need to be part of a wraparound approach along with housing and health services.  In terms of who the Bill is aimed at, we are seeing an increased confidence among gang leaders and the showcasing of elaborate and affluent lifestyles on social media sites is a major part of this. Within communities where economic opportunity is limited, it makes for an attractive recruitment pitch and the use of children within the economic functions of a drug gang becomes much easier as a result. Children, those with no criminal record and others, are often used to transport or hold money and drugs. They are less likely to arouse suspicion and can be treated as expendable.  The Government needs to get serious in this area. Our demoralised and depleted Garda force is stretched too far to be able to deal with the problem. Clearly, the targets that have been set for recruitment into An Garda Síochána this year are unlikely to be met. The Government has actually moved its targets towards the end of 2024 because there have not been enough entrants to the courses in Templemore this year. That issue needs to be addressed, as well as looking at the Garda diversion programme, resourcing communities, improving and funding community employment, CE, schemes and family resource centres along with a dedicated youth justice agency and other measures necessary to improve the situation.	spk_287

Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-05-24	dail	33	Extension of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021: Motion	dbsect_15	I think I speak for most in this House when I say that the requirement for the Oireachtas to approve measures and ensure oversight is overwhelmingly positive. I am equally sure that many will welcome the fact that this motion is one of the few remaining legacies on the Statute Book relating to the pandemic. On behalf of Sinn Féin, I moved a Private Member's Bill to strengthen parliamentary oversight of pandemic restrictions. The Health (Parliamentary Oversight of Certain Instruments Relating to Covid-19) Bill 2021 proposed to amend the Health Act 1947 and provide parliamentary oversight of regulations made by the Minister for Health under section 31A of that Act and of orders made by the Minister under section 31B. This reflected the situation in New Zealand and was brought to the Covid-19 committee at the time by Dr. David Kenny of Trinity College. The Bill proposed, in general, to provide for time limits within which such an order or regulations have to be confirmed by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas so that they can continue to have effect. Otherwise they would be annulled but without prejudice to any prosecution previously taken under the same regulations. The Bill proposed to enable either House of the Oireachtas by resolution to annul such an order or regulations before the expiration of the time limit, again without prejudice to anything previously taken. This was a sensible way for any resolution requiring approval of the Oireachtas to operate. This mode of operation would require the Executive to give the Parliament time to scrutinise and affirm any regulations or orders and would help restore the separation of powers between the Parliament and the Government, from a position where it can be compromised by the dominance of a Government with a large majority. From the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Government introduced different regulations under the Health Act 1947 with restrictions on liberties and it was only right and proper that Parliament was to be given a greater role in scrutinising the restrictions. There were various things such proposals to enable juries to be sworn in using larger halls and so on. I note what the Minister of State said about extending the sunset clause to allow the hospitality industry to continue to provide the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor in outdoor seating areas which has worked largely successfully in the past few years. As the Minister of State said, there was a demand for facilities that would allow businesses to operate with the necessary clarity and certainty about the law on outdoor dining services as there was a lot of confusion at that time. As the Minister of State said, it was clear the industry as a whole needed a more comprehensive solution, although having spoken to some of its representatives in the past few days, I note they express certain concerns around duty of care. No doubt they will be dealt with in the proposed Act. We hope, as does the Minister of State, that the sale of alcohol Bill will remove the need for the renewal of these specific provisions to provide the necessary clarity with the checks and balances that are necessary in any Bill relating to alcohol. We note it will come before the Joint Committee on Justice and the Minister of State has said it will come before the Dáil in 2023. We look forward to the pre-legislative scrutiny and a fuller consultation on the Bill when it comes before the House on Second, Committee and Report Stages. In the other part of his statement, the Minister of State went into some other issues about support for An Garda Síochána, including the unprecedented budget which will support the recruitment of up to 1,000 new Garda members in 2023. It is my understanding that in the first five months of this year, there was a proposal to bring in 425 additional gardaí but the Department is falling short of those recruitment targets. Approximately 288 recruits have started to study in Templemore. There will be a natural fall off of between 5% and 10% and all of the 288 are unlikely to eventually attest. Even up to last week the increased number of resignations from An Garda Síochána continued apace. In the headquarters circular which was issued to members last week, circular 10 of 2023, a further nine resignations and 15 retirements were notified. If we do the maths on that, it is quite clear that the Government might support the potential recruitment of up to 1,000 new Garda members, but it is more likely than not that the additional Garda members' target will not be met at this stage. The one thing gardaí, who are suffering from a serious crisis of morale, need is additional gardaí on the front line as additional support for them when they go out on the streets but it appears that those targets will not be met. Getting back to the motion, the effects of the pandemic also persist in the health service. A temporary paid leave scheme for public health service employees who are unfit to work after contracting Covid-19 is due to expire in July, but many cannot return to work because they are suffering from long Covid-19. There are well-documented challenges in this week's Private Member's motion that would likely have been a problem had there not been a pandemic but those issues have been exacerbated. In the rental sector, rents remain sky high. While it may have been hoped in Government circles that vacancies would increase and prices drop during the pandemic, without any action on its part, this did not materialise. Instead Government inaction led to rent continuing to increase. Despite this, the Government lifted the eviction ban and in the coming months we will see more and more evictions occurring.The rising cost of inputs, some of which is due to the pandemic, has been one of the factors that has stalled new house builds. Only one affordable home was delivered in County Kerry last year and that is not acceptable. The shortfall from Covid has not helped either. The labour market has tipped slightly back in favour of the worker, with shortages of skills and people in most industries. This has not been accompanied by wage growth or Government action to increase worker protections. Ministers spoke of a new-found appreciation for manual workers during the pandemic, but now that the pandemic is over, one must ask how much these workers, who are people working in retail, as healthcare assistants or as school secretaries, are appreciated in reality by the Government. On this motion, we support the continuation of these measures, and I would like to quote my colleague, Deputy O’Reilly, on the issue of keeping our towns and cities going because there is no doubt these regulations have been of assistance to a more expansive and better choice for pubs and restaurants:After we exit the Covid crisis, if we want to get people back into our towns and cities and engaging with retail and hospitality services, then we have to offer people a greater experience. We have to make people want to spend time in our towns and cities, to enjoy themselves, and to spend money in retail and hospitality.[...]We need outdoor dining and drinking spaces, we need true public spaces where people can relax, we need outdoor and indoor markets, we need public space for arts and culture, we need public toilets, and we need to make sure our towns and cities cater for those who live there.When I speak to people in places like Killarney, Listowel, Tralee, they agree with these sentiments. We need to strike the right balance between opportunities to consume alcohol and undertake other leisure pursuits on the one hand, and the right of people to enjoy towns and villages safely and securely on the other hand. It is also important that public sector organisations, such as local authorities, keep town centres in mind if they are constructing new buildings or if they are extending existing premises, to have an emphasis on maintaining town centres, and to put more workers and staff working in the middle of town, rather than on the edge, to assist with getting people back into towns and cities. The studies have always shown that it is not enough to have people living in town centres but that there must be people working there as well if we are to keep them vibrant. I note that in my town of Tralee there has been a downgrading of the town centre, which has not been helped by some of the larger employers locating to the edge of town. That must also be addressed.	spk_182
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-05-24	dail	33	Court Proceedings (Delays) Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_19	"I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, his officials or whoever compiled the report I have before me. It is clear and raises several interesting questions in respect of how the Bill will be implemented. To begin at the end of the Bill, it provides for a number of miscellaneous matters, including that the assessment application may be made on behalf of a party to proceedings where such person is under the age of 18 or ill or has a disability. The Minister stated that an authorisation is made in that context. It is sort of based on the injuries board application form. However, the application to the Circuit Court must be made within three months of the date of the authorisation. That is a very brief period within which to take legal advice, having received the authorisation, and prepare proceedings for an application to the Circuit Court. Six months is allowed at the injuries board and the three-month period proposed under the Bill seems very short. What are the officials examining in that regard? Anyone who is making an application for this type of compensation will probably have legal aid. Are officials exploring an extension of the legal aid scheme? The Minister of State made the point that consideration is being given to providing for a nominal application fee to guard against unmeritorious claims. It is a new scheme and it would be very difficult for a person who may be entitled to compensation to proceed on what will be a new and complicated area of law without legal advice. I am interested to see what will come forward at a later stage with regard to how that will be implemented. Everybody is entitled to a fair trial. If people are to be punished if the assessment is equal to or less than what is assessed by one of these new assessors, that might be a very unfair decision. As the Minister of State laid out, the Bill provides for compensation where Article 6 has been breached and the State is obliged to implement it. Article 6 states, ""In the determination of ... civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge ... everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law."" The Minister of State recognised that under the ECHR there is a right to a fair trial within a reasonable time and an effective and accessible remedy as required by Article 13 of the convention. As the old maxim goes, justice delayed is justice denied. With all the delays in the courts at the moment, people are not receiving trials within a reasonable timeframe. I will deal with that issue later. Facing a trial and awaiting the outcome thereof can be a time of great anxiety, not just for the person who is charged but also, perhaps even more so, for family members or children of the accused person. They experience uncertainty in respect of what they can do with their life, and that can cause serious anxiety. Obviously, the victim needs to be dealt with in a fair and expedited manner, but family members also suffer, sometimes more so than anybody else. Although the Bill arises from criminal prosecutions, both civil and criminal justice systems seem to be under threat at present. We believe in a justice system that is fit for purpose and people need to have confidence they will receive justice in the courts without any extraordinary delay. I understand that some people on the call-over list in the Dublin Circuit Court in January and February of this year have been given trial dates of 2025. In my own time in the courts, this would have been an extraordinarily long period to wait. The picture outside Dublin is not much better. Some 66,000 court summonses are backlogged at present following delays caused by the pandemic, a lack of space for hearings and a shortage of judges. Dates for one-day hearings on the judicial review list, including judicial reviews, are now as late as February 2024. I accept that this is on the civil proceedings side of things. As was seen during the pandemic, some imagination needs to be utilised in the conduct of these trials. The challenges of people living in isolated and rural areas need to be recognised. There are 245 cases on the list for this Thursday in County Kerry. Three weeks have been set aside for Circuit Court sittings in May and a further three have been set aside for July. That is not going to make a huge impact on the list. If a person is charged today in County Kerry, it is unlikely that he or she will receive a date for hearing until at least 2025, even though there are cases on that list going back to 2018 and 2019. In Limerick Circuit Criminal Court, there are more than 200 cases on the indictable list, which are criminal cases. Having looked at the call-over list, numbers would indicate that those cases were returned to the District Court, again back as far as 2019. Victims of crime, clearly, are waiting years for cases to be heard and for justice to be heard. Some accused persons also have to spend years awaiting trial, often under onerous bail conditions. Where accused persons are in custody, they are given priority but they must still spend months or sometimes years awaiting trial. We all know how overcrowded the prisons are. In the Civil Circuit Court cases in Limerick, there is a backlog of about 1,000 cases. There is an exceptional delay also in some parts of the country in getting Circuit Family Court matters on for hearing. Even when a case is ready to be heard one could be left waiting a year to have the case dealt with. There is also a side issue in the drain of lawyers from family law cases because of various issues, including the rates of payment under the civil legal aid scheme. These cases affect mostly women and deal with domestic violence-type cases, and all of the resultant cases that arise. The underutilisation of the extensive new criminal court facility in Mulgrave Street in Limerick is unacceptable. Most days, at least half of the six courtrooms in the building are left idle. Yesterday and today, I understand that only four of the six courtrooms were in use. Both days have been particularly busy days. Complaints were made last year about the fact that the Central Criminal Court was not sitting enough in Limerick. This brought attention to the issue and the Central Criminal Court began sitting there, and did so for a number of months. I understand, however, that the  Will the Minister of State also provide some sort of a timeline for the proposed review of the Circuit Court and District Court areas, which was recommended by the working group? It is my view, which I am sure the Minister of State will share, that access to justice is an important concern and cutbacks must not be the determining factor. The Circuit and District court system can be burdensome and confusing so I welcome the move to modernise it. I am keen that spatial inequalities, especially, are corrected. The availability of quality judges is a concern also. I commend the Government for acting on the report of the working group on judicial resources, but unfortunately there is a risk that the report by the European Commission, which said Ireland is the worst country in Europe for judicial resourcing, has not been acted upon fully.

We know what it is like to be alone and vulnerable in a foreign country. Most people in Ireland are welcoming when an international protection applicant centre is opened in their area but it is a reality that a small minority are not. We have seen a clear and organised campaign by divisive elements that have been able, or are attempting, to exploit this. Ironically, for some of them who are supposedly Irish patriots, they are awfully keen on welcoming in agitators from abroad, copying their tactics and taking their lead. As we made clear in the past, no matter where it is, protesting outside people's homes, however temporary those homes, is not acceptable to us. If the protestors want to and are brave enough, they should go to Government Buildings or take their protests somewhere else, and not intimidate further people, including women and children, who have come here fleeing persecution abroad. The Government has repeatedly failed to devise a long-term plan. In its White Paper nearly two and a half years ago, it proposed a series of six or seven reception centres around the country, provided not, as my party would have liked, by Government so they could be used for other opportunities later but by approved housing bodies. However, not one of those has been delivered. We have heard a lot today from the Government about what has been done but the reality is the central tenets of its plan from two years ago have not been delivered on. A serious response was needed from the Government. It would have been more appropriate to have had a junior Minister with sole responsibility for this but it was interesting that another Green Party junior Minister, who already has responsibility for two other Departments, was appointed in this area when neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael was prepared to put its neck on the line.	spk_150

Approved housing body, AHB, housing, which would have meant own-door and stable accommodation to aid integration and supports, was not prioritised and was eventually shelved. We have seen successful integration models around the country, none more so than in Caherciveen in my county, where the level of integration, due no doubt to the hard work of local community activists, has been inspirational. There may now be a decrease in protection applicants arriving but the decision to end the provision of accommodation to applicants led directly to a dangerous incident on the streets of Dublin. We cannot separate the risks to international protection applicants from the risks to the public and the risks to members of An Garda Síochána. There were a number of developments last week in regard to the protests outside the accommodation centres and we can separate these out. Gardaí cannot be expected to pick up the pieces of a society which is broken by Government inaction. We have also heard many of the claims that we have not looked after our own but the reason for the increase is because of the 11,000 or 12,000 people who are homeless now. I knew people who were more than ten years in emergency accommodation, people who were in and out of the courts system and who were not able to get their lives back together. There has not been enough action on that and it is no wonder the response has been so poor.	spk_152

The Minister may recollect he stated funding was in place to recruit an additional 1,000 members, but that is incorrect. If the Taoiseach checked, he would see that only 288 people entered Templemore this year. He should do the maths on that. The Garda Representative Association, GRA, has stated that numbers are decreasing and members of the Garda are resigning. Many feel burnt out, demoralised and lacking in support. Other gardaí are reported as saying the Taoiseach's remarks demonstrated a lack of knowledge and that he was trying to deflect from the housing issue. The Taoiseach and members of the Garda are at odds. Does the Minister concede he will miss his recruitment target and after a decade of Fine Gael Ministers responsible for justice, will he put a plan in place to bring Garda numbers to safe levels for communities, gardaí and vulnerable people?	spk_139
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-05-17	dail	33	Central Statistics Office Sexual Violence Survey 2022: Statements	dbsect_10	"We welcome the CSO sexual violence survey. It is a sobering reminder of the importance of the third national strategy on DSGBV. The importance of a report such as this, based on diverse sources, cannot be overstated. The CSO is to be commended on the report which, despite its disturbing facts, is a welcome development. I was taken particularly by what the Minister, Deputy Harris, said about the statistics on the number of people who have been raped in this country, 18% of women and 3% of men. For so long, the biggest road block for victims has been the lack of reporting as well as being met with silence or disbelief or even denial. It came up a lot on the justice committee that we were dealing with a paucity of statistics compared to what they have in other jurisdictions. The lack of information led to a negative cycle of powerlessness, withdrawal and depression for so many victims. The colossal task of changing these attitudes is starting to progress. The survey is one more aspect of this. As politicians, we cannot claim now to be ignorant or in the dark about the scale and depth of the issue. It is worth exploring some of the headline figures to ensure they are on the record. The most obvious place to start is where the representatives from the Government started, with the fact that 52% of women reported experiencing sexual violence in their lifetime, with the figure being 28% for men. The fact that the majority of sexual abuse victims are women, and the majority of women have experienced sexual violence, demonstrates the gendered nature of violence in our society. Many women in recent years deserve praise for speaking out. There are many stories out there that we have not heard yet of defiance, strength and overcoming the odds. As legislators, it is our job to ensure that these obstacles to justice are removed and understanding the issue in full is the first step in this battle. While the majority of perpetrators of sexual violence are men, in my view we also need to hear more from and about the 28% of men who have experienced sexual violence, which is a not insignificant number. Abuse and suffering abuse are wrongfully associated with being weak or meek in some way and these are attributes not considered to be manly or macho. The report states that the 53% of women who experienced sexual violence in their lifetime were more likely to have told someone compared to men, at only 34%. Both figures need to change. We are often told a man should be strong and not show weakness but we have seen this begin to change. I give credit to the consent education campaign of the Department of Justice, which depicts men as victims as well as perpetrators. We need to end the idea that male victims could have stopped their own abuse or are somehow not deserving of justice. I know the Department will be working in the short term with one of the larger sporting agencies to promote a campaign. They have already dealt with one on combating racism. This is the next step which is coming shortly. I welcome that. As we build a better understanding of sexual violence, we need to ask how we can combat it. Better statistics on sexual violence must be our starting point. We currently lag significantly behind the United Kingdom when it comes to this. The gathering of data over there includes information on age, gender, ethnicity and so many other areas. I suspect that if we keep these data on a more regular basis, we will quickly learn the nature of sexual violence in the State and be in a better position to address it. It is worth noting that the DPP has asked for more resources for the gathering of data and NGOs have long been calling for it to be implemented.  The Istanbul Convention needs to be respected. The State's work in this area is currently under scrutiny by GREVIO, the independent expert body responsible for monitoring the implementation of the convention. A state visit has already been carried out and the report is due soon. It is hard to imagine that there will not be serious issues raised in the report, especially as we are working now only to cover multiple counties where there is poor or no provision of refuge space. I think there are nine counties out of the 26 in which there is no refuge space. I recently met with Catherine Casey from Adapt in Tralee. She says that they had 39 women or families admitted last year but space was refused to 29 separate women during that time. They need additional refuge spaces. While they are not currently on the priority list, I am agreeing with her call that Tralee should be included. On resourcing and delivery, as was mentioned by the Minister and the Minister of State earlier, the third national strategy on DSGBV is most important including for the creation of material to reach migrant communities. The third strategy must press for the rights of migrant women, who are often outside of the loop. Within the courts and judicial system, much work also needs to be completed. The Minister, Deputy Harris, laid out the importance of preventing defendants who are lay litigants from cross-examining vulnerable victims. We want to avoid further traumatisation while at the same time protecting constitutional rights for a fair trial. As the Minister said, it is a huge piece of work around the change in attitudes. A National Women's Council report completed on behalf of the Department of Justice outlined the scale of the challenges. This document, A Report on the Intersection of the Criminal Justice, Private Family Law and Public Law Child Care Processes in Relation to Domestic and Sexual Violence"", had clear conclusions. It is worth quoting from it:One act or a series of acts of domestic or sexual violence can cause the activation of two and sometimes three distinct legal processes - the criminal justice process, the private family law process and the public law child care process - involving the same victim or victims and the same alleged perpetrator. While there is a very real factual overlap between all of those processes, legally these processes work more or less in isolation, despite the potential for real and beneficial liaison. Victims suffer as a result of this lack of collaboration between the various processes as vital information, which could serve to secure just outcomes, is sometimes lost in the 'gaps' between the three systems. I recently met with the Offaly group dealing with women who have suffered violence. There is a big issue accessing solicitors. Many solicitors are leaving the area and they need to be funded better to prevent this happening. On foot of the O'Malley review of the treatment of vulnerable witnesses and the victim's journey policy, both focused on criminal proceedings, the report I mentioned previously is a reminder that DSGBV is very complex. There is a serious problem with victims being respected and believed across the board and this must change. I also want to speak briefly about pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill. Witnesses want an inter-agency, whole-of-government report and support the insertion of a clause to give the agency the powers to compel other agencies to collaborate towards this. I will defer to my colleagues."	spk_195

There have also been revelations regarding prison conditions and overcrowding with more than 200 prisoners sleeping on mattresses. In a similar vein, last August, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions wrote to the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform telling him that its resources were stretched, that there was significant underfunding in attempting to deal with the increasing caseload, including financial corruption cases, and that there was a danger that prosecutions could be compromised.

Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-04-26	dail	33	Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill 2022: Report and Final Stages	dbsect_20	I will speak on amendment No. 10 in this grouping on public order offences. When we consider these amendments, and No. 10 in particular, we should bear in mind that under section 20, the hatred shown against persons on account of their particular characteristics can be used as an aggravating factor in sentencing for certain offences which will include these public order type offences. While of course we are against hate crime and that is a given, having spoken to some criminal law practitioners and having had some experience of it myself over the years, there can often be a situation where there are two of them in it. There could be a situation where there are insults, threats or intimidation or something under section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, such as threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or being reckless as to whether a breach of the peace would occur.When considering that, we also have to consider the proportionality of an offence. For example, under section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, it is triable and is summarily only in the District Court. The maximum penalty is still three months and there is a very low threshold. The danger is that if somebody is convicted in a situation where insults could have been thrown on both sides, but some are protected characteristics and others are not, then two people could be charged arising from the same incident. One person could be charged with a regular public order offence and the other person, who may or may not have started the row, could be charged with a hate crime. They could both be convicted, of course, but one would be convicted of a hate crime. It would be disproportionate to leave somebody with a conviction for that arising from a public order offence because of the difficulties that would subsequently arise for that person. That is also referenced in the academic paper by academics from University of Limerick, UL, which was mentioned by Deputy Paul Murphy. One may try to get through Garda vetting to obtain a job, despite it essentially being a public order offence. This could take place in various different circumstances. It relies on an understanding or a mild promise that the Director of Public Prosecutions would not bring something forward unless they felt it was merited. We are the legislators and if we have concerns about a public order offence becoming a hate crime, it should be stated now. I support Deputy Paul Murphy, particularly in relation to amendment No. 10.	spk_295
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-04-25	dail	33	Collection and Transfer of Advance Passenger Information: Motion	dbsect_18	"I thank the Minister of State for his presentation. As he said, this proposal is for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime. The 2004 directive is to be repealed and replaced by two different regulations. There is, as was outlined in the briefing document, a close connection between this regulation and the regulation on collection and transfer of API data for facilitating external border controls. As the Minister of State outlined, because Oireachtas approval is required, that has to be done prior to, I think, 6 May. It is important to note that the regulation aims to lay down better rules for the collection of the data and to ensure that compliance is, as can be seen, carefully limited in scope and contains strict personal data limits and safeguards. It is important also that it must be selective and cannot be systematic unless justified by genuine and present or foreseeable terrorist threat. While there are always civil liberties concerns about these databases, their use is important in combating the work of transnational gangs. The breakup of the so-called super cartel is ongoing and very important. Co-operation of multiple countries to combat this entity, which does not function in a manner that can be understood as a strict hierarchy, has been crucial. I note that Europol said recently that 49 suspects were arrested during Operation Desert Light, with a series of raids which took place across Europe and the UAE between 8 November and 9 November last. Those arrests were a culmination of parallel investigations in a number of countries with co-operation from An Garda Síochána also. Europol said that forces involved in the operation targeted both the command-and-control centre and the logistical drugs trafficking infrastructure in Europe. Thirty tonnes of drugs were seized by officers. If I may quote Europol:The scale of cocaine importation into Europe under the suspects' control and command was massive and over 30 tonnes ... were seized by law enforcement over the course of the investigations.The use of encrypted phones was a feature of this case also, demonstrating the technological sophistication of many of these gangs. The usual caveats of ongoing investigations must be repeated, but it is interesting that media reports indicate that the search for a safe haven by some leaders of this super cartel is getting increasingly desperate. Being able to move and conduct their business is absolutely critical to these gangs, and it is interesting that today the Commissioner, speaking at the conference of the Garda Representative Association, GRA, issued a warning. He has our support in the Garda's pursuit of criminal gangs. It is worthwhile to note the need for this revised proposal, which replaces the previous EU measures. The PNR directive, which was adopted in 2016, allowed police and justice officials to access passenger data on flights to and from the EU in order to combat serious crimes and maintain security within the EU. Then there was a case taken in the Belgian courts by human rights groups challenging the data recorded under the previous Council directive. According to Reuters, the Belgian courts referred the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union. ""The Court considers"", it said, ""that respect for fundamental rights requires that the powers provided for by the PNR Directive be limited to what is strictly necessary."" The court held that the PNR must be limited to terrorist offences and serious crime having an objective link, even if only indirect, with the carriage of passengers in the air. The court said that the extension of the PNR to intra-EU flights should be allowed only if it is strictly necessary and open to review by a court or independent administrative body. Again, to quote from the decision:In the absence of a genuine and present or foreseeable terrorist threat to a Member State, EU law precludes national legislation providing for the transfer and processing of the ... data of intra-EU flights and transport operations carried out by other means within the European Union. The court also said that artificial intelligence technology and self-learning systems may not be used in collecting airline passenger data. This is an important aspect of the decision, and we need to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to the application of AI, machine learning and other technological innovations. There are, of course, a number of risks inherent with some of those tools. The first is the risk to our civil liberties and of overreach. One former officer, when commenting on the PRISM revelations by Edward Snowden, was quick to point out that it was far more invasive than what they had managed to maintain. Databases that collect information must be carefully supervised and dispose of data within a set timeframe, and their use must be proportionate to their purpose. The decision of the court recognises this, and it is important that that case law is respected. The second risk is the impact on policing work, whereby the use of these tools can distort how cases are looked into and resolved. There can be such a thing as too much information, and training in investigative techniques needs to keep pace with technology. The third risk which needs to be mitigated is the need for legal certainty. Where poor laws are passed, there is an opportunity for some to challenge those cases when the law is unconstitutional or in breach of fundamental rights. Finally, I wish to speak to some of the details of the proposal. The fact that the proposal is carefully limited and contains strict personal data protection limits and safeguards is a positive. I trust we will not see overreach as a result. Air carriers are being given clear direction on what to maintain and, as the Minister of State outlined, there is a proposed central router that will act as the single point of reception and onward distribution, replacing the current system comprised of multiple connections between the air carriers and national authorities. Overall, we support this motion and hope that the important work of co-operation against crime will continue."	spk_253
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-04-25	dail	33	Re-introduction of Mortgage Interest Relief: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_21	The need for this motion to pass and for mortgage interest relief to be granted is clear because evictions, repossessions and mortgage arrears are all on the rise in Kerry, as they are across the State. County Kerry has a very high level of relative deprivation. Employment is often seasonal, part-time and low paid. Homeowners in the county are particularly susceptible to interest rate increases and rising household costs more generally. The recent revelation - this is not a joke - that exactly one affordable home was built in the county last year is a damning indictment of how the county is being served by the Government and its housing policy. Housing lists are long - up to 14 years - affordable homes are few and far between and the cost-of-living crisis is forcing those with mortgages on their homes into even greater precariousness. The main reason for this cost-of-living crisis is, of course, rising energy prices. Whether paying for energy directly or for goods that are subject to higher energy costs, workers and families are being squeezed. In this context, I want to outline some facts from the recent Household Energy Price Index study commissioned by the Austrian and Hungarian energy regulators. The study found that Ireland was the most expensive of 33 countries surveyed. That includes the EU, UK and Ukraine. Financial supports  Households are at breaking point and need whatever assistance they can get. Mortgage interest relief is only one part of the picture but it is an important measure nonetheless.	spk_269
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-04-20	dail	33	Organised Crime: Statements	dbsect_33	It is a reality in this State that crime and antisocial behaviour disproportionately affect communities with high deprivation and those where economic opportunities are most scarce. It is the decent, hard-working people who live in these communities who bear the brunt of the failure of successive Governments to bring criminals and organised gangs to justice. I realise these statements are on organised crime but let us consider for a comment the impact on some communities. Apart from the fact that they must deal with antisocial behaviour and drug-related violence, there are up to 15,000 heroin users in Dublin alone, with one drug advisory and treatment centre. Between 2004 and 2017, there were 8,995 drug-related deaths in this State, the highest rate of deaths between the ages of 16 and 64 in Europe. In Ireland, there are nearly 20,000 opiate users, many of whom are living chaotic, hopeless lives around this city centre, within a mile or two of this building. Speaking not just as a Sinn Féin Deputy but also as someone with some experience of the workings of the criminal justice system, I know the Garda and the courts are, as matters stand, ill equipped to tackle the scourge of crime and the impact of drug-related crime in our communities. There are several gaping holes when it comes to our defences against organised crime. The first and most glaring concerns the resources afforded to An Garda Síochána. Garda retention and recruitment are in a state of crisis. With Garda numbers consistently hovering around 14,500 for the past decade, the number of officers  Gardaí have my full support. Having spoken to some of them recently, I learned they feel badly let down by the failure of the current and previous Governments to give them the support and leadership they need to get on with their jobs. One garda felt no one has the back of gardaí any more. These issues have been well flagged, of course. Year after year, we see big Garda recruitment numbers announced at budget time but what is never said is that these targets are not met. The first thing Sinn Féin would do to address this situation would be to initiate a large Garda recruitment drive – one of the largest in the history of the State – with the goal of reaching 1,600 Garda recruits every year. Gardaí tell me the target of 1,000 additional gardaí this year will not be met. There are simply not enough trainees in Templemore. There have not been enough in the first three months of this year in any event. That is the scale of the ambition we require. We want to have a Minister for Justice who delivers on that because it is what our communities need and deserve. We can do it by introducing a hybrid training model for new gardaí that would see recruits train in Templemore and local Garda stations. This would boost capacity and ensure under-recruitment finally ends. It would also increase the Garda presence in the areas that need to see officers out in local communities and help gardaí to eliminate the fear of crime as well as eliminate crime and its causes. The reality of 21st-century organised crime is that more technical experts, including cyber experts, are needed to serve in specialist units within the Garda. The recruitment of people with these skills must be a priority. We need to engage with the Garda to identify and address the challenges in recruitment to ensure the best people are recruited for the jobs and can stay in the organisation to build on their experience. The failure to establish a dedicated Garda public transport unit is a major black mark on this Government's record. The disgraceful scenes we see on public transport have no place in our society. They must be stamped out. I fully support the establishment of a dedicated unit. The ongoing discussions around Garda rosters must be addressed and a survey of members must be conducted to help to address retention issues. That this has not been completed is a testament to the Government's inability to plan and address problems before they become crises. We see this in housing and health, and we also see it in policing. It is not good enough. Along with having more gardaí on the front line, An Garda Síochána and the courts must have all the powers they need to dismantle criminal gangs and criminal networks. Criminal proceeds are laundered, and banks and other institutions play a role in facilitating this. Since this Government came into office in 2020, it has failed to enact legislative measures to deal with this reality in a timely and speedy fashion. Bills on counterfeiting and money laundering were delayed, including through breaking EU-mandated implementation deadlines. This is unacceptable. Gangs have become increasingly sophisticated, and some of them work in co-operation rather than in competition with each other. The more pressure that is placed on these gangs, the better in order to break them up and ensure they are eradicated. That requires safe levels of gardaí on our streets and gardaí with the resources they need to police the criminals. Courts must be equipped to prosecute them. In 2021, Sinn Féin introduced the Proceeds of Crime (Investment in Disadvantaged Communities) Bill, which allows for the reinvestment of CAB seizures into the communities most affected by organised crime, in order to alleviate the impact of organised crime and drug use in those areas. This would tackle the root causes and prevent young people from being lured into a life of criminality. Our courts, too, need to have all the powers and resources they need to fight 21st-century criminals.  Every year, Fine Gael makes a virtue of renewing 50-year-old legislation, when everyone accepts this is an outdated means of dealing with the criminals of 2023. I commend Deputy Martin Kenny and the Minister for Justice in the previous Administration, Charlie Flanagan, for ensuring that a review of these laws is finally initiated. There is an ongoing review due to report soon to update laws in this regard that the Taoiseach said on Tuesday will report soon. We anticipate that its recommendations will include modernisation and we expect to support the new legislation that will recommend dismantling criminal gangs robustly. That is what is needed because despite the rhetoric, and we have heard plenty of it here today, people tell us that this Government is hard on An Garda Síochána and soft on crime. This has left communities at the mercy of criminals and antisocial behaviour. These communities are wary about walking the streets at night, are terrified in their own homes, fear for their families’ safety and feel unsafe and abandoned. Under this Government, An Garda Síochána is underfunded and overstretched. Under a Sinn Féin Government, that will change. We will recruit the gardaí we need, give them the powers they require and give the courts the means to put criminals where they belong by taking them off our streets and putting them in jail. We will ensure that communities can feel safe and protected, as they deserve.	spk_388

Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-04-19	dail	33	European Union Directive: Motion	dbsect_12	As was stated, this proposal builds on the original anti-trafficking directive from 2011. It will hopefully help to strengthen the ability of the EU to combat human trafficking-related crimes and give stronger tools for law enforcement to investigate and prosecute. On that basis, Sinn Féin will support the passage of this proposal and we look forward to further progress in implementation. I acknowledge what the Minister of State said about Article 7 and the cross-referencing and tweaks that may have to be made to it. Trafficking is ultimately a criminal economic market and, as the Minister of State said, it is an exploitative crime which destroys lives. With demand in Europe for immigration and asylum from the global south higher than ever, we cannot ignore these realities. It is notable, as was outlined in a recent article in the Associated Press, the traditional route from north Africa across to Europe has now been securitised so much that alternative routes are now being used. We saw with the Frontex issue that this has not always been done in accordance with international and domestic law. We agree that while the official figures may indicate there are 7,000 trafficked persons, there are probably many more than that. The net effect of all the trafficking is that, according to the Associated Press article, the crossing routes are even more dangerous. Routes around the western coast of Morocco and towards the Canary Islands are being attempted. This has meant, as Deputies will know, that boats are washing up as far away as the Caribbean, with all aboard having been killed at sea. Desperate for work or to be united with family, many are falling into the hands of unscrupulous traffickers who often abandon or let down the vulnerable migrants. Along with the legal solutions contained in this proposal, Europe needs to recognise the economic and social routes of migration and deal with them accordingly. Until this is done, and Ireland is well-placed to provide moral leadership on this, we will keep seeing tragedies unfold. With regard to Ireland's policies, the US State Department produced an excellent report on trafficking in 2022 which placed Ireland in the group of tier B nations with respect to anti-trafficking. According to the report, the prevalence of human trafficking in Ireland is likely to be higher than official statistics report. A comprehensive 2021 study found that from 2014 to 2019, the true number of trafficking victims was likely to have been 38% higher than official national statistics. This is extremely worrying. Both detection and enforcement also seem to be lacking. According to the findings of the US report, Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, inspectors reportedly found several violations of employment and labour law in the fishing sector and referred several employers for prosecution but it did not report law enforcement actions against any companies for labour trafficking in 2021. My county has one of the longest coastlines in the country and is a prime site for potential trafficking. When laws were debated in this area previously, the House was informed of a HSE team working with trafficking victims. I would be interested to hear more about this team and its work around the State, particularly on the western coast. I note that some negotiations are ongoing on this proposal. Will the Minister of State explain how much of this is connected with the Border, the common travel area and Brexit? I ask him to get back to me on that after the debate. The State has some way to go and perhaps the harmonisation proposals contained here will assist. It is notable that the EU is seeking, as the Minister of State said, to harmonise co-operation more and more because crime is increasingly transnational. By definition, trafficking is international in nature and is, therefore, a good candidate for such proposals. Some social networks have been used for trafficking and Europe needs to stand up to the tech companies enabling this trade. We welcome the ideas included in the amended directive which specifically refer to offences committed or facilitated through information and communication technologies, including the Internet and social media, as well as the other proposals in relation to mandatory sanctions for legal persons and a formal national referral mechanism which will improve early identification and referral for assistance and support of victims. That will create the basis for a European referral mechanism. We also welcome the stepping up of demand reduction by making it a criminal offence for people who knowingly use the services provided by victims of trafficking and the EU-wide data collection which helps in so many other ways. The proposal is welcome insofar as it addresses the wide range of trafficking offences. We have spoken about the covert crossings but also many victims of trafficking enter through commercial air and sea routes. They often do so with the assistance of traffickers and, as noted in the US State Department report, this is done with the promise of legitimate employment and visas, or through some other types of scams. Once people arrive here, they are forced into what is basically indentured work or slavery in beauty salons or maybe in sex work.  As I mentioned, the proposals refer to possible criminalisation of those knowingly using the services provided by the victims. With industries such as sex work, as well as forced marriages and illegal adoptions, to which the Minister of State also referred, involved, An Garda Síochána will have to recruit from, and work with, diverse communities of migrants. It may be that the Garda is having difficulties increasing its numbers but there is potential to increase them by doing more recruiting from those communities. More emphasis needs to be placed on this and credit must go to the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, who is personally very conscious of this need. Overall, Sinn Féin supports the passing of the motion and we look forward to further progress in implementing the proposal.	spk_185
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-04-19	dail	33	Courts Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_13	I thank the Minister of State for his presentation. There is no doubt but that this Bill is welcome. We had called for additional judges because from speaking to practitioners, guards and many others, it is a significant issue. In the Dublin Circuit Court, for example, trial dates for February and March 2025 were given out earlier this year. The only exception would be if a child was involved or if the accused was in custody. In the Central Criminal Court, trial dates have varied. In severe cases, judges have tried to assign a date within nine months and to use case management, but in other cases, there are delays of 15 to 18 months from when a case enters the list. That is clearly not acceptable to anyone. The judicial review list on the civil side of the High Court is very slow. It might take 12 months to get a hearing date for a one- or two-day case. Once the case is heard, the judge could take weeks or months to deliver judgment because there is practically no time available to him or her out of court to write a judgment. I heard the proposals of the Minister of State.Sometimes it sounds like a great idea to have judges in the Circuit Court sitting every day of the week. In practice that may or may not be a good idea. If it is to be considered I am sure that everything will be taken in the round. Proposals will be considered about restructuring the District Court and reviewing Circuit Court geographical areas. I would guard against too much centralisation. There is the old maxim of justice being done and being seen to be done; it should be seen to be done out in the communities also. A witness to a road traffic accident in Castlemaine, County Kerry, who is asked to go to court to be a witness in that case will have a round trip of about 100 km to go to Cahersiveen District Court to give evidence in that case because other closer courts such as the courts in Killorglin and Castleisland have been closed down. During my relatively short time in the courts around Kerry, about ten different District Court sittings were closed. Castleisland court was closed when Kerry County Council built a specific courthouse building for use by the Courts Service, a building which now houses water services. However, it was completely ignored and all of the services were sent to Tralee and in the overall budget buttons were saved. However, all the extra Castleisland cases put into Tralee are adding to the already long list in that court. It might seem like a great cost-saving measure in closing one court, but the overall benefit is not good. We do not want judges with very long lists. The stress of dealing with a long list of hearings is not beneficial. The Bill stems from the important report of the judicial planning working group. The Courts Service has been struggling severely for some time, as I have indicated. The pandemic exposed these struggles also. For years the justice system has been deprived of the resources and investment it needs. Many victims and ordinary plaintiffs have been forced to wait for long periods as the courts struggle to keep on top of caseloads. At the weekend I attended a conference on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Many of the workers in the midlands and around Athlone stressed the difficulty and the delays for vulnerable women in accessing justice in the courts. Maybe we can learn from what happened in England where, for example, cases for maintenance are sent to a different type of tribunal outside of the court system. There have also been some difficulties over there with that system and complaints about it. However, we can learn from what happened there rather than having massive lists of family cases. It is significant that the Government has to bring forward this legislation which entitles those affected by delays in criminal trials to compensation. This is at the instigation of the Council of Europe. It is significant that international obligations seem to be steering policy in this area more than an inherent sense of doing the right thing. Justice delayed is justice denied. It is worrying that the delays are down to how the courts have been resourced and operated. One of the European Commissioners appeared in Leinster House a few months ago berating Ireland in a Commission report over the number of judges per head of population. Delays in many areas of law, especially family cases, are becoming intolerable. Wait times of up to 24 months are not unheard of and that can be a lifetime for vulnerable people. The European Commission report, as I mentioned, ranked Ireland as the worst country in Europe for judicial resourcing. Its report stated that we had 3.27 judges per 100,000 people in 2020, which is way below the European average of 17.6 judges. This obviously has real impacts on access to justice for ordinary people. It also has an impact on economic competitiveness. Sectors such as technology and financial services make up a large part of our economy now and legal services are incredibly important to ensure the smooth functioning of the economy. Of course, the Bill is a step in the right direction and we will be supporting it. However, the increase, while in line with the recommendation of the working group, will still leave us below the European average in respect of judges  It is worth looking at other aspects of the report which are not necessarily included in the Bill and placing them on the record here so that the Government is held to account. An OECD study was commissioned specifically to inform the report and it found the judicial system has shortfalls along with limited efficiency of court operations and case management capacity. It suggests the likely number needed was between certain points in that range in respect of total numbers between 361 and 108 extra judges. The Minister of State has indicated that there are appointments, but they are only one part of the picture. We look forward to a more detailed roadmap and I think he has outlined the initial proposals for 2023 and for next year. As the Minister of State indicated in his opening statement, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, the establishment of the environment and planning court and family court will also be considered. We may need more regulatory impact assessments when it comes to introducing Bills in the future as the number of required judges and their skill sets will be shaped by developments such as the one the report mentions. A phased recruitment of judges is also welcomed, as is actual physical capacity and available supports that are in short supply in many locations often due to the fact that many courts, especially in rural areas, have been closed. I will quote from one of the reports about the five-day working week as a standard across jurisdictions, greater powers in support for court presidents and better data to support it in the District Court and Circuit Court areas. This needs to be married with the independence of the courts which are run by judges as they see fit. The review of Circuit Court and District Court areas must bear in mind access to justice for isolated rural areas. Kerry has three peninsulas and a high degree of peripherality. I have frequently mentioned the issue of Tralee courthouse. The proposal is still to close the current courthouse, which has been there since the days of Daniel O'Connell, and to build a new one. The Courts Service completely ruled out any other proposals to use the existing building, which would have been better for a number of reasons, not least to keep the services where people are used to them being, helping the whole of the town centre to improve itself and even the carbon footprint in constructing a new courthouse. I am not sure if the transfer from Kerry County Council to the Courts Service has gone through yet. I do not think it is too late to review and revise that decision, to talk to neighbouring landowners such as An Post to keep a proper court service on Ash Street in the middle of the town where it has been for 170 years, since it was constructed from a quarry in the centre of town. However, the Courts Service had plans for all the different towns around the country and it seems that the easy option has been taken to use the brownfield site.	spk_192

We need a plan to deal with the deer and wild goats, from which practically every sapling in the national park is under threat, and we need a proper 15-year plan to finally eliminate rhododendron.

We will be allowing this motion to pass, but after the time I have spent in this House, there is a certain sense of  We ourselves are also faced with a huge problem due to Brexit and the lack of final status agreement in many areas. Criminal networks now operate on a transnational basis and the need for co-operation between North and South, as well as east and west, is paramount. Throughout Brexit, the Garda and the PSNI have continued to work well together despite challenges. I commend both bodies on this and note there have been a number of reforms recently in regard to accountability and civilian control within the Twenty-six Counties, so the police services are becoming more aligned and that may continue. In terms of the detail of what is required, the proposal refers to Article 3 of Protocol 21 of the annex to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU. The protocol governs the participation of Ireland and the UK in measures relating to freedom, justice and security. Scrutiny over EU measures is an important part of the democratic process, especially in this area. Given some EU members are adopting worrying positions in respect of minority rights and judicial independence, we cannot always be certain this is an area where we will always agree with our EU colleagues, and definitely not with the Israeli Government. Notwithstanding this, mutual co-operation is still important and consists of a variety of mechanisms whereby assistance in regard to criminal investigations or proceedings may be provided by one state to another. It is worth consulting the wording of the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA. Article 365 of the TCA provides for three things, namely, that the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation shall undertake that requests of mutual assistance will be made using a standard form and that the committee may amend the standard form as may be necessary. Legal and operational certainty is important and the form will assist with this.I do not pretend to be  While we are dealing with protocols, I welcome reports in the media last week that An Garda Síochána has agreed new protocols in respect of evictions.

I have heard some TDs saying that some tenants will require four years' notice and that the State would come in and issue compulsorily purchase orders, CPOs, on all of these houses. Whether they were concerned with voting to extend the ban or to retain it, there were some strange attempts to divorce themselves from the consequence of their own actions and they attacked Sinn Féin to distract from these consequences. One hundred and twenty eviction notices will fall due in County Kerry unless our measure is passed. There is little room for prevarication now when the stakes are so high for so many. Speaking to housing officers in Kerry County Council, I hear that the system is already under immense strain. They are under severe pressure and it is like organised chaos. In my office, my team has heard a number of concerning stories already in Kerry with the ban set to expire. We had contact from one mother of four children who was told that she had to leave by her landlord. She had no options and is terrified that she will end up homeless. Once that happens, it is difficult to see a path back to stable housing for her so long as current Government policies continue. A woman in her 80s was in touch with my office. She was given notice a while back now but with the increased competition for housing and rent prices, she has nowhere to go. These stories will keep on coming over the next few weeks and months. There has not been a single affordable house built in County Kerry in the past few years and there were 56 adults accessing homeless accommodation in January of this year. On the scheme that was introduced last year, no communication was made to Kerry County Council. When they complained about it, the Taoiseach said that it was a cop-out by Kerry County Council. Without the guidance or management from Central Government, none of the rented accommodation was purchased. The length of time for conveyances did not seem to be taken into account at all. These figures might seem relatively small but for a rural and isolated county with little resources, the 120 eviction notices, representing probably at least three times the current number of people homeless, represents a huge challenge. When those on HAP or direct provision but eligible to leave are included, the figures are even higher. In a market where upward pressure is so high, the reality is that the single mothers, the elderly, migrants, disabled and those least able to absorb rent increases will miss out. It will see them filling up emergency accommodation unless the measure passes. There is no getting away from it. I repeat my call for all Kerry TDs to support this legislation.	spk_237
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-03-22	dail	33	Reform of Carer's Allowance Scheme: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I also commend Deputy Harkin and the Independent Group for tabling this motion. It is very comprehensive and covers a lot of ground. Over the past two or three weeks in particular, I have had to deal with a number of cases where family members' loved ones who are in community hospitals or the general hospital are coming home and require care. In some cases, they have a certain amount of care already but they need an extra person, an extra carer, to help out where, for example, there might be a hoist in use and two people are needed to operate it. I pay tribute to and thank the home care teams in Kerry for their assistance, particularly those in the Tralee and Listowel offices who deal with our requests in a very straightforward and speedy manner. In Kerry there is a growing crisis within the sector. There is much concern at the growing waiting list for home care assistance in the CHO 4 area, which includes Kerry. Sobering figures were published as part of the Home and Community Care Ireland, HCCI, new quarterly report known as the HCCI Home Care Data Series. According to that report, 404 people in Kerry were waiting for home care support at the end of 2022, up 94% on the figures for the same period in 2021. This translates into families under pressure and stress, having to put their lives on hold and into those being cared for having to ask friends, neighbours or other loved ones to be there for them when they are getting up in the morning, to help the care assistant. More help is needed. The figures for the rest of the CHO 4 area show that Kerry has some of the worst wait times of any region in the State.  There is some positive news as waiting lists for approved funding have reduced. However, funding is only one part of the picture and many areas have funds in place but people are either not able to get a carer or not able to get more hours when they require them. As my colleague Deputy Carthy said, people have to negotiate all of the stepping stones involved with means tests and making an application for carer's allowance. These additional elements of bureaucracy are difficult for them to deal with in an already stressful situation. Home care is vital to preserve the independence and dignity of the elderly. Without it, many can end up in nursing home settings when they could be cared for where they want to be, which is at home. Home care also has a role to play in ensuring that our hospitals, about which we have heard so much recently, are not overcrowded. The solutions are relatively simple and they must be tackled. Training, recruitment and retention must be improved and a pay agreement within the sector must be struck. Over the last few years, a lot of home care assistant provision was outsourced. A recruitment campaign has started but more effort needs to be put into directly employing home care assistants in the future and paying them properly for the great work they do in the community. A commission on care must be established and proper workforce planning undertaken. Without these changes, the waiting lists are going to grow and the State is going to end up picking up the tab, one way or another. These measures must be put in place to provide dignity and a decent quality of life for the people who have given so much to families and the State over the years.	spk_32

Téann a lán daoine gach bliain, nó gach seachtain, ag iarraidh freagraí dá ngearán leighis. Faigheann siad endoscopies agus colonoscopies chun freagraí a fháil dóibh féin. Sna laethanta roimh na mion-obráidí seo, b’éigean dóibh troscadh a dhéanamh agus beagáinín leighis nó cógais a thógáil. Many patients seeking answers for medical difficulties are sent for an endoscopy or a colonoscopy. Sometimes it could be for ulcers, flux or blockages, and sometimes pre-cancerous lesions or ulcers can be found with an endoscopy or colonoscopy. A person may have an inflamed bowel, colitis or pre-cancerous polyps. It can be very stressful for patients when they are trying to find this out. In advance of the procedure, they usually receive a prescription in the post for the preparatory medication such as Picolax or Klean-Prep. Some people say the cost of these is not huge, but nonetheless they can vary between €20 and up to €50. Different pharmacies charge different prices. It has come to my attention in recent weeks that these costs should be covered under the medical card scheme. It seems, however, they are joining an increasing list of medications prescribed or actions carried out by GPs for which patients are expected or asked to pay despite qualifying for a medical card.

We all have jobs to do from here on in, the first of which will be to engage with doctors who are prescribing these medications in order to ensure that if other medications are on the list, people, particularly medical card patients, will be directed to those ones. We must also engage with the companies if there is an easy fix in the context of them getting on the list. I have come across cases where it perhaps suited companies not to be on a particular list. However, we will certainly be able to take that up with them because prescription charges are essentially a tax on ill health.

Sometimes if people are waiting for answers, particularly if there is suspicion there may be cancer or a precancerous condition involved, it is certainly something that should be dealt with at the point of access. We have recognised this tax on ill health in our manifesto. We feel it is easy to identify who needs a medical card and why they are entitled to one. On a more general level, we should push forward with the Sláintecare recommendations to give medical cards to members of the Defence Forces who have to leave due to medical conditions and to all cancer patients.

Téann a lán daoine gach bliain, nó gach seachtain, ag iarraidh freagraí dá ngearán leighis. Faigheann siad endoscopies agus colonoscopies chun freagraí a fháil dóibh féin. Sna laethanta roimh na mion-obráidí seo, b’éigean dóibh troscadh a dhéanamh agus beagáinín leighis nó cógais a thógáil. Many patients seeking answers for medical difficulties are sent for an endoscopy or a colonoscopy. Sometimes it could be for ulcers, flux or blockages, and sometimes pre-cancerous lesions or ulcers can be found with an endoscopy or colonoscopy. A person may have an inflamed bowel, colitis or pre-cancerous polyps. It can be very stressful for patients when they are trying to find this out. In advance of the procedure, they usually receive a prescription in the post for the preparatory medication such as Picolax or Klean-Prep. Some people say the cost of these is not huge, but nonetheless they can vary between €20 and up to €50. Different pharmacies charge different prices. It has come to my attention in recent weeks that these costs should be covered under the medical card scheme. It seems, however, they are joining an increasing list of medications prescribed or actions carried out by GPs for which patients are expected or asked to pay despite qualifying for a medical card. There was one woman in her 70s who informed our office she had asked her doctor to postpone the appointment for a few weeks because she needed to save up the money for the pre-procedure medication. Over recent years we have seen charges for blood tests becoming common. Many GP practices are now being purchased by larger medical groups, which would be run on a for-profit basis.

Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-03-07	dail	33	High Energy Costs: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_14	The impact of the energy crisis in my constituency in County Kerry has been far reaching. Average gas and electricity prices have doubled in the past two years. The number of households in energy poverty has increased by 29% and all the time, the Government refused to reduce and cap energy prices, or introduce the windfall tax. The result has been that older people are in the dark; families are checking how much they eat in a week in order to keep the lights on and businesses face bills that tripled or quadrupled constantly. Cafés and restaurants, some of which have been in operation for 20 or 30 years, have had to close. Something has to give. While the worst of this winter may have passed, there is no guarantee that energy prices will come down. The St. Vincent de Paul report with regard to energy poverty was mentioned. More than 1,400 calls for help, per week, were made to St. Vincent de Paul in counties Cork and Kerry last December. This was an increase of 30% on the figures in the run-up to Christmas 2021 and, according to a report in the  Businesses were also suffering. Ballybunion health and leisure centre had to cut back on services, due to the high bills it was receiving, and was ineligible for support under the TBESS. The renewal of that scheme is incredibly important, because it showed how out of touch the Government was, in that businesses which did not work off the mains were not included in the scheme. I have two bills in front of me. One of them was received by the Tralee community development project. The group deals with women's groups and mental health organisations. Its bill in January and February 2022 was €3,917, for the use of 17,000 units of electricity, but in January and February 2023, the bill was €6,623 for 6,000 units fewer. The meals-on-wheels system in Tralee is supposed to move into the building, but that is under severe threat, because of the massive increase in its energy bills. The reducing and capping of June 2021 prices has not happened. It should happen. I call on the Minister of State to help the businesses and people of County Kerry.	spk_235
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-03-02	dail	33	Employment Equality (Pay Transparency) Bill 2022: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_42	"I move: ""That the Bill be now read a Second Time.""A couple of years ago a good old friend and colleague came to me with a story of her friend, Mike. He had got first class honours as a mature student when he returned to college and a job came up in Dublin, to where he travelled, at his own expense, only to discover when he arrived for the interview that the rates of pay would be far less than he anticipated. We got to work on this, and I would like to thank Lee Daly in my office, and the staff in the Bill's Office for their assistance in moving this Bill forward. I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, as well. I presume this Bill will go on to Committee Stage and I understand that it will receive a favourable response from the Minister. I await the analysis of the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers with great interest as the Bill is a simple solution to a real-world problem. This Bill will amend the Employment Equality Act 1998 to provide for pay transparency in the advertising of jobs. Section 10(1) of the 1998 Act prohibits the advertisement of any job where it indicates an intention to discriminate or might reasonably be understood as indicating such an intention. This Bill will add another ground for prohibition of a job advertisement, that is, the omission of pay scales. The basis of most discrimination is economic in nature and it must be combatted with economic solutions which empower people to combat inequality. Minorities and others do not need mere moral support, although that helps. They need real solutions and I hope this Bill is a small contribution towards making that happen. I am grateful for the engagements which I and my office had with the trade union sector. The Financial Services Union, in particular, was proactive in reaching out and sharing details of its research. According to its research, in 2018 there was a gap of €26,000 between males and females within the financial services, insurance and real estate industries. I am grateful to the Financial Services Union for offering its support and roadmap for action and its gender pay gap report should be examined by Government. Point 1 of this roadmap was to make pay rates transparent so I am glad the Bill will seek to implement this. In addition to discrimination on the grounds of gender, there are many other reasons this measure is important. An Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report in January of this year stated that migrant workers are paid as much as 40% less than their Irish counterparts. The problem affects lower paid and manual professions most and for every €1 an Irish worker earned, a non-Irish worker earned 78 cent. Especially disadvantaged were nationals from eastern Europe, Africa and the rest of the world. Some groups fare better than Irish nationals. For example, nationals from EU west, North America, Australia and Oceania, Asia and the UK are more likely to be in professional or managerial occupations. Even if all of these factors are still controlled, migrant workers earn less than their Irish equivalents. The current labour market is extremely stagnant with many employers refusing to raise wages even as workers enjoy increased options. A rebalancing is needed, even as the employers resist. This is especially the case with young people, who understand and demand pay transparency far more than their older counterparts. They understand that they are at risk of being left behind without it and businesses should recognise the competitive advantage that pay transparency gives them. I see that Government Senators may also be moving a Bill on this issue. I briefed the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, about this Bill late last year and I await his response today. He was minded to await the EU proposals on the matter so the issue seems to now be more about the timeline and means of implementation. I will yield the rest of my time to Deputy Conway-Walsh, who co-sponsors the Bill, but I want to acknowledge that in dealing with workers in recent years, workers’ rights are a serious issue. Only today I spoke to one of the Tralee Debenhams workers. These Debenhams workers have recently received, along with their colleagues across the country, a human rights award from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, for their work in standing up for workers' rights. I would like to commend them for their bravery in ensuring that stock was not removed from Debenhams stores without them receiving what was rightfully theirs for their many years of service. The Clerys workers have been waiting for eight years and the Debenhams workers have been waiting for nearly three years now. Retail is a sector which is particularly prone to pay issues with zero-hour contracts, precarious employment, and other measures used to squeeze workers."	spk_372
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-03-02	dail	33	Employment Equality (Pay Transparency) Bill 2022: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_42	I thank the Minister for the fact the Bill is unopposed. We are open to working with him and with any of the other Senators who are working on this issue. In my own experience at work, although I did not do very many employment law cases, anyone who came in with a problem in the workplace was not unionised and they had been messed around because there was no backup for them in the workplace. It is important to have small pieces of legislation pushing along in one direction to help them because the system tends to work against them. I recall that on Kerry County Council, we asked that any contracts that the council undertakes would deal only with unionised workplaces or workplaces that say someone is welcome to have a union in the workplace. I remember that the reply we received came from a firm of solicitors engaged by Kerry County Council. When I looked at the main page of its website, it said “How to hire and fire - an employer’s guide”. That is what an ordinary worker is up against. Hopefully, we can all work together on this small issue to try to push things along. As Deputy Nash said, we can work together so people are not put out in terms of their time and expense, like Mike, who I mentioned at the start, and who travelled up from Kerry at his own time and expense to do a job that could not take place, despite having a young family.	spk_380

Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-02-22	dail	33	Antisocial Behaviour	dbsect_3	In the dying days of Tralee Town Council, there was a focus on housing for the elderly. A scheme was enacted in respect of land at the rear of an old convent in the centre of town that was gifted by the Sisters of Mercy. The development there is called Tobar Naofa. I visited the area last week. There are 56 housing units constructed to the highest specifications, with their own heating system, which also covers some other houses in the area. It has come to my attention that ten of those 56 houses are vacant. Until 2014, there was a housing officer designated for the town of Tralee. Now, it is not the case that each municipal district looks after its own housing stock and emergency accommodation and homeless; rather, it is done for the whole county. Back in 2014, however, there was a particular focus. Since then, when we have sought housing, particularly for people who are single, separated, elderly, we have been told there is a massive shortage because the Government basically stopped the construction of social housing and there was no focus on it. The reliance on the market meant there were many three-bedroom semi-detached houses but no one-bedroom or two-bedroom houses. This is a most pressing need but ten of the houses to which I refer are currently vacant. Kerry County Council states that none of those houses or apartments have been vacant for longer than ten months but that is not the case. I can provide details in that regard. I have looked into it and the same thing can be seen throughout the county. I am aware of a house in Killarney that was sold back to the council under a particular scheme three and a half years ago. There are weeds growing up through the garden of that house in Ballyspillane. There are other houses in Ballyspillane that the council owns but they have not been maintained because the funding stream is not there. The freedom the old town councils had is no longer there. It seems that everything has to be channelled through a particular funding stream or else it cannot be done. Since I looked into the position regarding Tobar Naofa, it has come to my attention that the residents of three or four of the houses there are in long-term care. It was interesting to hear Deputy Murnane O'Connor speaking about the fair deal scheme. There are three or four other apartments, the residents of which are participants on the fair deal scheme. It is a sensitive issue but apparently the resident of one of those houses has been in a nursing home for three years under the fair deal scheme. I am not sure what kind of management of the housing stock in the county is going on, but surely, given the sensitivities, a meeting must be held. In effect, almost 25% of the 56 houses in question are vacant. These are one-bedroom and two-bedroom top-specification houses for the elderly. They are not like some older houses that were built in the 1970s or 1980s that might need to have windows and doors replaced. All they need is to be painted and for the electrics to be checked. They should be turned around within weeks rather than months but that is not happening. Who or what is managing the situation?	spk_6
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-02-22	dail	33	Antisocial Behaviour	dbsect_3	I read the Minister of State's reply, but what is not stated is the average length of time it takes Kerry County Council to turn around a vacant house. I understand that we have to deal with families and that there are items left behind, which is sometimes the case. In Tobar Naofa, there ten units are vacant. One vacant house facing onto the Dean's Lane side of the complex has been vacant for two years. It was constructed eight or nine years ago and would not need significant work in order to turn it around. Someone may have had a painting on the wall. Perhaps it needs a lick of paint, but that is about the height of it. There is another problem in that the council does not employ any painters. There may be a problem getting painters, but it is not acceptable to have such a long delay. It may very well be the case that the figures are as low as possible, as the Minister of State outlined, but I do not think that is the case. The turnaround time seems to be at least nine to 12 months. That might be okay where a complete retrofit is required, but it is not acceptable for all houses. Are targets being set by the Government to make sure that houses are turned around as quickly as possible? My view is that the abolition of the town councils has been a disaster for all types of housing management, in particular in Tralee, Killarney and Listowel. I dealt with a man from another part of Kerry recently who was made homeless. He was told that the only emergency accommodation is in the town of Tralee. That seems to have been the case for a long time. Even if a person is living on the Ring of Kerry or in north Kerry, the only place available is 40 miles or 50 miles away from their homeplace. That is not what is required. We need to do better.	spk_8

Tógfaidh mé deich nóiméad dom féin. I commend the Minister of State's speech, which is excellently written. I will deal with a few things in it. There is reference in it to assisting people with mental health and addiction conditions.As we know, I believe there were 7,000 call-outs to An Garda Síochána last year to deal with mental health crises. While we welcome the acknowledgement that this is taking place, any changes should happen in conjunction with mental health services. In Kerry, because there has been an outsourcing of mental health services, once an authorising officer has determined that somebody should be taken to a mental health centre, it often happens that no one is available to take them away from the Allied Admissions, and it falls back on An Garda Síochána to deliver the patient to the hospital. This leads to frustration in An Garda Síochána, which tends to be short staffed in the units.  I noticed that throughout the 20 minutes of the Minister of State's speech, not once was An Garda Síochána referred to as ""the force"", which is a positive step because in this day and age it is the incorrect term for a police service. I commend whoever wrote the speech on leaving that out. It should not be in a 21st century police service. I also noticed reference to Garda personnel, which is important and could be relevant to the legislation on bodycams we discussed last week, which specifically refers not to members of An Garda Síochána but to Garda personnel. That might need to be teased out at a later stage when discussing who has control of the data, for example. It is a very responsible role and we will have to look at that in further detail. I also welcome the Minister of State saying he will engage with any trade unions. We had an interesting contribution from the unions on the role of the civilian staff within An Garda Síochána. They had concerns, particularly for existing staff, that the potential to transfer to other Departments was being limited. That will also need to be looked at. Part 5 deals with the reform and organisation of the ombudsman. In future any State agencies will need to be referred to by the Irish name. I look forward to seeing that the official name as Gaeilge will be Oifig an Ombudsman Póilíneachta. That will be important and I thank the Minister of State for the contribution. The introduction of this Bill represents a culmination of the hard work of many people. It is appropriate we remember Dr. Vicky Conway, who tragically passed away last year. She was an unwavering voice in favour of police reform and accountability. Her contributions to the 2018 report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland were immense and her passing was a massive loss. I would like to return to that report to ensure we do not lose sight of its recommendations. At the time we made a detailed submission. A lot of time has elapsed since then and much debate took place during pre-legislative scrutiny. For some the Bill does not go far enough with police reform while for many within the wider policing community, such as representative organisations and unions, it may go too far. A balance needs to be struck but that can be done through a human rights focus which, to its credit, the Bill sets out to do for the first time in the State's history. The right to feel safe, have due process and seek justice for wrongs committed are at the heart of good policing. Many is the time, at joint policing committee, JPC, meetings in Kerry, it was important to emphasise that the role of An Garda Síochána is always to address crime and the causes of crime but also, most important, to address the fear of crime within the community. It is important that message goes out strongly from An Garda Síochána, especially in areas where the level of crime is very low but people still live in fear that their house will be burgled when it is very unlikely to happen. The Garda powers Bill, which is separate from the one at hand, has much to do in that regard. Section 4 of this Bill explicitly states that policing must take place independently and impartially in a manner that protects and vindicates human rights and in a manner supporting the proper and effective administration of justice. This echoes the first recommendation of the commission's report, namely, that human rights are the foundation and purpose of policing. I wish to examine who exactly is responsible for ensuring those principles are upheld in practice. On the face of it, the Bill addressed this by creating a new board of An Garda Síochána to which the Commissioner is accountable. The commission's report pointed out that any Garda Commissioner is unlikely to have gained a full skill set in running a large organisation throughout a career in policing. The board can provide a crucial function in that respect. I welcome that the Public Appointments Service will be involved in the selection of the board. This can also be teased out further on Committee Stage. The Bill also provides that the Commissioner shall be accountable to the board for the performance of his or her functions while being operationally independent. However, the watering down of the powers of the authority, which is explicitly not part of An Garda Síochána, is a concern. I will make a few comments on the authority and the inspectorate. The Bill transfers the various functions of the authority to either An Garda Síochána, the Commissioner under the guidance of the board or the Minister, with the policing and community safety authority having a consultative role at most. The inspectorate is also abolished and the policing and community safety authority is created in place of both organisations. It is difficult to see how accountability can now be increased while the work of both, which is very different in this context, is now to be undertaken by one body. While this respects the recommendations of the commission, a crucial aspect is missing. The report proposes that:PCSOC should have a remit to oversee the relevant activity of all agencies involved in policing and the prevention of harm, at both national and local level. It should scrutinise policing performance, carry out inspections, promote professional standards and coordinate and support local structures for community engagement with police.Sinn Féin supports a whole-of-justice-system inspectorate and it is a disappointment to see that the Bill now narrows the authority's remit to only An Garda Síochána. If a future scandal were to arise, it would not be difficult to see the Commissioner asserting that its accountability is solely to the board, which is, in itself, responsible for the interests of An Garda Síochána rather than to the authority. Again, Committee Stage amendments may clear some of this up. The reform of GSOC, through the creation of the IOPO is a major part of the commission's report, our submission and this Bill. The organisation has long been crippled by an overly complex complaints procedure, understaffing and sometimes a lack of co-operation, support and resources. I pay tribute to the work of Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring who once sent a diagram of the complaints procedure to it. She has advocated for change and it is arriving in the form of this Bill. Communication about performance management issues, which constitute the majority of complaints, as well as the issues relating to us, as representatives, must be improved. The requirement of the ombudsman to track trends in its work is important in this respect as certain issues must then feed back into performance management within An Garda Síochána. The powers of search which the ombudsman has were criticised, but they are crucial to ensure proper accountability. This is the heart of the issue with the new policing ombudsman. I quote from the report:All complaints that go beyond performance management, and involve alleged breaches of human rights or accepted standards of policing, should be investigated by IOPO itself, not by police, and IOPO should be adequately resourced to do so.I cannot go into details given that it involves cases currently before the courts, but we have seen some pretty extraordinary allegations which have resulted in arrests and charges. The Commissioner's establishment of an anticorruption unit is important but there is also risk if police are investigating themselves. We need lasting structures to ensure the good work lasts. The Bill also creates a new category of Garda personnel, comprising An Garda Síochána members and civilian staff - currently civilian staff. We are not opposed to civilianisation of police as it frees up gardaí from front-line duties, as the Minister of State mentioned. Government has done some good work in this area even as it has seen the number of sworn members decrease. A number of unions have voiced their concerns about the move and wish to see this system retained to allow staff to transfer into and out of An Garda Síochána, and this must be retained. Another avenue to avoid accountability was that the Garda was also responsible for national security. The creation of the office of independent examiner is extremely welcome. The Bill does not seem explicitly to require this person to be a judge but provides that a judge may hold the office. This examiner reviews national security and provides requests, and this work should be informed by human rights and accountability.The community safety partnerships are also welcome, as their powers seem appropriate and can give more practical effect to local input from elected representatives. There is a slight concern that the powers are not clearly defined in primary legislation and a great deal of detail will fall to the Minister through secondary legislation. However, we can examine that matter."	spk_316

I visited an award-winning social housing scheme for older people of 56 houses. I was informed that ten of those houses are empty and another four have been unoccupied for more than three years because the tenants are part of the fair deal scheme and have been in a nursing home for up to three years. Almost 25% of the houses in this scheme, which was constructed in around 2014 or 2015, is heated from a central source and is award-winning, are currently empty. At a local level, I note that all emergency accommodation in the entire county of Kerry is funnelled into Tralee town centre. There are four or five hostels within 250 m of each other. At a local level, there seems to be no coherent strategy for dealing with it that would allow people who become homeless around the county to remain in their local areas. On a general level, we have seen that the Government has lost control of the homeless situation. It did not introduce an emergency response ban. There are 11,000 people who are officially homeless, but the reality is that figure is up to 18,000 when we take into account the number of people who are in emergency accommodation. I call on the Minister to deal with the issue at a local level and to give the local authorities targets. I spoke to the Minister last summer in relation to money that was made available for councils to purchase housing stock. The councils were saying that they did not receive the instruction. I think the then Taoiseach described that as a cop-out by Kerry County Council. There seems to be a communication problem between the two. Clear targets need to be given to the local authorities to deal with the housing stock that they have. The Government must also use emergency planning and procurement powers to ensure that there are more social and affordable homes, as well as extending the ban on evictions, which must be done immediately.	spk_187

Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-02-16	dail	33	Co-ordination of International Protection Services: Statements	dbsect_32	"It is nearly two years since the Government published its White Paper on ending direct provision. This followed on from the Catherine Day report into the system and recommendations from the Joint Committee on Justice. Both offered some hope of an end to the inhumane system of direct provision, which is totally inefficient and expensive and where one provider earned €400 million. Direct provision was originally established as a stop-gap measure. The Day report was clear in most of its recommendations and committed the Government to addressing several areas where refugees required support. In welfare, work and education, it recommended access to driver licences, more immediate access to the labour market and better welfare supports. This was supposed to be the end of the impoverishment of residents, who had to subsist at the time on around €35 weekly. The demand for this work came from refugees themselves as part of a campaign by the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, MASI, and reflected the desire to be given a chance at earning a living. Barriers to entry still exist, however, as there is still a waiting period of six months for international protection applicants. The White Paper also committed to creating a means-tested international protection payment. Again, this was supported by MASI, demonstrating the desire from refugees to earn their own way, but we have yet to see it implemented. Catherine Day correctly took the view that she needed to look not just at accommodation but also at the processing of asylum claims. At the time, there were some waits of up to seven years. Delays can also cause great stress for applicants, leaving them in limbo. Legal avenues for appeal and due process must of course be respected, but the length of delay was too much. In response to this, both the Catherine Day report and the White Paper recommended that measures be taken, through the use of technology, for example, to speed up applications. Amazingly, we are still seeing the use of paper forms, some of which are now being completed without the benefit of legal advice. The Day report did recommend the granting of a leave to remain for those spending two years or more in the system, a matter on which the White Paper was silent on. The undocumented scheme sought to address this and did some good work but there will be further backlogs soon. We need a system that is efficient and fair, and co-operation across the Departments of Justice and Foreign Affairs especially is required. The overwhelming majority of asylum seekers arriving are fleeing persecution but all deserve to have their applications dealt with swiftly to give them certainty. The White Paper identified other flaws that should have been tackled as such with proper legislation and the establishment of an agency to co-ordinate many of its aspects, but it goes without saying that the most obvious miss was in relation to housing. The White Paper foresaw two phases in terms of accommodation: the first being State-owned reception centres, where applicants could spend their first six months; and the second involving more medium- to long-term accommodation. We have seen little or no progress on the reception centres which were supposed to be specially built to suit refugees' needs and located in appropriate places close to services. The second phase was left somewhat open-ended with approved housing body, AHB, accommodation, rent-a-room schemes, turnkey acquisitions and the refurbishment of commercial properties all in the mix. The Government made a start on turnkey acquisitions but the Russian aggression in Ukraine and the subsequent refugee crisis did, I accept, cause challenges. No attempt was made, however, in relation to the AHB housing, and with no increase in the capital spend next year, it is hard to see any progress forthcoming in expanding the housing stock. In other areas, with Ukrainians, asylum seekers and those living here already, the Government must show action on Sláintecare, especially GP care and primary care centres. These are inadequate. For example, the out-of-hours services in Listowel for SouthDoc are totally inadequate. All-party consensus was supposed to be present within health, yet we see that Government implementation is way behind. It was difficult to find a GP for many over the past number of years, and putting vulnerable people who need treatment into towns and villages already struggling causes problems. This, though, is no fault of families who are in hotel rooms, and the protests outside their rooms are wrong. IPAS can conjure up accommodation from wherever, but without a whole-of-government response, this will only cause trouble. While I welcome the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O’Brien, he is, in effect, triple jobbing and this is only going to be one of the areas for which he will have responsibility. This is not good enough. I have described the Government’s plans to end direct provision as effectively being shelved, so I was amazed to find in a recent response to a parliamentary question that spending in the Department responsible is going down, yet commitments remain on the table. Some honesty there is required, and there is a need to work with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on targets for the overall housing stock and specialised accommodation. These are some of the measures we need. Our international obligations must be delivered. It is important that we are having this debate, because it is a long-standing problem. Everyone needs services and it is this need that they share with some of the people who have found themselves in refugee centres. A mentality of division has been fostered by this Government - and previous governments - and the parties that constitute it for a long time. We see this in the context of the pandemic bonus payment. We see it in the pitting of the private sector against the public sector, rural against urban and, even yesterday, existing renters against new renters on rent pressure zones. Unfortunately, the division is rearing its ugly head across the State. Concerns about housing, crime and health are foremost in people's minds. Due to vacant properties being in areas where many vulnerable working-class people live, and in tourist and seasonal towns, there is interaction with migrants and refugees. The response has been worrying. The vast majority of people in Ireland are decent, welcoming and fair, and we have seen this in the response to the international protection applicants and Ukrainians. The traction being gained by a small minority is due to an inherent exploitation of fears. I wish briefly to quote Roy Jenkins, a Welshman, a British minister and a European Commissioner in the 1970s. He recognised that people in Britain had been constantly stimulated and jolted out of a natural island lethargy by a whole series of immigrations, similar to here. He said that in the 1970s, when Irish people were being picked upon, ""a few people, whether out of political opportunism or personal inadequacy, [had] deliberately whipped up prejudice, playing on fear and ignorance, and blaming the immigrants for the problems which were none of their making but which stemmed from previous parsimony in housing, schools and welfare services"".We need a united front against this rising tide of hate and we must combat falsehoods. Some 8 million Ukrainians have been displaced and less than 1% of those are in Ireland. There are no international protection applicants skipping social housing lists. The median processing time is about ten months. In 2021, only 0.4% of total EU immigrants came to Ireland and in November 2022 less than 1% of asylum applicants were in Ireland. Many of them have contributed to retail and to the Covid response. Before I finish, I want to remember two people, both of whom happen to be from the south-east corner of my county. Joe Madden was buried on Monday morning. He was born in a mother and baby home. He was boarded out to Kilgarvan in County Kerry and at 16 he had to leave and ended up in Paddington Station alone with a suitcase, a migrant in a new life. I also want to remember Mike Quill, the famous Kilgarvan and Kerry man who was the leader of the transit workers in New York and who organised the poor and exploited people and worked for the civil rights for minorities. He said he worked for people who were ""so low down on the economic and social ladder that [they] had nowhere to go but up."" We should respect Mike Quill and Joe Madden, the latter of whom died and was buried on Monday morning. We should respect those migrants. It is the least we can do."	spk_325

It is understandable that there is some extra impetus behind it, given some of the recent assaults we have seen on rank and file gardaí. At the same time, doing so in a hurry creates a risk. The Minister's comments that everybody is entitled to go about their business without interference, and that everything should be proportionate, are interesting. Whenever I think of new legislation, I think of two cases from my previous work history. The first is when I was called to Store Street Garda station in the aftermath of the introduction of the drug trafficking offences legislation, which was supposed to target the large-scale criminals, the drug lords. The first person I was called to see was a young woman who was living in the Regina Coeli hostel in Dublin 7. Somebody had told the Garda that she had a small amount of drugs in her locker in the hostel. She had a young child in the hostel with her. When I arrived, she asked if it was true that she could be held there for seven days. There was also an implication that her custody of her child would be in danger as a result. Clearly, that is not what the legislation was intended for, but it was what happened on the ground. I also think of a second person, especially in light of the automatic numberplate recognition that is coming in. It is being introduced to tackle criminals, but as the Minister says himself, everyone is entitled to go about their business without interference. An 18-year old young man from north Kerry who was attending one of the colleges in Tralee came into my office. He was stopped on Racecourse Road coming away from the college. He was pulled over by the Garda. I would say this young fellow had not even had a parking fine in his life, but he was stopped and asked a number of questions about drugs, if he had access to drugs, who he knew and if he could give information. I knew that he had no truck with criminality and when we dug deep into it, it turned out that one of the previous owners of his car had a history of drugs and the numberplate technology that came up in the Garda car identified the car as having been at one stage involved in drugs. He came into my office rather shaken over the whole experience, but while this type of legislation is again targeted at the big criminals, there is a danger that the young 18-year old man or the single mother in the Regina Coeli hostel are the ones that, broadly, could be targeted and upset and who could have their daily business interfered with by overreaching legislation. Notwithstanding the recent assaults - I understand the impetus - it is important to understand where and how these devices are used. We are somewhat hamstrung today, as the Minister in fairness mentioned, that some of the facial recognition technology has not been introduced and will be included on Committee Stage. It is difficult to have much of a debate about it because we do not know what is coming in. I note that the Garda Commissioner, as the Minister mentioned, recently gave an interview saying it was the intention to use facial recognition technology with the bodycams. One could ask if that is proportionate. We can tease that out later, on Committee Stage in particular. It would be important to put in place a pilot scheme in one or two areas before we rush into all of this to look at the effectiveness of this new technology before it is introduced. On the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny, when we discussed the Bill last year, I raised concerns then about the wide discretion of the Bill for the use of such devices. The general scheme allowed for the use of the devices so long as it was ""necessary and proportionate"" for the securing of public safety and the carrying out of the Garda duties. The revised Bill improves on this somewhat, as it has more specific grounds for the use of the devices such as executing a court order or warrant, or recording damage to a property. I also expressed concerns on the definition of an ""arrestable offence"". In all of the other legislation, where somebody is to be arrested under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984, an arrestable offence is defined as something which can carry a prison sentence of up to five years, but that covers nearly everything. If a person steals a Mars bar from a shop and the person is prosecuted by his or her choice or by the judge, on indictment, that falls under the Act. Is that necessary or proportionate? There should be some safeguards in that regard. Recording devices should not be used unless it is for one of the specific purposes. Perhaps an even more detailed set of circumstances could be set out before the legislation is enacted. Another concern expressed in the justice committee at the time was related to the code of practice. It was unclear at the time when it was to be available and if the Dáil would have any role in scrutinising it. The phrase ""code of practice"" appears no less than 35 times in the legislation, which has about the same number of pages, and there is a presumption of lawfulness where any conduct confirms with a code of practice. The rank of garda who can approve a search of automated numberplate recognition data is also to be set out in a code of practice rather than within primary legislation. I can understand the need for flexibility on issues such as the type of recording device used, which I see is subscribed and has to be justified under a code of practice, but in other matters there does need to be more certainty. An easy solution would be to strengthen section 43 and give the Policing Authority more than just a consultative role in drafting these codes of practice.The provisions on data are fairly focused on removing legal obstacles for the smooth functioning of the system and address concerns about the storage of data and how these can be accessed by persons who encounter the Garda. Some independent and verifiable records of when devices are used and when a defendant can expect to access data, such as before trial or on foot of proceedings, are crucial. Footage can obviously be prejudicial to defendants, for good and ill. The equality of the legal arms of the State will be placed out of balance if the Garda has access to footage without any right for a defendant to view it. It is important to keep that in mind. I am pleased the Bill addresses the use of CCTV by local authorities. That is a good thing. For a long time, particularly since local authorities abdicated their former responsibility to collect waste, there has been an explosion of illegal dumping, especially in rural areas. Many people either cannot or will not subscribe to a private operator that demands that €30 is kept in their accounts and where there is a monthly fee of €14 or €15, whether people access the service or not. In a cost-of-living crisis, when money is tight, people will choose not to subscribe. They either go to the effort of bringing their rubbish to private operators or engage in illegal dumping. The amount of dumping can be seen along the sides of roads now that, by and large, is composed of plastic bottles. Something has to be done about removing plastic bottles. Domestic rubbish is also thrown by the side of the road. For a long time, local authorities decided they could not use CCTV to deal with this issue because of data protection issues but it would not be hard to do if they appointed data protection officers to be responsible for data storage. However, there was significant reluctance to do that. That is one part of the Bill that I welcome. It is to be hoped that it will tackle the scourge of illegal dumping, which is a particular problem in rural areas.  I look forward to further debate on the Bill. I ask the Government, especially those members of it who sit on the Joint Committee on Justice, to be very wary of the new, over-reaching legislation, especially in respect of number plate technology and facial recognition. Such legislation should be proportionate. Before anything is put in place, pilot schemes should be rolled out to see whether the legislation is necessary and proportionate before there is an erosion of civil liberties relating to it."	spk_183

She can only be described as someone who has survived her treatment in CAMHS. Some other children in County Kerry and their parents, with whom I have spoken, must have laughed when they heard rhetoric about cherishing all children of the nation equally after, for example, scrambling around looking for a bed for their daughter with a life-threatening eating disorder. We see the physical and mental damage caused by overprescribing and over-medicating. Regarding children given anti-psychotic medication for relatively minor mental health difficulties, one child said it felt like she was in a cartoon with hallucinations and going around like a zombie when she only needed help for a sleep disorder. We see the loss of potential and the loss of family cohesion. Since the Government came into power, waiting lists for CAMHS have increased by 86%. The number of children waiting longer than a year has increased by 168%. Coming up on the train this morning, I heard about the State strategy for defending nursing home charge claims. Last Monday week, as the news broke about the Mental Health Commission, the HSE gatekeepers, who are never slow to miss an opportunity, saw a good day to announce that it was going to carry out a full look-back review into the north Kerry cases. When looking into what was in the statement, the HSE said it was going to carry it out but that it would take what it described as a little time to put the clinical team in place. It should be remembered that this is from an organisation that said last October it would produce the north Kerry review in two weeks. The HSE said it would also need an independent expert to chair the review. We still do not have this expert. When I repeated a call for the review to stretch back over 15 years, the HSE said its priority was to review the young people currently under the care of the north Kerry CAMHS team, which is what the Mental Health Commission had already got earlier on that day, so a bit of a three-card trick was announced on that day.  I am calling for the HSE to review all the open cases, as is recommended by the Mental Health Commission; immediately regulate CAMHS under the Mental Health Act; reinstate a national clinical director to ensure accountability; most importantly, develop the national standards for monitoring anti-psychotic medication; and give us a timeframe for the review of all north Kerry cases going back over 15 years, particularly where Risperidone was prescribed. The children and people of north Kerry deserve no less than that.	spk_187
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-01-24	dail	33	Forestry Sector: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_21	Over the past week or so, dozens of people have contacted my office about this joint venture with Gresham House and about the subsidisation, collaboration and corporate takeover by this UK equity fund. Many people who contacted me raised the sell-off of telecoms, housing and bins, the attempted sell-off of water, the sale of the national lottery and now the sale of our forestry. Some of them had lived abroad, such as in Germany and England, and had seen what had happened there following similar sell-offs to vulture funds. A man from a hill farmers' organisation asked how people in his line of work, who are not wealthy people, were expected to compete with this type of investment fund. Throughout Kerry, people talk about Sitka spruce and the damage it has done. In Knocknagashel and Brosna, the rivers have, in effect, been poisoned. The brown trout that used to swim there, along with other signs of biodiversity, have gone. The same is true of Lickeen Wood and Glanteenassig. A man from Glencar told me it is similar to the way the Caragh river has been blocked off to locals, who cannot even swim in it without someone saying it has been taken into private hands. The widespread demand of all the people who contacted me, comprising a coalition of farmers, forestry people and environmentalists, was for a forestry strategy that will deliver for the environment, local communities and the economy, but this subsidised, grubby joint venture will deliver none of that. The venture appears intended solely to circumvent the rules that prohibit Coillte from receiving its subsidies for afforestation and partnering with a company that will be motivated primarily by profit, and that is not good for the selfsame farmers' groups, forestry people and environmentalists. The Government should be upfront and it is not too late for that. It should try to halt this joint venture and publish its new forestry strategy as soon as possible.	spk_426
Pa Daly	43	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2023-01-18	dail	33	Capacity in the Health Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_15	Most of the staff in University Hospital Kerry are too busy dealing with a hospital that was built in 1984 to serve 120,000 people, when County Kerry now has a population of 160,000, to be out campaigning. There were glad when a review of the hospital was promised. A team visited the hospital and staff there were told a transformation team was needed. A review and interviews were carried out but in the past ten days or so, staff were told that that review has been shelved. Staff are back to square one. I will give two examples. Oncology services in Kerry hospital include cancer patients and some of the most vulnerable people. Those with black humour are calling the oncology unit the homeless unit because, in the middle of the Covid pandemic, that unit was sent to palliative care. There was then a plan. Somebody thought it would be a great idea to spend €2 million to place the oncology unit in a private hospital, while that private hospital would invest a fraction of that amount. Thankfully, that idea was shelved but it is worrying that it was seriously considered. After palliative care, the unit is now being moved to the day ward. Oncology patients are on the day ward so surgeries for day patients have been cancelled and not one surgery has been carried out this year. Some 20 operations have been cancelled. The unit will probably be closed. If the last surgery is anything to go by, the day unit will probably be closed for months. The stakes in healthcare services have never been higher. There have been decades of neglect in respect of staffing and infrastructure. We accept that cannot be fixed overnight but one person told me that hospital staff in Kerry are under nearly as much pressure as they were during Covid and there is no sign of improvements. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, recently reported that 20 patients were on trolleys in University Hospital Kerry. Last December, 36 patients had been waiting more than six months for inpatient procedures and 476 outpatients were waiting for the same time period. For a county the size of Kerry, these are extraordinary numbers. With an ageing and rural population, in a county with high peripherality and three peninsulas, the solutions for Kerry are obvious. Beds mean staff who must be trained. Retention and training need to be prioritised. That includes other areas. There are ways to ease the pressure. There must be more public involvement in community hospital step-down facilities and 70 or so beds.	spk_336

Ba chóir go mbeadh dualgas dáiríre chun an disclosure sin a dhéanamh mar tá an ceart ag daoine a fháil amach. Is ceart agus is cóir é sin. Dá mbeadh an reachtaíocht seo ann in 2014, bheadh a fhios ag na hothair, na mná sin, an toradh a bhí acu. We do not have any issue with what is in the Bill. We do not have any issue with the amendments either. Thanks be to God, there is information on other issues going through the system at present, for example through trolley count. I recently dealt with a case in Tralee involving a woman in her late 70s from the north of the county. Families are stressed because there is no isolation room in University Hospital Kerry. This woman was left on a trolley for days. We were able to do something about that because the information from trolley count was there. We have an issue with the process and with the absence of any statutory duty of candour in the Bill. There is no obligation on a provider or clinician to inform a patient about the right to the Part 5 review. There should be a system through the cancer registry that notifies patients of their right. Ba chóir go mbeadh an ceart ag gach éinne gach eolas a bheith acu ar an gcóras sin. We do not have the discovery of a discordant, erroneous or otherwise inaccurate reading of the cancer screening sample as a notifiable incident. When the system was changed and the outsourcing happened it was Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, almost alone, who pointed out that this would cause problems. He has not been given enough credit for his foresight on that occasion. If he had been listened to at the time, maybe many of the incidents would not have happened.There should be a duty of candour and to make a disclosure. It is important to make this point again and again because the patient has the right to know. If this legislation about the anonymous programmatic audit was in place eight years ago, all those women would have been informed of the reading and would have been able to see it in their files. They would never have discovered it until they asked for a review. In the words of another, this legislation would have made sure that nobody would have found out what was going on with CervicalCheck, since people were not given the right to information unless they sought it. Unfortunately, the Bill does not place an obligation on a clinician or service provider to inform a patient when the error or inaccuracy is discovered. No matter what type of information it is or how severe the misreading is, there is no obligation to tell anyone that something wrong was found. The Government is forgetting that patients are at the heart of this. We must protect the viability of the screening services. There will be about 250,000 screenings this year, which is welcome. We all want to see this grow but we must protect the rights of patients. We must have a national health service, like in England, which is free at the point of access. In the meantime, we must improve and expand medical card access to cover home care and palliative care. When it comes to who is responsible for a person getting the truth, the burden should not be placed on the person who has cancer to ask. We must acknowledge the mistakes by clinicians and doctors in the past and not stand behind an approach which puts a responsibility on the patient to take the steps while placing no obligation, except after a request, on any clinician to make a proactive, open disclosure, whether about cancer screening or something else. One specialist who provides counselling said they see a State that pays lip service to acknowledge its mistake and that systematic failures are blocking and resistant to change, causing ongoing heartache.	spk_246
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-12-06	dail	33	Gambling Regulation Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_11	"I will start with a procedural point. This Bill was announced as being approved by the Cabinet on 15 November, yet it took a full two weeks for a copy to materialise. We had pre-legislative scrutiny on detailed heads of the Bill but as we all know, the final version of a Bill can be much different. It would be better if the Government only announced Bills as being ready for approval when a full version can accompany that announcement. It would give staff time to prepare to consult stakeholders and so on. We would also be better able to field queries from constituents, as outlined by Deputy Gould, when legislation is announced. I appreciate that there is usually not a long delay but if the Government is to generate publicity off the back of a Bill, the actual wording being available is a reasonable expectation. An overhaul of the regulation of gambling in this State is long overdue. According to the Health Research Board, HRB, an estimated 12,000 adults in Ireland are problem gamblers and a further 125,000 are considered to be at-risk gamblers. In addition, the study showed that more than one in ten men who have gambled in the last year are either at-risk or problem gamblers. This figure increases to one in five in younger cohorts. Finally, the HRB states that at-risk and problem gambling appears to be more strongly associated with poorer socioeconomic status and living in deprived areas. The risks are devastating, as we know. As elected Deputies, I am sure we are all aware of local constituents who have suffered greatly as a result of gambling, whether that is because of debt or sometimes taking their own lives. No one is denying anyone the right to have the odd flutter on occasion. A legal and properly regulated gambling industry is important to stave off the involvement of organised crime. However, the key is regulation. The expansion of online gambling and the constant innovation of products in the sector means the State is in a race to protect the vulnerable. The regulation of online gambling, including the banning of bets at certain times, or at least the identification of patterns of betting that indicate someone is at risk, is important. The draft heads of Bill placed a number of obligations on providers in relation to this and I notice these are now absent from the Bill. The gambling exclusion register is a positive development but by the time someone has made an application, their losses could be significant. Anecdotally, we have heard of a lot of people losing money in the early hours of the morning when they are coming home and have alcohol taken. It is not acceptable that the online operators can utilise the great amount of information they have on customers, through algorithms and so on, to infinitely expand their business without being compelled to use that information to prevent great losses being racked up, especially for those who have finite resources. That information also puts the online sector at an inherent advantage compared to the traditional retail bookmaker. A levy that reflects that would level the playing field. The work of my colleague Deputy Gould in this area, including his Private Members' Bill to ban credit card betting, should be commended. People who work in the industry have suggested that a tax levied on online deposits might also have some effect. Public awareness and gambling addiction treatment should also be discussed alongside the Bill. The social fund is a welcome addition here but there needs to be a sea change alongside it. The treatment of gambling addiction is frequently linked to mental health. While the link is undoubtedly strong, gambling addiction is a specific issue too. We are beginning to get a handle on how to treat those with other addictions. Research into gambling addiction specifically should be the result of it. Again, this is something the Bill covers. A specific public awareness campaign free of industry influence would be important. Being ""gambling aware"" does little to help those with addiction. They could not be more aware of it if they tried. Supporting them in getting away from gambling is what we need to do. Supports and campaigns must be free of industry influence. The social impact fund will hopefully be a useful firewall for this. I note that football now dominates bets placed here. Nearly all Premier League teams are dominated by the industry and betting companies. The funding to sports needs to reflect this as the social dividend from the elite levels of the game, supported by the industry, does not trickle down to the grassroots. For many local sports clubs, lotteries, bingo and even World Cup draws can be incredible fundraisers when run by clubs and leagues. We have received a few representations from bingo halls recently about their unique status. That is a subject to which we will return on Committee Stage. Regulatory costs must be borne by those most able to bear them, and smaller clubs and associations must not be completely discouraged from solid fundraising opportunities. The credit union sector, for example, has been regulated heavily, and understandably so, but we need to be mindful that regulations can have unintended consequences that we cannot foresee. Other improvements over pre-legislative scrutiny include the removal of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's ability to reclaim surpluses from the social impact fund. The provisions around age verification look to have been improved also, as there is a current issue with some sites where gambling can proceed before age verification is complete. This is wrong. The less ambiguity there is within legislation, the better. There are a number of other issues within the Bill but we intend to cover those on Committee Stage."	spk_126

            (a) enjoyment of live broadcasts, subsequent transmissions and online media coverage of sports by television and audiovisual media service providers is extended, to the greatest extent possible, equally to the whole community of the island of Ireland, particularly in the case of, but not limited to, events of major importance to the Irish nation, and(b) participation is equally accessible to the public across the whole of the island of Ireland and not restricted to any one part or parts of the island in the event of any game of chance, interactive competition or poll, including phone-in, SMS, or online competitions, quizzes and surveys organised by a television broadcaster or audiovisual media service provider.(2) From 1 January 2024, Spórt Éireann shall only provide assistance to an organisation under section 8(4)(a) of the Sport Ireland Act 2015, following the commencement of this Act, where that organisation makes every practicable effort within their control, such as through the licensing of broadcasting rights to their events, to ensure that any broadcast of events organised by the licence-holder, whether live, in subsequent transmissions, or in online catalogues, is made equally accessible to the public on the whole island of Ireland, and places no barrier to their equal availability across the whole island.”.”.Similar to the previous amendment, this deals with the duty of broadcasters to the whole island. We have reworded our amendment since Committee Stage as it was ruled out of order, but thankfully that is no longer the case. Subsection (1) calls on the coimisiún to prepare a report within a year on how TV and audiovisual coverage of sport, especially major sports events, as well as access to participate in phone-in or online competitions, polls or games, could be extended to the whole island. This deals with what was discussed on Committee Stage. Supporters of both teams in the North are not allowed to watch their own team play and are being denied entry to competitions during the game which features their own team or the team they support.It is a matter of examining how we can end this exclusion. Subsection (2) goes a step further and will make Sport Ireland funding to sports organisations conditional on making every practicable effort to ensure broadcasting rights for their events are equally accessible North and South. Sporting organisations will still be allowed to decide not to do so to maximise profits by selling broadcasting rights in a way that will leave people on one side of the Border without equal access, but they will not be allowed to receive State funds if they do so. This will come into effect in January 2024. I hope Deputy Catherine Martin, as Minister with responsibility for both media and sport, can accept the amendment and ensure State funding will not be used to divide Ireland further by cutting off almost 2 million people on the island from participating in key sporting moments for the nation."	spk_505

While my party colleague Deputy Munster discussed one of the amendments in the grouping, I will focus on amendments Nos. 45 and 46, which relate to lines 22 and 23 of page 51. I understand from the debate that took place in the Seanad that this wording is considered a necessary ground for banning a broadcast to comply with Article 40.6 of the Constitution. Paragraph 1° of this Article sets out the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions. It states, ""The education of public opinion being, however, a matter of such grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State."" It is perplexing, then, that the Minister is being selective in regard to which elements of the Article to reiterate in the Bill. Anything that may reasonably be regarded as tending to undermine the authority of the State is prohibited. The authority of the State is the only element of the constitutional provision on free speech specifically mentioned in this law, and this is a worrying focus. There is no caveat to ensure that the need to protect against undermining the authority of the State will be balanced against the need to preserve liberty of expression. Given the Minister is not proposing to include in this ban anything regarded as undermining public order or morality, which feature in the same sentence as the phrase ""authority of the State"" in that Article of the Constitution, we can safely assume there is no need to reiterate anything, because it is already law.That is why we propose to delete this provision with amendment No. 45. In the event that this is not acceptable to the Minister, we propose an alternative wording whereby the same need to balance this protection with the need to preserve liberty of expression is included in the provision. The caveat included in the Constitution specifies that criticism of Government policy is grounds for speech being protected and we have repeated that here. There is real danger that a criticism of Government policy could be interpreted as undermining the authority of the State. It is not right that coimisiún na meán or broadcasters would be left fearing that if they allow such content to be broadcast, they might be in breach of the law and, therefore, the Minister should clarify in law that criticism of Government policy is protected or confirm that. Otherwise, this is a worrying step towards draconian restrictions by Government on what can be broadcast."	spk_512

This is discrimination, pure and simple, and it is unacceptable. We have a chance to enshrine equal pay for equal work in the law. It has been done in many other areas but if this level of discrimination was to take place on any other grounds, it would be considered scandalous and be dealt with in legislation. The Minister, Deputy Martin, said it would be inappropriate to introduce legislative provisions in this regard but if legislation is not an appropriate place to prohibit discrimination, where is? I am glad that the Minister has written to RTÉ in this regard but it is too little too late. I am informed that the matter was first raised with RTÉ in the year 2000 yet the broadcaster has the nerve to tell Deputies that it had not been made aware of the issue. The review of pay scales is already under way and Dee Forbes stated clearly to the Dáil Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media that the review will not consider the issue of different pay based on the language of work.

Earlier this week I spoke to the head of the South Kerry Development Partnership about the work it does in the rural social schemes and Tús schemes in south Kerry. I refer here to care of the elderly, social farming, the rural men's officer, DJ Moran, whom it employs, the maintenance of sports fields and support for meals on wheels. It assists 200 projects in the area. However, the people working on those schemes only receive an extra €19 on top of their social welfare. That is supposed to help them with their travel expenses and fuel and its increased price. According to the latest CSO figures, the CPI rose by 9.2% from October last year to October this year. The price of water, gas and other fuels have risen by nearly 28% over the same period. More alarmingly, consumer prices rose by 1.6% between September and October of this year while water, electricity and gas rose by nearly 9% in that time. I do not need to tell the House what a 10% increase, month on month, over the course of the year will do to people. I have also heard from local businesses that have seen their bills increase by these amounts - sometimes tripling or even quadrupling - in that time. The equation for these small businesses is simple: get help or fold. A capping of electricity prices at previous levels is what they need. We also need a massive investment in renewables because the latter are cheaper and more stable. We are currently far too exposed to energy shocks. Any transition must be fair, however. The regulations and laws have a part to play, but correcting economic inequality cannot be done at the stroke of a pen. That is why measures such as the prioritising of retrofitting for those at risk of energy poverty are so crucial. The Government needs to act. It needs to do more. It needs to cap electricity prices. What it has done so far is a mistake. It needs to act to help the people who work around the Ring of Kerry and the small businesses.	spk_27
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-11-16	dail	33	Ceisteanna ar Pholasaí nó ar Reachtaíocht - Questions on Policy or Legislation	dbsect_13	I recently came across a parliamentary question from 22 February 1951 which asked when was it intended to proceed with the Annascaul water and sewerage schemes. The reply was that the Minister was not in a position to state when the work would commence. Seventy-one years later, we had a briefing from Kerry County Council on the residential-zoned land tax that there are more small towns and villages out of the scope of the tax than are actually in scope. Annascaul is at maximum capacity and needs work on its wastewater treatment. That is in addition to other places. There are three students here from Gaelcholáiste Chiarraí who might be interested. Annascaul, Camp, Glenbeigh, Fenit, Castlegregory, Kilflynn among others need it. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, says that it will be 20 years before water can be adequately cleaned. Development in these towns and villages is being hampered because you cannot build more than two houses because the system is not there. When will the Government do a proper system and allocate proper money so that these can proceed?	spk_130
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-11-15	dail	33	 Retained Firefighters: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_16	I commend Deputy Brady on proposing the motion. He has a long history of advocacy on this issue. Credit must also go to the National Retained Firefighters Association of Ireland. We debate health and emergency measures in the House regularly and the issues that occur in other areas are unfortunately relevant here too. Fire services are understaffed to dangerous levels and experienced firefighters are leaving at a rapid rate. The sacrifices we ask these individuals to make on our behalf are extreme and many face the risk of death and injury weekly. A poor work-life balance, bad conditions, and paltry pay all play a role in many walking away. With a guaranteed income of only €8,500, many find obtaining a mortgage a struggle. This is in a job where people are on call 24-7 and have fewer days off per year than do those in similar roles. This puts a massive strain on people and their families. I spoke to a firefighter from Kerry today who said he could be out in the car with his children and get a call, meaning his partner has to come to the station as well, so families are on call too. Pensions are poor and as a result progression is difficult, with a top-heavy management structure. In Kerry there have been regular gorse, grass and bush fires. Radio Kerry reported that in one weekend last summer, nearly two-thirds of calls were related to these types of fires. Firefighters must be supported when such events occur. There is a particular crisis with retention in Kerry. In larger towns like Tralee or Killarney there could be a number of calls but this decreases across the county. In addition, firefighters face difficulty when it comes to weather warnings as there are no nationally-agreed protocols on whether it is safe or not for them to work during such warnings. The national directorate has no representation of retained firefighters on it and there is a worrying element of confusion about the future of the service. This was added to by the Taoiseach who told my colleague, Deputy Stanley, the issues must be dealt with by the local authorities in the context of existing industrial relations mechanisms. However, more recently he changed his tune and questioned whether local authorities should have retained firefighters at all. That is not good enough for the public or for workers. We need an urgent review of pay and conditions on a cross-party basis and I call on all Kerry Deputies to support this motion.	spk_276
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-11-10	dail	33	Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_35	"We welcome the intent behind the Bill and the effort and work that has clearly gone into addressing the needs of people who experience hatred on account of who they are. As the Minister said, people need to feel safe and we accept that the current Act is not effective. We have received, as I am sure all Deputies have, many submissions on the Bill, even after the pre-legislative scrutiny concluded, and there seems to be an attempt to get it through as quickly as possible. We agreed that the amendments deadline, which was yesterday, should not usually fall before Second Stage but, in fairness, the Joint Committee on Justice has examined and dealt with more legislation than any other committee. While it is not exactly on all fours with the Bill, there were recently some disturbing events in my constituency where certain elements have claimed that there are examples of no-go areas in the county and suggested gardaí have said this. Senior members of An Garda Síochána have stated this is rubbish and totally untrue, yet a number of people have contacted me about it, some of whom are perhaps naive while others are not so. The agenda of these content creators who trade in hate is to divide communities and stir up tensions. As for the Bill, we support its intent and our primary concern is for it to strike the right balance. Submissions from the likes of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, and academics from the University of Limerick have sought clarity on a number of areas within it. There seems to be a difficulty, according to some of the submissions we received, with the definition of ""hatred"", perhaps suggesting the definition as outlined will act as a sort of a stalking horse inviting amendments on a later Stage, and I think it will probably be amended at some stage. It seems to be circular as defining “hatred” as hatred towards a group or individual based on protected characteristics, and perhaps this needs to be fleshed out at a later stage. While I understand the need for a simple definition, there are alternatives, and the ICCL recommended that this definition be replaced by one provided by the Council of Europe’s European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance and endorsed by the UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. That definition states:Hatred shall mean a state of mind characterised as intense and irrational emotions of opprobrium, enmity and detestation towards the target group.Of course, we believe in the fundamental right to free speech, but this core right should not be allowed to be abused to incite hate, prejudice or violence against others. Freedom of speech is not a one-way street, and the vulnerable must be protected and feel that they are safe and protected. No one has the right to shout ""Fire!"" in a crowded theatre. The Bill, as outlined by the Minister, contains three major provisions, namely, creating the new offence of incitement to hatred, making the denial or gross trivialisation of genocide a crime and creating aggravated versions of the existing offences where hatred was a motivating factor. It represents a major reform of existing laws and amounts to a single statute for crimes relating to hatred. I commend all the work that has taken place on this. A single statute on hate crime is something we support in principle. It can go some way towards offering a proper means of recourse for those who have suffered as a result of hate crime. Nevertheless, we need to be careful about using the criminal law without addressing the root causes of prejudice in society. A concurrent action plan on reducing hate crime is required and should be prioritised by the Departments of Justice and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. At a general level, inequality also fuels prejudice and there must be a wider effort to address poor housing, unemployment and inadequate healthcare. These failures affect working people no matter whether they are born here or are fleeing Russian aggression in Ukraine or discrimination and war in other parts of the world. We have a long and proud record of opposing divisions in this Republic. We want to build an island free of divisions of any type and we stand for all workers and families no matter what else is said. The rationale and grounds for the inclusion or exclusion of aggravated offences should be clarified as the Bill moves through the House. A defence of free expression, as outlined, is in principle a good idea but, again, there must a clear definition. The notion of a contribution towards discourse can be subjective - one person's hate speech can be another person's debate - and the subjectivity of what constitutes a fair remark may be difficult to ascertain in practice. What consequences the criminalisation of the distribution of materials may have on free speech should also be clarified. Indeed, we need clarity on whether there is a fallback within the legislation where a non-aggravated version of the crime has taken place if a jury finds the hate element has not been proven. The general provision on hatred as an aggravating factor should, perhaps, also be amended, as has been recommended, to include presumed membership of the protected group. In terms of policy provisions backing the implementation of the Bill, the use of restorative justice in these offences should be examined. Judging by some work carried out in the North of Ireland, many victims simply want to avoid a repeat of the bad behaviour, and restorative justice may be appropriate in those circumstances. This will avoid some of the inevitable issues that will arise from the use of criminal law to combat prejudice; it cannot be done on its own. The consequences of conviction for an offence are, of course, serious. It is arguable that although many of the Bill’s provisions envisage that cases will be prosecuted in the District Court, a conviction in respect of hate crime should be taken only in the clearest circumstances and should not be clarified as a minor offence fit to be tried summarily. Another criticism of the Bill relates to the equating of offences, and the Minister spoke at length about the demonstrable side of things. Some criticism has come from academics in regard to equating the offences without motive with those that were planned in advance. For example, under section 18, if a person, at the time of the offence or immediately before or after doing so, demonstrates hatred and if that hatred is on account of presumed membership of a group, there is a demonstration test. This has come under some criticism from academics, which is all the more reason the allegation in cases should consider education and de-escalation along with addressing the general inequalities in having a role to play in delivering justice. That is not to excuse what is said in the heat of the moment, but equating the types of offences has been criticised given the serious consequences. The justice system must ensure it will not create any further divisions. I look forward to moving amendments on Committee and Report Stages and hope we will be allowed further time for a full debate."	spk_336
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-11-09	dail	33	Long Covid Health Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I thank the Regional Group for bringing forward this motion. We in Sinn Féin will support it. The various issues which accompany long Covid have yet to be properly researched and identified. There is no doubt but that many have caught the disease, many of whom I know, and continue to suffer. Some 90%, I think, who have it continue to suffer. Their lives are on hold and many of the up to 200,000 people suffering from it are suffering in silence. The Regional Group is right to highlight the waiting list figures from the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the 79,000 people on those lists and the further 625,000 or more awaiting an outpatient appointment, and the difficulties the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation have outlined. I also draw attention to the acute hospital in Kerry, University Hospital Kerry, which is at breaking point. If we do not have confidence in the Government to deal with issues of health, housing and even direct provision, how can we have any confidence that it will deal with this issue properly? As for the hospital in Kerry, more damning information emerged recently. In July, August and September of this year, admission through University Hospital Kerry's accident and emergency department was far above the State average 12-hour waiting time. The most alarming statistic was probably that for over-75s. In July, there was a 22-hour waiting time. Although things improved somewhat in August and September, for all patients there was a waiting time of 15 hours in those months. In that same period, 28% of all patients in the hospital in Kerry had to wait over 24 hours to be admitted. Performance, once patients are admitted, is poor also, with wait times exceeding three days both for those aged over 75 and under 75 years for all three months of that quarter. The winter plan is no more than a smokescreen as the real work, the planning, should have been done over a multi-year period. This motion goes some way towards addressing those issues, and I hope the Deputies in the House, in particular Deputies from Kerry, will support it. There is also a difficulty and a crisis in home care, which has been brewing for many's the year. In my region there are 651 people waiting for home care, a gap that is often filled by relatives and friends. We need a proactive, strategic approach to workforce planning across all healthcare.	spk_38
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-10-26	dail	33	Domestic Violence	dbsect_3	The sample audit for north Kerry child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, is due either this week or next week. In my view, the HSE must expand the sample audit to a full review of all files in north Kerry, going back 15 years, as a matter of urgency. As the Minister of State knows, the Maskey report found that significant harm was caused to 46 children in south Kerry and that a further 240 were placed at risk of serious harm. Since that report was published, I have spoken to social workers, parents, patients and former patients. I spoke to a social worker who expressed concern about the supervision of children when there was no consultant psychiatric cover. The social worker told me that requests were made for a review of children who attended CAMHS from 2005 to 2015, when a consultant psychiatrist was eventually appointed. The concerns that she raised at that time were not addressed. The social worker told me that many children were placed on strong psychotropic medication, with poor follow-up. That was not even in Kerry but in another county. Some parents may even be unaware that their children were under the care of CAMHS because it happened prior to the HSE taking over in 2014. I spoke to the parents of a child in the north Kerry area who is now in his mid-20s. He was a promising sports player but does not leave the house now. He suffered huge weight gain. His life has been destroyed. He was later told by another doctor that there was really not much wrong with him that justified that treatment and overmedication. Parents who were desperate to get help for their children trusted doctors but were let down. Their agony must not be prolonged by any more indecision and delays. The Minister of State called for a full review but that has not happened. I am repeating the call for a full review. On the heels of the Maskey report, we were told that there are reports that the medical practitioner at the centre of south Kerry CAMHS may have been assigned to north Kerry CAMHS patients. That was reported by RTÉ. The sample audit of the north Kerry CAMHS patients was announced eight months ago. The scope was limited to a sample of 10% of current patients or about 50 cases. That sample audit was not enough then, as we said then and are saying again now. The history of overmedication, no supervision, poor governance and lack of clinical oversight predates the HSE taking over in 2014. I hear that complaints were made by social workers about poor follow-up in the Cork area from 2010 to 2012. I also am concerned that south Kerry families are being let down. They are not receiving therapies that they were promised and some therapies that were received were only online. Despite requests from me to the Minister for Health and the HSE to extend the sample audit to a full review of all north Kerry CAMHS patients over the past 15 years, the HSE has rigidly adhered to the sample audit. I repeat my call to the Minister of State. The consequences for children, many of whom are now adults, are far too serious for anything other than a full review.	spk_2
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-10-26	dail	33	Domestic Violence	dbsect_3	I thank the Minister of State for her reply. The only problem is that some of these families have been waiting 15 years since the misdiagnoses and the overprescribing of antipsychotic medication to their children. They are suffering internally in their family units and their children are still suffering as a result of what happened. The random sample, I believe, will lead only to a look-back. At least 25 families have come to my office to ask that they be included in the north Kerry review. Unless there is a huge proportion of people coming into my office, which is highly unlikely, a full review will be necessary. It was announced eight months ago. It was supposed to have been published within six months. That has not happened. It is supposed to be announced this week. That is the latest I have been told. I was told that about a week ago. It is not happening. The families are getting more frustrated and the status of patients who were treated pre-2016 is still up in the air. The south Kerry difficulties dealt with a specific period from 2016 onward, but the Minister of State and I know that the problems were there before the HSE took over the Brothers of Charity Services in 2014, going back 15 or 16 years. Some of those patients are now in their mid-20s and are still suffering, so they are getting increasingly frustrated by what they see as inaction. Their problems will continue. A full look back is inevitable, in my view, because this is continuing and because it is so serious. I ask the Minister of State to look into this - I know that she has called for it herself already - and to push the HSE into doing what will inevitably have to be done.	spk_4

Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-10-25	dail	33	Finance Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_12	The test of any budget is whether the lives of the people of the State will be improved as a result. In the context of tax measures, there was a need for a reduction in USC but that was not delivered. We see zero-rating of certain VAT products. That is welcome. Hopefully, the savings will be passed on, most crucially, to workers and to the guests staying there. In terms of transport, the measures are unfair on those under financial pressure. A further tax increase will affect Kerry residents who have to drive to work or use solid fuel for heating and does little for those least able to pay. Now is not the time to increase costs. In housing and facilities, we see an increase of 7% in the amount allocated to water services and capital spend is up from €876 million to €932 million. The Right2Water movement was clear on the need to pay for water services from general taxation, something the Government was eventually forced to accept. However, the Government is being dragged kicking and screaming towards Sinn Féin housing policy in circumstances where rents, house prices and homelessness are increasing. The eviction ban is welcome but belated. There is a type of rent tax credit, but we needed a rent increase ban. We also need more social housing to combat the years of austerity. Some of the programmes behind the overall spending allocation are incredibly important to Kerry's future. One of those is the rural water programme. According to the budget, this additional funding is being made available to support a new programme for water services for villages not on the public network. This is a massive issue in Kerry because many parishes do not enjoy proper wastewater services, access to a public water network or properly treated drinking water. Places like Glenbeigh, Castlegregory, Annascaul and Abbeydorney will not see any new developments of housing - affordable, social or otherwise. An extra €5 million is simply not enough under the scheme. In addition, there are bodies of water in Kerry suffering from discharges. A recent Environmental Protection Agency report stated that a number of waterways in Kerry face a severe biodiversity challenge, with one third above moderate levels of pollution. This is not good enough and I have called for Irish Water to carry out assessments in Cromane, the Maharees, Tralee Bay, Valentia and the Kenmare River. I welcome the €3 million provided to meet requirements under EU water quality directives but it is not enough. Major capital investment is needed to solve the issue, especially in water treatment plants. I call on the Government to ensure this is completed in Kerry as soon as possible. I had a conversation with a butcher from Kerry today who said he paid 11 cent per unit of electricity in 2019, 19 cent in 2020 and is currently paying 40 cent per unit. He is paying €4,000 per month and has a skeleton crew working six days per week. Every customer is affected, as are the 30 butchers in his craft butchers' section. What he wants, has asked for and needs is a cap on energy prices. He does not want the type of smart answers we got from the Taoiseach today during Leaders' Questions.	spk_258
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-10-19	dail	33	Mother and Baby Institutions Redress Scheme: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	"I thank the Social Democrats for tabling the motion. I also acknowledge all the work that the Minister has done over the past number of years in this regard. The issues with the report, the redress scheme and access to testimony and other data are well known at this point. The fact that claims are still based on length of time rather than the degree of abuse or other factors is worrying. The most recent revelation regarding the pharmaceutical tests is also worrying. Those horrific practices have been part of the recent past too. We remember that the organs of dead babies were sold off to pharmaceutical companies without the consent of the parents not too long ago. According to the Tusla report in 2020, there were 69,000 referrals to child protection and welfare services that year. There were 5,882 children in care at that time with 90% in foster care and 450 in residential care, yet recently in the budget there was no increase of any significant amount for the foster carers who shore up the system and keep it afloat. The State has a duty to all those who by accident of birth found or find themselves in desperate circumstances. I also want to refer to - and the students who are here from the Intermediate School in Killorglin will be interested to hear about - the boarded-out children. I mention two boys, James and Michael Sugrue, who were left at the mercy of the State and suffered horrendous childhoods. They were boarded out from the county home in Killarney, County Kerry. James was aged eight and Michael was seven. The State had a duty of care to these children but sent them to work and allowed them to work in servitude. ""You are here to work"", they were told. They were sent to a house that had no lighting and no heating. They were not properly fed. There were not adequate inspections. James said he was physically and sexually abused over many years. He was then failed by social workers. His school and Kerry County Council declined him a grant for further education. That is the legacy of the State. James went to Hammersmith and made a life for himself in England but Michael was not so fortunate. He suffered with addiction and mental health issues and was found dead in Crystal Palace, south London in 1993.  Later in life, James was forgotten by every redress system. He was not recognised and was denied a full Garda investigation. At every hand’s turn, he was told, ""There is nothing we can do."" There is still no apology and nothing for those children who were boarded out. Having listened to James, why is he still being ignored? Back in January 2021, the Minister said that people have waited too long for recognition. He stated:... the State will engage with empathy, humility and generosity with those who were wronged [and] will strive to rebuild the trust so grievously shattered.James is asking still to this day to put an end to this ""eternal atonement"", as he calls it, and an end to the turbulence in his life."	spk_30

I thank the staff in the Bills Office and the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for their assistance. Particular thanks are due to the Office of Parliamentary Advisers, OPLA, and Niamh McKenna, who helped me tease out the considerable legal issues involved while preserving the policy intent of the Bill. I will share time with my colleagues, Deputies Paul Donnelly and Cronin, who are co-signing the Bill. Nobody questions the importance of the system of Garda vetting introduced in the 2012 Act. It is an important measure to protect children and vulnerable adults in combination with other safeguarding measures. Garda vetting is used in many professional and voluntary contexts in both paid and voluntary roles. I am sure many in this House have engaged with it for local sports clubs and voluntary organisations. It helps organisations and companies feel confident in the people they hire and enables compliance with legal obligations where sensitive work or vulnerable people are involved. However, the system is burdensome for many, especially when volunteers find themselves having to be vetted by multiple organisations, even with no criminal record. It puts people off. This Bill sets out to provide a register of generalised consents, particularly where a number of vetting applications have to be made. It allows an individual to apply for inclusion on this register and will allow approved organisations for judo, for example, and the GAA and HSE to vet the individual without having to complete the full process every time. Ideally, we will look at the general review. I urge the Government to look at adopting the Bill's provisions or instituting a full review of vetting legislation.	spk_148

Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-10-11	dail	33	Disability Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_14	I also congratulate Deputy Tully on all her work in bringing this motion forward. I want to raise two issues. The first is an urgent matter regarding the lump-sum payments arising out of the budget. It is my understanding that those in receipt of the partial capacity benefit will not receive the lump sum of €500, which has been announced for carers, those with invalidity pensions and disability allowances. This is very unfair, given that the people in receipt of this benefit are in many cases, by definition, moderately, severely or profoundly restricted. It makes no sense given that people in receipt of carer's support grant or disability allowance are able to work and will get the lump sum, as will families on the working family payment, but it appears that those on partial capacity benefit will not be able to claim the working family payment. This is a very vulnerable cohort, and, according to contacts within the Department, they seem to be losing out. This matter must be resolved as soon as possible. The other issue I would like to raise is the case of Alexis O'Mahony from Killarney. I have raised it here previously. This is my third or fourth time raising it. Alexis O'Mahony is a six-year old girl who lives in Killarney. She has a number of conditions and injuries. She needs constant care from her family, which includes constant turning and daily washing to avoid bed sores. This takes a tremendous physical toll on her family. A ceiling hoist would be of great assistance to the family. They applied for the grant from the local authority. However, nothing has happened, other than the Department's fiddling. The Government's policy changed and while the structural works needed for the hoist are covered by the local authority, the equipment for the ceiling track hoist is not covered. It is a matter of dispute as to who exactly is responsible for the funding and providing the equipment between the Department of Health and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. I do not care whose responsibility it is, but someone must sort this out as soon as possible. The budget has been given to those who need it the most, but it is not happening with Alexis O'Mahony. The family has been repeatedly in contact with the Department, yet no resolution is forthcoming. I have raised the matter four times. I ask the Minister to intervene and sort the matter out.	spk_246
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-10-04	dail	33	Housing for All Update: Statements	dbsect_10	I spoke to the housing officer in Kerry a fortnight ago who told me that three families in Kerry are becoming homeless every week. That is three families who have, by and large, been in rented accommodation for the past ten, 12 or 15 years and now face going into one room in a homeless shelter before they can get somewhere else, if they can get somewhere else. The housing crisis in Kerry is, similar to most of the country, at breaking point. We have sky-high rents. They were 15.4% higher in quarter 1 of this year compared with last year. Rents are 100% up on the lowest point since the crash. In Crystal Fountain, a former holiday home development in Tralee, the rent is €1,300 per month, which is what people would pay in a middle-class area of Leeds. Rents in new city centre, premium apartments in Deansgate in Manchester are €1,100. That is the level the rents in a rural town in the west of Ireland have reached. There is little or no ability for first-time buyers to get on the ladder and a long social housing waiting list of up to 14 years. Many people are falling foul of the social housing limits to which there has been no change. In the case of one Kerry family that dealt with, their weekly income was €25 under the limit but, because their oldest child who is a dependant moved in with her grandmother, their income is now back over the social housing income threshold, which has not increased since 2011. They will be denied social housing. This family is about to made homeless because they have been given a notice to quit. The high spike in notices to quit since the restrictions is no coincidence because renters are now the victims of price gouging. Landlords know they can charge what they want. We need action to undermine the hold they have over renters. First-time buyers are also facing in to the headwinds of this 	spk_184

The Minister of State will surely agree that people with blood cancers should be treated as close to home as possible, especially as they require multiple visits to hospital. Basic services, however, such as bone marrow testing, cannot be done in Tralee. Therefore, I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the haematology day ward will be opened. The provision of ten beds or chairs would do to establish that unit. Additionally, the isolator which ensures that chemotherapy products are prepared and dispensed in a sterile environment in Cork University Hospital was inoperable for a fortnight recently. This resulted in essential, stressful treatments being deferred for all the people with those difficulties in the south-west region. One machine should be provided in UHK so the hospitals can work together. Most importantly, laboratory staff must be recruited. The current complement of two haematologists is not enough. Critically, if the laboratory - which must be accredited by the accreditation board - is lost, the provision of major services in areas such as maternity, surgery, medical care and accident and emergency will not be able to go ahead.	spk_185

Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-09-20	dail	33	Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment) Bill 2022: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_9	We support the Bill and some of the amendments, which are worthwhile. I want to take this opportunity to raise a number of issues. No dentist in County Kerry will take on medical card patients at the moment. There was one in Killorglin but the staff were so overwhelmed with requests from across the county that they had to stop taking new patients. I was particularly struck by the case of a man who came to me. He had been working abroad for approximately 30 years. He came home needing to have a crown fixed and he expected the same level of healthcare that he had in the country from where he had come to retire. He was staggered that even though he had a medical card, he was not able to get that service. He was searching around the Ring of Kerry, looking for a dentist, and he could not get one. He came to me and I had to pull a favour from a dentist I knew to get him the treatment he so urgently needed. That is not acceptable. As the Minister knows, there has been a haemorrhage of dentists from the dental treatment services scheme because the services covered are insufficient to provide dental care and the reimbursement rates are so low that dentists are losing money and it is costing them more to keep the practice going than they receive for treating a patient. The number of dentists holding these contracts nationwide had been in excess of 1,000; it declined from 1,600 in 2017 and now only 600 dentists throughout the country are actively treating medical card patients. Primary school dental check-ups are running two to three years behind schedule, which means children with orthodontic needs are delayed getting on the waiting lists. The dental clinics in Kerry have treatment waiting lists that are five years long and orthodontists are coming into the county to provide treatment. The physical and emotional harm being inflicted on young people as they wait while their teeth get worse during puberty is unacceptable. What is the Government doing, in particular for Kerry, to ensure there is at least one dentist taking on medical card holders in each local electoral area? Earlier this week, I met with members of the INTO regarding their pre-budget submissions and one of their four main demands stood out, which related to mental health support for pupils. Other speakers have mentioned the necessity for therapies and psychological services to be made available in primary schools, where children can be seen without having the stigma of having to leave the school or the classroom to go to see a psychologist or speech and language therapist on the other side of town, if they eventually get that service. I was informed that the number of primary schools referred to CAMHS and other services rose 40% during the pandemic. Special education teachers are trying to act as a stopgap to perform the task. Early intervention therapies in schools are working but more help is needed. With regard to the pandemic bonus payment, staff are still waiting ten months on from when the promise was made who are working privately in the public system. It shows the level of two-tier unfairness in the system that they are still waiting at this late stage for their payment. What is being done to sort that out?	spk_293
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-09-14	dail	33	Measures to Assist with Household Bills: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_21	This motion aims to assist people with their household bills. We need to reduce the costs and put money back in people's pockets. The last straw was the latest round of announcements on electricity prices going up from 27% to 34%. For many, that was the straw that broke the camel's back, in addition to mortgages and back-to-school costs. I spoke last week with a large employer of 130 employees in County Kerry. He showed me his electricity bills. The difference between January 2019 and January 2020 was a 35% increase. In February it was 36% and in March it was down to 31%, but in April and May it was back up to a 78% and 70% increase, respectively. The manager told me that in his 25 years in the business this is the most uncertain time that he has ever faced going forward. He has no control over costs, and even though he has adopted every cost-saving measure throughout his building, as he is in the hospitality sector, he wants to deliver a service that reflects good things about County Kerry. He needs all the help and support that is available. We have heard a lot about people in their own homes and the increased costs of €1,000 in their electricity bills. The refusal of the Government to bring forward an emergency budget before the summer recess left people on their own. The refusal of the Minister, acting on behalf of the Government, to reform the electricity market, has already been mentioned. It would have reduced the bills of households and businesses sooner. We need to cut household electricity bills. We must cap them at 2021 prices. We need to introduce cash payments, a double child benefit payment and a windfall tax. The manager also gave me a list of all the different increases ranging from food prices to his rates bill. We have heard about gougers earlier. The biggest gougers in the country are in the insurance industry. In 2020 and in 2021, in the middle of Covid, his insurance bill was €65,000 and €67,000, but the insurance industry has reared its ugly head again and his insurance bill for the year is €160,000. On top of everything else, there is a real threat that it will put him out of business. We have tried to introduce measures. The old reliables - the usual suspects - are getting away with it, but they have been joined now. We must act soon - in the budget - to reduce the costs for everyone.	spk_318

Some 2,355 are waiting for treatment, 1,800 of whom have now been waiting for longer than two years, while 177 have been waiting longer than four years. I recently came across the case of a constituent, a teenager, who continued to wear a mask to school because they were so embarrassed about their treatment. That child is in sixth year in school.

Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-07-12	dail	33	Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund: Motion	dbsect_24	"The invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 has led to a mass influx of displaced persons to several EU member states. This has placed renewed pressure on the financial resources of the member states to deal with migration and border management needs.The increased pressure is already being felt across member states that share a land border with Ukraine and the needs have been spreading further afield. The overall objective of this proposal, as the Minister said, is to support member states to address the consequences of war in Ukraine by facilitating access to unspent financial resources. Council implementing decision No. 382 of 2022 was adopted, ""establishing the existence of a massed influx of displaced persons from Ukraine within the meaning of Article 5 of Directive 2001/55/EC, and having the effect of introducing temporary protection"". This implementing decision has clarified that the efforts of member states to comply with their obligations and offer temporary protection will be supported by the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund. I want to address a few issues in regard to the White Paper on ending direct provision, which was introduced in February 2021. At the time of its publication, the White Paper was long overdue and there was much anticipation and expectation that there would finally be meaningful reform of a broken system. It is disappointing, 18 months later, that little or no reform has been undertaken. We welcomed the White Paper at the time because direct provision is a shameful and cruel system that has caused serious harm to many asylum seekers and wider communities. We need a modern, humane system that is fit for purpose. The White Paper contained many positive proposals, which we welcomed, including alignment of welfare rates with existing benefits, the provision of driver's licences for asylum seekers and a reduction in the reliance on private operators, one of which had obtained, through direct provision, the sum of €400 million over a period of years. The White Paper emphasised the importance of care and supports and, crucially, proposed a non-adversarial approach to applicants. However, we pointed out at the time that the White Paper was lacking in ambition in a number of key areas. We asked that applicants be required to wait three months rather than six months before entering the labour market. We expressed disappointment at the granting of leave to remain for only five years for people who had been in the system more than two years. Many asylum seekers who were working in healthcare and food were anxious about facing deportation. In particular, we were concerned that the length of time people would remain in reception centres would be longer than four months if there was not a front-loading of capital investment in own-door accommodation and accelerated delivery of same. We were concerned about the White Paper's failure to address the growing problem of those with leave to remain who were trapped in direct provision. We called for greater supports to remove those families and ensure they were not subjected to entirely unnecessary and unfair delays. There have been many critics of the direct provision system over the years, including very highly qualified individuals and organisations focused on supporting asylum seekers. The Government has not listened closely enough to those people and has entrenched a system that has been known to fail in the past. Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, a former special rapporteur on child protection, has called for direct provision for be abolished, noting it is not a suitable long-term solution. It has been described by the Irish Refugee Council as ""already a chapter in Ireland's long and dark history of institutional living"". Using for-profit accommodation providers has only added to the cruelty of the system. The Irish Refugee Council has stated that any replacement for direct provision should offer ""own door accommodation, the opportunity to cook for oneself, to live in a community"". The Department of Justice, which had responsibility for the direct provision system at the time, introduced regulations in this regard in August 2019. In July 2022, however, we still see the same problems, with people not having their own accommodation, being unable to cook for themselves and not being part of a community. Three direct provision accommodation centres have been built in recent years. We all remember what happened when a large number of asylum seekers were moved into a former hotel in Cahersiveen, County Kerry. Approved housing bodies, AHBs, are clearly the best model, providing dignity and a sense of self and home and enabling asylum and refuge seekers to live a meaningful life. Any future policy that relies heavily on the private sector will repeat the mistakes of the past. I urge the Government not to repeat those mistakes. It is essential that it be transparent regarding the provision of all housing and the transition from the old direct provision model to any new system. Direct provision was supposed to be a short-term measure designed to house people for weeks, not years, but half of the children in the direct provision system in 2019 had been there for more than five years. At that time, the Children's Rights Alliance, Dr. Liam Thornton of University College Dublin, UCD, and the Irish Countrywomen's Association all argued that direct provision does not have the best interests of children at its core and is a violation of the rights of the child, and that there is a need for access to complementary services. Some of those concerns were met in the White Paper but, unfortunately, 18 months since its publication and three years after the concerns were raised, we are still seeing the use of accommodation centres in very isolated areas. Many of the asylum seekers who have come to my office say they are grateful to be in Ireland but that they quickly felt abandoned and lost in the system. They are concerned they have spent weeks and months waiting for answers via official channels. They do not have access to broadband, which makes it very expensive and stressful for them to communicate with Government bodies. All the while, they are receiving a very small amount of money from the State. Transportation to hospital or urgent appointments is also a very expensive proposition. They are reliant on Government resources such as the Tralee International Resource Centre, which provides invaluable help because there is nobody else to help them. Direct provision is, in general, provided in sub-par accommodation in which residents are expected to share bedrooms and bathrooms, with little concern for the reasons they sought asylum in the first place. Many of them feel isolated. A single pregnant woman was sent to rural Kerry, for example, with no consideration as to how she would travel to her prenatal appointments. The travel cost was more than her weekly allowance, meaning much of her care was forgone. The provision of counselling to help her cope with the reasons she was alone and pregnant in Ireland was not even an afterthought. Many residents of direct provision refer to problems with shared kitchen resources, where facilities are often closed early in the evening and food is lost or stolen. Families may be living three to six to a single room, with some people sleeping on the floor. There is no capacity for children to play games, draw, write or even learn how to eat sitting at a kitchen table with any consistency or pleasure. Complaints from residents are met with threats of deportation or removal to a different location. One person faced the prospect of being moved to a container in Athlone, away from any small stability or community the individual had managed to establish. We have not offered any respect for, or understanding of, people's culture but they must meet the expectations of our culture. I urge the Minister at this late stage not to use the private sector as much as has been the case. He should use the State bodies and AHBs because they offer the best model for providing dignity and a sense of self and home."	spk_526
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-07-06	dail	33	Cost of Disability: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	If ever there was a case which showed that the two-tier system of providing healthcare in Ireland, as well as the lack of Government dealing with an issue, it is the case of Alexis O’Mahony, who is a six-year-old girl living in Killarney. She has a pyruvate dehydrogenase, PDH, deficiency. She has a brain injury. She has cerebral palsy quadriplegia. She has visual impairment, the subluxation of her hip and a high risk of aspiration. Her family applied for a grant from the local authority. They were told that because of a Government decision a number of years ago, the local authority can fund the structural works in the rafters but cannot fund the equipment for a ceiling track hoist in order that she can be lifted. She needs daily washing and turning to avoid her getting bedsores. This is taking a massive physical toll on her family. In April 2021, they asked about this and were told that negotiations are ongoing between the Department of Health and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. They asked again in July and got the same answer. They asked again in October and got the same answer. In May of this year, we submitted a parliamentary question, to which I have the reply to hand on my phone. It starts off by saying that the HSE and the Government are committed to providing disability services. It concludes by saying that they will reply directly as soon as possible on whether she can be helped. There is still no reply. There has been no decision. Somebody needs to grasp the nettle on this. Negotiations are ongoing between various Departments. In the meantime, her family have to lift her and turn her five, six or seven times per day.  I commend the Social Democrats on tabling the motion to allow us to put extra pressure on the Government in this regard. This is an issue whereby people who are not directly affected and who can afford the extra €8,700 per year, as stated in the motion, come to my office and tell me that while they can afford it, an awful lot of people cannot and they would like to advocate on their behalf. This is therefore an issue whereby people are so upset by the lack of the development and the lack of services being provided to other people that they come to us to ask if we can help to sort them out. The case of Alexis O’Mahony shows that nothing is being done about it.  I note that the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, states that lone parents who cannot afford it, and working-age adults with disability have higher rates of poverty, deprivation and consistent poverty. They are more likely to have urgent housing needs. They are more likely to have intensive healthcare treatments and because of those costs they are falling behind. 	spk_30

It was that this is a pared-back piece of legislation. I do not agree with her that it is pared back. I mentioned proportionality earlier on. Under the 2011 Act, a request could be made in the case of a serious offence. This has not been pared back. Rather it has been expanded to ""an offence"". I am worried whether under the requirement in this legislation where a superintendent believes that data related to a person whom the member of An Garda Síochána suspects on reasonable grounds of having committed an offence relates to the protesters we see outside here every week, some of whom are campaigning for disability rights. Would that be a public order offence if a superintendent believes they were breaching the Public Order Act? What about someone campaigning for housing or about mica or pyrite? If a superintendent believes he or she was committing an offence, could the superintendent then make the application? It seems to me that under this legislation, the superintendent would be able to go to a service provider and ask it to disclose user data in respect of people committing those types of offences, possibly even a parking ticket because that is an offence. This is where I disagree with the Minister about the pared-back nature of it. The current system refers to a serious offence. Breaking a window is a serious offence because you will get five years for it in the Circuit Court. Stealing a Mars bar from a shop qualifies as a serious offence if it goes to the Circuit Court, which it can. This has been changed to ""an offence"", which is so wide-ranging that I would have to disagree with the Minister. This is not a pared-back piece of legislation."	spk_318

The reforms to GSOC contained in the policing, security and community safety Bill were dealt with extensively during pre-legislative scrutiny. The proposed reforms were criticised by many stakeholders in the committee. Some criticised the reforms for giving GSOC too many powers, and others criticised them for not giving it enough powers. I ask the Minister for her initial thoughts on the proposed reforms. The sustained increase in the caseload has also been highlighted as an issue. We in Sinn Féin believe it is important to get police accountability right. I think we can all accept the Six Counties jurisdiction has a lot to teach us on the matter. The powers of the ombudsman in the Bill do not exceed those necessary to conduct effective investigations of the police. I welcome what the Minister has said about members of An Garda Síochána no longer investigating other members of the organisation. It is a basic principle that members of the police service should not be investigating themselves. I note the work the Garda Commissioner has done with the anti-corruption unit. At the same time, there is a resourcing issue. That has been commented on by people within GSOC. I hope that will be dealt with by Government. There is also an ongoing lack of co-operation or collaboration on the part of middle management of An Garda Síochána. Does the Minister accept the principle of independent investigation is important?

I note the figure of 13,000 calls that the Minister mentioned, which is a small but significant increase. I do not know whether the Minister noticed the following matter but I certainly did and I am sure the Acting Chairman did. There has been a massive increase in the number of people seeking advice since the ban on evictions ended. There have been many notices to quit, which involve landlord and tenant law and employment law. There are much fewer people, percentage wise, who are in trade unions. They are not getting any representation, a lot of them cannot afford the services of a specialised lawyer and they are coming to our offices. Does the Minister have any plans to resource FLAC so it can move into advocacy on behalf of workers and tenants who are receiving notices to quit?

Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-07-05	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_19	I thank the Minister for her response. The reforms to GSOC contained in the policing, security and community safety Bill were dealt with extensively during pre-legislative scrutiny. The proposed reforms were criticised by many stakeholders in the committee. Some criticised the reforms for giving GSOC too many powers, and others criticised them for not giving it enough powers. I ask the Minister for her initial thoughts on the proposed reforms. The sustained increase in the caseload has also been highlighted as an issue. We in Sinn Féin believe it is important to get police accountability right. I think we can all accept the Six Counties jurisdiction has a lot to teach us on the matter. The powers of the ombudsman in the Bill do not exceed those necessary to conduct effective investigations of the police. I welcome what the Minister has said about members of An Garda Síochána no longer investigating other members of the organisation. It is a basic principle that members of the police service should not be investigating themselves. I note the work the Garda Commissioner has done with the anti-corruption unit. At the same time, there is a resourcing issue. That has been commented on by people within GSOC. I hope that will be dealt with by Government. There is also an ongoing lack of co-operation or collaboration on the part of middle management of An Garda Síochána. Does the Minister accept the principle of independent investigation is important? Will she ensure the resources will be put in place to deal with that? 	spk_197

We do not want to go back to the stage where there are units within An Garda Síochána doing investigations. We do not want to go back to the practices of the past, such as those used in the Sallins mail train robbery investigations, where the individuals involved were questioned and tortured. They have now launched a petition to the UN to investigate the State's role in the process. We must challenge ourselves to ensure such incidents never again occur.

I do not know whether the Minister noticed the following matter but I certainly did and I am sure the Acting Chairman did. There has been a massive increase in the number of people seeking advice since the ban on evictions ended. There have been many notices to quit, which involve landlord and tenant law and employment law. There are much fewer people, percentage wise, who are in trade unions. They are not getting any representation, a lot of them cannot afford the services of a specialised lawyer and they are coming to our offices. Does the Minister have any plans to resource FLAC so it can move into advocacy on behalf of workers and tenants who are receiving notices to quit?

As several speakers have noted, an annual review is not satisfactory. Three years ago, we called for a review of the system, which was granted. We need 21st century laws to tackle 21st century criminals. That encompasses everything, including increased Garda visibility on the streets and more resources and protection for those who are giving evidence against dangerous gangs. The powers granted under the Act are a departure from historic common law norms but we must ensure the Garda and the courts have the powers they need to take on organised crime. The former Minister, Deputy Flanagan, agreed to a review of the legislation and it is good news that the current Minister, Deputy McEntee, has established it. The purpose of the review is to take into account the current threat posed by terrorism. The Minister noted in her speech that an international terrorist threat is unlikely. The review seeks to deliver a criminal justice system that is both effective and fair. It will take into account our constitutional obligations and those arising out of decisions of the European Court of Human Rights. The chairman of the review group, Mr. Justice Peart, recently reported that the public consultation has concluded. I note the extremely low usage rate of the Offences against the State Act in the past year. There has been a total of some eight offences altogether this year, whereas, back in 2002, 115 cases were taken under section 9 alone. It is simply not right, as noted in a court case last year, that a civil servant should have the power to refer cases unchallenged to the Special Criminal Court without any reason or explanation. In one instance, a prosecution was tried in the ordinary courts and, when a retrial occurred, it was dealt with in the Special Criminal Court. There have been a lot of difficulties with the court over the past year. In that particular case, I understand there was no evidence of any jury intimidation. However, the DPP was able to make the decision to have it prosecuted in the Special Criminal Court. The review group is highly respected. I hope it will have brought forward proposals for improvement by this time next year and that the Government will then introduce legislation. We want to work with the Government to bring about necessary change and improvement. There is no doubt we can improve on what is there, which it is the job of legislators to do. I do not see how laws that were crafted nearly 100 years ago, in the 1930s, can possibly be fit for purpose in the 21st century. Considering the cyberattack on the HSE last year and the rise of international criminal groups, which have become more sophisticated as they have consolidated, it is obvious our laws need to be improved. We all want the same thing, which is to ensure we have safer, vibrant communities. Our job as legislators is to put the tools in the hands of the Garda and the courts to make that happen.	spk_122
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-06-29	dail	33	Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2022: Report and Final Stages	dbsect_25	I move amendment No. 1:In page 10, lines 23 and 24, to delete “or, in the English language, the Judicial Appointments Commission (in this Act referred to as the “Commission”)” and substitute “(in this Act referred to as the “Most of the amendments Deputy Ó Snodaigh submitted are straightforward attempts to ask the Government to live up to commitments under the recently passed Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021. It is disappointing that the amendments related to the Irish language were rejected on Committee Stage and the Government is not bringing forward any amendments of its own on Report Stage. This contrasts with the position of the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who engaged on Committee Stage. They met Conradh na Gaeilge in recent weeks and discussed how to improve the Higher Education Authority Bill 2022 and the Electoral Reform Bill 2022, respectively, to ensure that Irish is to the fore in both Bills.However, the Department of Justice appears to have an approach unlike the rest of the Government and does not seem interested in implementing Government policy on the promotion of Irish. Even at this stage I ask the Minister to reconsider and accept the amendments or at least perhaps commit to meeting representatives of Conradh na Gaeilge and Deputy Ó Snodaigh with a view to introducing Government amendments in the Seanad. With regard to amendment No. 1, there are examples in Córas Iompair Éireann, Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Bord na Móna and Bord Gáis and many others of public bodies given Irish names only. Such an approach is successful in building a strong Gaelic identity for the State, whose first official language is Irish. Normalising Irish words among the public is useful as part of revival efforts for the language. I have mentioned road signs, and prominence should be accorded to the Irish language version of place names and logainmneacha. We also know from discussions with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, about the Higher Education Authority, HEA, that a public body will anglicise its name at any opportunity, and that is hard to undo once the English name has entered general parlance. The HEA's only legal name is An tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas but the Act establishing it was known as the Higher Education Authority Act, so the body renamed itself. We proposed on Committee Stage that neither An Coimisiún um Cheapacháin Bhreithiúnacha nor An Oifig an Choimisiúin um Cheapacháin Bhreithiúnacha need an English name. This should be the Coimisiún um Cheapacháin Bhreithiúnacha Bill and not the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill. The response from the Department acknowledged that the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 specifies that new bodies should be as Gaeilge only but argues that it would set a precedent in doing this when the Act is not yet commenced. In summary, the argument was that it would do the right thing but it would be wrong to start doing the right thing now. I do not know if St. Augustine said something like that at some stage. A Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Noonan, saw no problem setting that precedent with An Coimisiún Toghcháin in the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 and we now know from another Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, that the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 has been commenced and has been formally adopted as Government policy. The provisions of that Act did not seem to be required when we consider the history of RTÉ, CIE etc., which were set up as public bodies long before the Act. I ask the Minister to consider accepting amendments Nos. 1 and 5.	spk_217

Sinn Féin is also proposing that for the very top level, the Supreme Court, all judges appointed should be able to practise bilingually. This is, of course, because Irish is a necessary skill for that job. Supreme Court judges are charged with interpreting the text of the Constitution, which is not only bilingual but also states categorically that the Irish text is the authoritative version. There are significant differences between this text and the English translations. We are demanding that judges in charge of interpreting the law should be able to read it.

However, its stance on the cost-of-living issues demonstrates it is not fit to govern, with the leaders of the three parties last week jostling for position on what action would be taken, if any, and when. This lack of decisiveness is costing ordinary families and communities dearly and nowhere more so than in Killarney, Listowel, Tralee and around County Kerry. The county is already disadvantaged by peripherality as it has three peninsulas, work that is both precarious and seasonal, and services that are farther away than those in nearly all other counties. A dire choice is faced by many, that is, either work and lose money or stay at home and face a future that is just as uncertain. It goes without saying living standards are under threat, but basic security and physical and mental well-being are of the utmost concern. Even when people fall through the social safety net, there is less there, or nothing, to catch them. Emergency accommodation in Kerry is now effectively full. I ask the Minister of State and the Government to act urgently and introduce an emergency budget. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic are cited by the Government as reasons for the increases in everyday prices. The Russian invasion was even mentioned by the Taoiseach as causing all the increased anxiety in the country. However, this Government and previous Governments cannot escape their own culpability. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil policies over the past ten years, going back to the financial crisis and the economic policies pursued since, have led to this. They ceased to build social housing and outsourced it to private landlords, abolished the town councils and introduced direct provision. Look how much the outsourcing of direct provision has cost over the years, with nothing now to show for it. There are six to one room in the new accommodation in Killarney. With no public control over investment or capital, the private sector has run rampant and is looking for a return on areas such as homes and housing. This has been encouraged by the Government, and while it is a bed the Government has made, it is the ordinary people who are forced to lie in it.	spk_261

Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-06-22	dail	33	Insurance Reform: Statements	dbsect_11	"When I see the Government coming back with new proposals I am reminded of Jack's mother when he came back from the market with three magic beans after selling the family's cow. This is the thing that is going to solve all our problems with the insurance industry. I worked in the courts for a few years. There was a judge from Athlone who used to say, when he thought that somebody was spoofing or not telling the truth: ""When you are in a hole, stop digging"". However, what happens with the insurance companies is that the Government seems to tell them: ""Keep talking, we want to hear it"". For 40 years, since insurance was made mandatory, the insurance industry has made promises. It stated that if senior counsel were removed from cases, premiums would go down; if juries were removed from courts, premiums would go down; if the PIAB was introduced, premiums would go down and if the guidelines were introduced, premiums would go down. It was interesting to hear the Minister of State say, with regard to claims, that the cost of premiums reduced by 10.9%. However, that was after lockdown. As some of my colleagues said, the cost of premiums has gone up over the last decade while the number of claims has reduced by 25%. I do not believe a word the insurance industry says. I would listen more to some of the people I have represented in court than to some of the representatives of the insurance industry. It is worth going through some of the various initiatives the Government is taking which are supposed to reduce premiums. I do not believe they ever will. Action has long been required but there is little doubt that over the last almost 50 years, particularly since 1976, the Government has failed in its attempts to bring the industry to heel. With regard to personal injury awards, a long and detailed process was undertaken by the Government. An action plan for insurance reform was the result, with 66 actions. They included reform of PIAB and reducing recourse to litigation. When dealing with insurance companies, and I dealt with many of them over the years, they often speak about material damage. Without having consulted with their clients who had taken out the insurance policy, companies decided to settle claims anyway regardless of what one said. It is easier, more efficient and cheaper for them to settle the claim despite what the client says. They do not care about the consumer or about people in general. The implementation report of the action plan published in March has confirmed that the measures have had their intended effect. It states:Average awards for motor insurance dropped from €22,158 in 2020 to €12,592 – a drop of 43%. [A drop of nearly half, as the Minister, Deputy McEntee, said.] Public Liability awards fell from €26,000 in 2020 to €14,776 at the end of October – again a drop of 43%. A similar reduction of 43% was experienced in the employer liability category – from €30,576 to €17,441.However, did we see a similar drop in insurance premiums? No, and we never will. Some lawyers warned that the insurance industry would continue to set premiums as it wished despite the reduction in awards, and they were right. The insurance industry proceeded to do exactly that. It pockets the difference and drives up its profits. The amazing thing during lockdown was that the number of claims collapsed due to lockdown. What has happened since then? There is a paltry 10% reduction. When people pointed to the reduction in the amount of claims, the industry had another excuse. It stated it had to wait for the ones in the system to come through. That is rubbish. It is very telling that the Government proceeded down this path despite the industry and lobbyists offering no guarantee at all that the premiums would be reduced. They came back with other excuses. Saying they may do it over time is as much as the Government is going to get. They were not red-faced, unlike poor old Jack when he came back from the market.Civil law reforms are now coming in. I notice that the Government is taking the majority decision regarding litigation costs. The majority of the group that was set up said that it would be more fair and more consumer-friendly than the minority view, but because the insurance companies say it is the fault of the lawyers and everybody else - it is never their fault - that decision has been taken. It will not work. The action plan will set out other reforms. Perjury is now a statutory offence. Perjury and false and exaggerated claims have all been highlighted over the years, not by consumers but by the insurance industry. The number of fraudulent claims is massively exaggerated. Everybody knows that. We have all heard the scare stories of the shenanigans but it is tiny minority of overall claimants. Insurance companies poured massive resources into catching fraudulent claimants, including the use of private investigators. However, they already use private investigators when there is a genuine claim. Where people were passengers in cars and were very seriously injured, they engage insurance investigators, people who traditionally have great access to information coming from various sources through their contacts, all in an attempt to denigrate the genuine claimants as well as the other ones. There is a specialised Garda unit, and it is my understanding that there is a significant difference between the insurance industry's estimates of the number of uninsured drivers and how many are out there in the Garda's direct experience. I am aware of that from speaking to members of the Garda myself. All that is to say that there is very much the means and will to catch fraudulent claims, but we do not see a decrease in premiums. The industry has to be dragged kicking and screaming time and again into reform. Particular groups are facing a lack of options within the market and the office to promote competition in the insurance market needs to examine all the options to assist them, including subvention. The ultimate solution may perhaps even be direct State involvement in insurance."	spk_155

Domestic violence shelter provision is perhaps the most glaring example, though I commend the Minister's personal passion for this type of activity and hope it continues into the future. She informed the justice committee not long ago that the Department would be examining the establishment of services directly, which will address the dearth of places around the country. Direct involvement by the Department would be most welcome, rather than outsourcing to anybody else. The proposal at least sets out minimum standards regarding certain offences, although crimes against women are not crimes as set out within the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Strictly an approach of criminalisation will not work and provision of shelters will be key. More broadly, access to decent employment, social protection payments, housing, childcare and wrap-around services, as evidenced by Catherine Casey and her team in Tralee, all help. When women can access the resources, they are less dependent on abusive partners, so the Government's responsibilities in those areas are crucial for vulnerable populations and people such as abuse victims. Sinn Féin's Organisation of Working Time (Domestic Violence Leave) Bill 2020 was crucial in this respect and prompted the Government to move its own legislation in the area. The Bill enjoys broad support across parties and in the NGO sector. Women's rights are workers' rights and  Another area I am glad to see being addressed is the collection of data on violence against women. We just spoke on this in the justice committee. The collection of data in relation to sexual offences and violence is most important. That should be moved on and improved. The deficit in that is pronounced across the EU but is especially troubling in Ireland. 	spk_190
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-06-21	dail	33	Our Lady's Hospital Navan Emergency Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_16	I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion and thank my colleagues from County Meath for enabling it. The downgrading of services is well known to people in Munster. I encourage people from the Meath area to look at what happened in Ennis and Nenagh, where there was a downgrading of services, staff shortages, the closure of units and the promise of a centre of excellence in Limerick. Last week, a HSE report outlined serious problems in Limerick hospital relating to patient flow, inpatients, dignity and privacy for patients and staffing levels, yet the two hospitals in counties Clare and Tipperary were downgraded and services put in there. I heard the Minister quoted on the radio yesterday, although I am not sure whether it was accurate, as saying there was a fear due to the current climate that operations will be postponed due to Covid, but that is already happening in University Hospital Kerry. For the past seven weeks, elective surgeries have been suffering because of a lack of staff and early closing hours, and the number of day procedures has reduced. Moreover, trolley numbers have increased by ten times on the figure in 2012, and by 40% year-on-year to last December. Over the weekend, I spoke to a former neighbour of mine in Rock Street, Tralee, who has ulcerated feet. He is suffering because he cannot see a podiatrist, given there is no podiatrist in all of Kerry. He has to travel to Cork twice a month to see someone there, spending €100. On occasion, he has been on the way at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. and has got a text message to tell him he will have to return. He relies on the community services and his GP. Part of his toe fell off on Thursday night and he spent 12 hours waiting for an ambulance before he was seen, after which he was sent back to the same services as before. There is a fear in Kerry that services will be downgraded. I urge my colleagues up the country to ensure that will not happen in Navan.	spk_216

I want to raise a particular issue in regard to ceiling hoists being excluded from the housing adaptation grant. This was a decision taken a number of years ago, which directed the local authorities to change their policy in order that ceiling track hoists are no longer funded by the housing adaptation grant. I am not sure what the thinking is within the Department. Is it because of insurance or for some other reason? I am not sure, although we have been asking for a number of years.The grant aid ceased two years ago. A decision was made not to provide grants for these devices that require trained operators. It was to be taken up by the HSE but there is still no decision. I have raised this through parliamentary questions. A process of negotiation is ongoing as far as I understand. The Minister of State with responsibility for heritage responded to a recent parliamentary question stating a solution will be reached as soon as possible. In April last year this was raised by the O'Mahony family from Killarney. Last July they were told a decision would be made. They were told the same thing in September and March. They were told a consultation process is happening. I do not care who sorts it out so long as someone grasps the nettle and deals with it. I do not care whether it is someone from the Department dealing with health, housing, local government or disability. Whoever it is should make the decision because it is very important for the O'Mahony family. Their daughter Alexis has cerebral palsy quadriplegia with a high risk of aspiration. She is completely dependent on her family. She requires constant repositioning for washing to prevent injury. She requires two people to lift her, 24-hour care, regular repositioning and movement for her hygiene care. Her parents care for her. When her father is not present due to travelling for work it is very difficult for her mother to do this job. There is a risk of serious injury to Alexis. She has been waiting for the whole of the past year for a decision to be made so that she can get a grant for housing. I ask the Minister to make an exception and change the rule and do something about this so that her life can be made a little bit easier.	spk_24

Qualified scientists who worked through Covid, dealt with the cyberattack and accepted extra work are paid 8% less than colleagues who did the same work and who sit by side with them in the lab. Some earn less than those they supervise and others' wages decrease if they qualify. Whatever about pay, many hospitals, like University Hospital Kerry, have introduced compulsory on-site on-call rosters. This in effect is mandatory overtime.Staff must work obligatory overtime of 12 to 36 hours extra per week. Many staff at the hospital in Crumlin work 24 hours of extra overtime. In Kerry, the Monday to Friday staff must work the daytime as well as the night which means, in effect, a 20-hour shift, and from 8 p.m. they are on their own covering two departments and they get no proper break. On Saturdays, Sundays and bank holidays in Kerry, there used to be a 24-hour shift but that changed last year to a 12-hour shift so staff are working on twice as many weekends. I spoke to one scientist who has worked for 30 years and never had a strike day. In fact, I understand that the last industrial action was 50 years ago. Medical scientists have waited decades for this pay inequality to be resolved because clearly their pay and working conditions are not fair or reasonable.

Will he endorse proper resources and legislation for GSOC so it can look into these historic cases?	spk_261

Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-05-17	dail	33	Garda Síochána (Compensation) Bill 2021 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_13	I thank the Minister for her contribution. There may be a number of queries or questions regarding what she said in relation to it. Have there been representations in respect of what she said about the timeframe of 30 days for An Garda Síochána to make an application on behalf of the applicant? It seems like a very tight space of time. The Minister mentioned the PIAB. We have seen over the past 15 years of its operation that the PIAB does not necessarily speed up claims. In fact, it can contribute to claims taking much longer. With regard to what the Bill says about applying to the District Court, I am not so sure that many members of the Garda will want to take cases into the local District Court but we will see how those cases proceed. Sinn Féin will be supporting the Bill through to Committee Stage. As I said, we have some concerns that we will seek to raise in the form of some amendments at a later stage. Overall, however, it seems to be a positive Bill. This is provided that the provisions prove to be effective. It is worth outlining some of what the Bill does in order to set this in the correct context. The primary innovation is in reforming the current system relating to compensation for death or injury suffered by gardaí in the course of their duties. Currently, an injured member of An Garda Síochána, or his or her dependents in the case of death, may petition the Minister for Justice in order that he or she can apply in turn to the High Court for compensation. This is an archaic practice and reflects the need for reform to the system and the police as a whole in the State.The arm's length operation of An Garda Síochána, which is still ultimately responsible to the Minister for Justice, is a delicate process. The Bill will do the right thing in simplifying this process. That the Commissioner will replace the Minister for Justice in adjudicating whether the injury is eligible is, in the round, the correct step to take. Perhaps after the reform of policing is complete - a number of pre-legislative scrutiny reports were before the Joint Committee on Justice earlier - this could be re-examined, given that it seems to be a good function for the proposed Garda board or the Policing Authority to examine. Either way, there is currently a long delay within the  If an applicant is found to be eligible, whereby his or her injury has been deemed to have occurred in a malicious incident, an application can be made to PIAB which will then assess quantum in line with the usual process. PIAB has seen much reform over the years, mostly at the behest of the insurance industry, and payouts have decreased, albeit not with any great reduction in insurance premiums. Over the past 30 or 40 years, whenever the industry has promised lower premiums in exchange for reforms, the reductions do not seem to have been delivered. The industry asked for juries to be removed from personal injury cases and that was done, and that two fewer senior counsel would be required in cases and that was done. In addition, it asked for the PIAB system to be introduced, which was done, and for extensive dual-pricing reforms to be implemented, but we have not yet seen any results in terms of a reduction in premiums. In any event, as was reported by  I am somewhat concerned the Bill will fit in with the wider trend of shifting the costs and risks away from insurance companies or whoever pays for them and their ability to generate profits through ordinary citizens more generally. Sworn members of An Garda Síochána have bills to pay and are suffering from the cost of living crisis, as are many others. The fact that they face on-the-job risks must also be borne in mind, and wider Government failings on insurance and personal injuries should not ensnare them. The Minister might comment on this in her response. To return to the Bill, the PIAB process will proceed in the usual manner, subject to one or two changes, and it will be only when a claimant or respondent is dissatisfied with the outcome that he or she will be given leave to apply to the court. While I understand that the aim here is to speed up claims, I wonder whether this will mean delays will continue while the process is lengthened. The respondent in subsequent proceedings will be the Commissioner, reflected in the change whereby the Commissioner will be responsible for HR affairs in the Garda, a change to be introduced by the policing, security and community safety Bill, the report on which was, as I said, before the justice committee earlier. Perhaps there is something of a conflict of interest in respect of the Commissioner having to assess eligibility for individuals who will later become plaintiffs in proceedings against him or her. The synergies and issues between the Bill and the changes brought about in the policing, security and community safety Bill, are something the Minister might address. The inclusion of trainees in the Bill is important. The training of gardaí is changing rapidly and more and more on-the-job training seems to be coming to the fore. This brings risks with it, however, and it is right and proper that if a trainee were seriously injured or killed, he or she should also be eligible for compensation, which I welcome. There remains something of a backlog in Garda numbers due to Covid, which compromised class sizes. Accordingly, getting in more trainees in order that numbers will keep pace with population growth will be important. At the same time, proper resources and policing plans need to be implemented, which will keep people safe as much as increase Garda numbers. That the Bill takes in a wider definition of eligibility, including if the member is off duty or is formerly a member and has been injured as a result of that, is also welcome. Finally, legal costs can, of course, increase the cost to claimants where they retain a lawyer from the beginning of the process. The Bill should reduce the need to retain lawyers for hearings, although it remains likely that even in engaging with the process, legal advice will be required, as should be the case. The system will need to retain the confidence of the Garda in order that it will not be totally redundant. Currently, the fact a judge may not rule in respect of an injury suffered in pursuit of a suspect or in a road traffic accident caused some anxiety for members of An Garda Síochána. If this new system will provide more certainty and justice along with it, it should be embraced. In that regard, the six-month timeline for claims to be lodged, as set out in the legislation, may have to be re-examined on Committee Stage along with a few other matters. In regular personal injury cases, of course, the period lasts two years. We will be supporting the Bill passing Second Stage.	spk_287
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-05-11	dail	33	Defamation Act 2009 Review: Statements	dbsect_16	"In the context of my background in and thoughts regarding defamation law, I remember working in an office in Dublin some 25 years ago. One Saturday afternoon, we received word that members of a family were concerned that a Sunday newspaper, when a story was being written about somebody else, was going to, as those family members said, defame a relation. The newspaper was going to state that another member of the family was a drug addict and that she had worked in prostitution. The family members said that was not true. The woman in question had passed away the year before. We were not a legal practice that specialised in libel, but we contacted the newspaper in question. As the lady concerned was dead, I believed the usual restraints and the care and caution that would usually have been taken were dismissed. The dead cannot be defamed and a deceased person cannot sue, and that was the attitude of the newspapers. Without some protections being in place therefore, powerful institutions, newspapers or online creators would abuse their positions. I welcome this review. I mention specifically the changes that would make it easier and less expensive to seek a court order directing online service providers to disclose anonymous posters of defamatory material. I say that because many people defamed online, be they contributors to Facebook or Twitter, are defamed by people they do not know. Putting pressure on the social media companies is important in this regard. There is much in the review I welcome. As the Minister said, the legislation must protect the right to freedom of expression, while also safeguarding the right of citizens to a good name and reputation. This is about striking the right balance between these two aspects, which is going to be important and also difficult. Enshrining the right of access to justice, as the Minister said, is a core principle and an important one. Since that time 25 years ago, some cases in this context have been heard by the European Court of Human Rights. There was the Putistin  Similarly, many people who have been slighted, abused, offended by false, misleading comments or blatant lies feel that the expense of taking on a media outlet has put them off doing so. We must introduce legislation which allows access to justice without, as the Minister said, unnecessarily hampering freedom of speech. We must also call out certain attitudes towards freedom of speech and defamation that exist. There is still the legacy of section 31, which meant that people in my party were not allowed to speak on behalf of a union. That attitude is still prevalent sometimes, especially among some older members of the media. It was a millstone around the neck of free speech. Sometimes the NUJ was not good at attacking that limitation on free speech. Undoubtedly, most publishers of content, be they newspapers or social media platforms, are powerful organisations with significant resources. They are able to fact check stories and, like the insurance company that settles a case against the wishes of a policyholder, if media outlets take a business decision not to publish a story they feel they can stand over, that is their prerogative. It should not, however, hinder the rights of ordinary citizens to take a case. I note the Minister's recommendation is to end the use of juries in defamation cases. We must, though, bear in mind that the same arguments about extra legal costs and delays were mentioned 35 years ago when juries were abolished in personal injury cases. The insurance companies lobby said that would lead to a reduction in the cost of car insurance, but we all know what happened since. I also welcome the proposals to support an increased use of alternative dispute resolution and prompt correction and apology where mistakes are made. It is already the case, however, where a case is taken for defamation or libel, that an apology given at an early stage will reduce the amount of compensation that can be given. There is a general view in respect of having to satisfy extra tests and conditions, and the Minister said that ""Given the importance of safeguarding access to justice, the report recommends against introducing any such general measures"". I agree with the Minister on this aspect and I welcome her decision in this regard.These issues are of course not confined solely to the law, and reforms to the law will not affect media diversity and media ownership, as well as the matter of social media platforms and their policies. The Future of Media Commission and the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill will be instructive in this regard and represent opportunities to address these matters. Press freedoms and media diversity should also be protected by these measures. The defamation review gets quite a number of things correct, as I have said. There are a number of recommended measures that will speed up the hearing of claims, including the power, as the Minister mentioned, to dismiss a claim if it has not been progressed in a two-year window. Another improvement is the introduction of the proactive case management system, because the courts can become clogged with claims and counterclaims, distracting the courts from some other business. The anti-SLAPP provision is also important, because the court should be in a position to dismiss claims that are vexatious and merely looking to silence a critic of someone involved in big business. It should work hand in hand with the recommendations around legal aid, although the review does not establish a clear view on that matter. However, that can be discussed at a later stage. Many claims against individual defendants are never intended to end up in court. People want a quick resolution. Some people do not want the money, so long as an apology can be received and the content is taken down. Many people who take cases ask for a donation to be made to charity. They are not in it for the money, but they want an assurance that a person will not do it again. That is fair and should apply from the people at the top of big business to an ordinary person. There should not be two tiers. Some journalists have called that some people should not be taking claims. However, I disagree with that completely. More detail about all of that needs to worked out, especially in relation to eligibility for legal aid. However, it represents positive steps. Mediation will also be an improvement, although there are some circumstances in which it will be inappropriate. Mediation, in effect, usually takes place, in any event, between the lawyers. On the move towards judge-only trials, as I said, it might be a negative move. A serious harm test may prove too high a barrier for many. The Government’s thinking on the serious harm test seems to have been shaped by some lobby groups that are concerned by issues such as people who are accused of shoplifting suing for defamation. However, this is an area to be looked at for people who are falsely accused in the shop, for example. They need to have some access to justice. Many of those types of cases came back to security guards who did not receive adequate training and falsely accused some people. I have seen many such cases over the years. We need to be careful about civil law being hollowed out to suit the interests of business and its lobby groups. The resources of trade unions or consumer groups and of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, which does good work, to engage in those areas are stretched across a number of areas. Many of these groups can lead the State up a certain direction, as we have seen in the area of insurance reform. The Government needs to reflect on striking the balance between free speech and the right to a good name. I note what the Minister said about her justice plan for 2022 and a general scheme of defamation in quarter 4 of this year. I look forward to seeing that and working with her on it. I also look forward to seeing what the Office of the Attorney General returns with. I would like to finish on a press freedom matter. When we speak about press freedom around the world, I wish to condemn in the strongest terms the shooting dead of Shireen Abu Akleh and the injury to her colleague, who is in a stable condition. Shireen Abu Akleh was shot while reporting for Al Jazeera on an Israeli Defence Force raid on Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank, as I am sure the Minister is aware. According to some media outlets, there was no gunfire exchange and she was shot by Israeli snipers while wearing her press vest. Will the Minister and her Government work through the institutions to ensure this behaviour ceases and moves are made towards peace and justice in the Middle East? Will she support our call for a public investigation or public inquiry through the International Criminal Court, ICC?"	spk_200
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-05-11	dail	33	Protocol No. 21 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union: Motions	dbsect_17	I am happy to take part in this debate. It is important to deal with these issues. It is important the reserved powers under the treaty continue to be exercised by national parliaments. I know there have been some concerns about some issues relating to Europol and Eurodac. These must continue to be explored. Recently we had a number of debates on the Prüm decisions. Throughout we have pointed out that the UK was one of the largest users of these databases. As a consequence of the disastrous Tory Brexit, it has been cut off from usage of the database. As with so many other areas, it has put the UK in the position of speaking out of both sides of its mouth. It talks tough on crime but has tied its own hands in trying to get the resources to do so. Where agreement is possible, however, we should enable it but not at any cost. The British Government's efforts have not worked and the same is true with regard to the institutions in the North. We are happy for these proposals to proceed. With regard to the Kyoto Declaration I note it is to deal with the pillars of crime prevention, criminal justice, the rule of law and international co-operation. We do not oppose these. We agree that Ireland as an EU member state and a member of the UN should stand by the collective commitments contained in the declaration. Ireland has a long tradition of co-operating with European and international colleagues, as the Minister said in her opening statement, to reduce the impact of crime. With regard to the insolvency regulations we will be supporting the proposals.	spk_215
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-05-10	dail	33	Employment Equality (Pay Transparency) Bill 2022: First Stage	dbsect_8	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Employment Equality Act 1998 to provide for pay transparency in the advertising of jobs.I thank the Ceann Comhairle for granting me time and leave to introduce this Bill. I also thank the staff in the Bills Office and the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for their assistance in bringing this forward. I will share time with my colleague Deputy Conway-Walsh, who is co-signing the Bill. What this Bill does is straightforward. It will amend section 10 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 which deals with advertising in order that it will then read that a person shall not publish an advert relating to employment which omits the appropriate remuneration for a contract of employment. It will then forbid the ads from omitting the appropriate remuneration for the role. It is complementary to pay transparency and pay reporting, regarding which the Government has already introduced legislation. However, this is a more immediate and simple measure and is very much in keeping with the overall aim of equality and employment legislation. Similar legislation has been introduced in other jurisdictions such as Canada, Sweden and Norway. According to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, CIPD, with regard to the gender pay gap in Ireland, the differential between the average pay of males and females within an organisation is estimated at an average of 14% for 2021. Strong workers' rights legislation, education and childcare are all essential in addressing inequalities, but I hope this will be some small measure also. It will also prevent jobseekers going to the trouble of applying for employment only to discover a different rate of pay than they initially anticipated. Pay transparency is important as it allows women and minorities, in particular, to check if they are undertaking similar work for the same rates of pay. I heard Deputy Griffin mentioning a great Kerryman. Pay transparency and equality was achieved by another great man, Mike Quill from Kilgarvan, for his members on the buses and subways of New York in the 1950s and 1960s. The Bill will empower workers to negotiate better pay as they can benchmark themselves against the going rate. Lack of clarity on pay enables discrimination as women and men are prevented from making a case to be paid the same as colleagues where there is no transparent benchmarking. The Debenhams workers in Tralee, of course, were women in the main, and sectors such as retail, with a high concentration of women and minorities, see more and more violations of workers' rights. We must put a stop to this. I hope the Bill goes some small way towards doing so.	spk_173

Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-05-10	dail	33	Affordable Housing: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_15	I see around the county of Kerry from Tousist to Tarbert to Tureencahill and over to Ceann Trá the results, the problems and the fallout of current and previous Government policy over the past ten years. I see queues of 30 to 40 people seeking to rent a home. It is practically impossible to rent. Homelessness is on the increase. Vacant homes are not being turned around fast enough. Compulsory purchase orders to get housing back into use are practically non-existent. People are waiting on the housing list for 15 years. The decision to outsource social housing to the market ten years ago in tandem, I believe, with the abolition of the town councils of Tralee, Listowel and Killarney, was a disaster. I also see the lack of sewage treatment plants and wastewater treatment. In places like Glenbeigh, Castlegregory, Abbeydorney and Fenit, people cannot build two houses together because of the lack of any water system. At the other end, people cannot afford to purchase houses. It is hardly surprising when figures from the CSO tell us that house prices in the south-west region rose 15.4%. In 2020, house prices in Kerry increased more than in any other county. The  Government responses are overly reliant on a subsidy to developers, increasing inflation even before the current inflation crisis. The shared equity scheme should be abandoned. I know people who went into the previous one and, after 20 years, they still only own half their home. A builder recently presented me with a folder of price increases from builders' providers with near monthly increases across the board from providers. In housing, with both finance and purchase increasingly provided by private capital looking for a return, price increases are built into Government policy. Ordinary people are struggling, especially those who availed of the personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs, and who sold their homes in negative equity. They cannot avail of the fresh start scheme, which is only open to those who have availed of statutory insolvency schemes. Workers and families need proper solutions and I encourage everyone to support the motion.	spk_284
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-05-04	dail	33	EU Regulation: Motion	dbsect_20	"This proposal to amend regulation 2018/1727 in regard to collection, preservation and analysis of evidence relating to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes will be supported by us. The EU agency for criminal justice co-operation, Eurojust, co-ordinates the investigations and prosecutions of serious cross-border crime in Europe and beyond. Among other things, it investigates genocide and war crimes. We know that the prosecutor of the international Criminal Court has announced an investigation into possible war crimes committed by Putin's regime. The national authorities are collecting evidence of these crimes that have been committed in Ukraine. However, evidence cannot be stored securely in Ukraine. Therefore, a backup service or storage space must be secured. This must be set up, and this proposal envisages the establishment of the automated data management and storage facility. It is important that complies with the highest standards of data protection and cybersecurity. It goes without saying that the details of the Russian invasion of Ukraine have been shocking and deeply worrying. Putin's regime’s contempt for international law is clear in the existence of the invasion itself, but in addition to illegal occupation and annexation efforts it has conducted in the past, there is mounting evidence it is committing war crimes as well. A few sources have corroborated these suspicions. Human Rights Watch interviewed a number of civilians from occupied areas. It found evidence of summary executions and it is worth quoting it directly. It stated:These include a case of repeated rape; two cases of summary execution, one of six men, the other of one man; and other cases of unlawful violence and threats against civilians between February 27 and March 14 [of this year]. Soldiers were also implicated in looting ... including food, clothing, and firewood. [They] are responsible for war crimes.The UN also expressed concern. Secretary-General António Guterres visited a number of sites in Ukraine, calling it an ""obscenity"". The offices of the UN must be utilised as much as possible for ending the conflict and the Secretary-General’s call for the Russian Federation to co-operate should be heeded. I note what the Minister of State said on being proud of Ireland's response to the EU-wide response to the humanitarian crisis. I, too, am proud of the Irish response and the pace at which Ireland has mobilised in response. However, we must put a similar effort in to support the institutions in order to seek, negotiate and secure a peaceful solution. Over the past number of weeks I note that has not been to the fore as much as it should be. The International Criminal Court is the correct body, of course, to pursue the investigations and its investigators on the ground are facing numerous challenges. Accordingly, this motion should be supported because the difficult and dangerous task of documenting should be supported by the international community. Where European co-operation upholds international law and natural justice, of course, it should be supported. Now is not the time to go into such matters in great detail, but the scandal within Frontex, the EU border agency, where illegal pushbacks of refugees were found to have occurred, stands in contrast to the intention of this motion. International law should be upheld in all its aspects and it is only as good as those charged with enforcing it, which are frequently the rich and the powerful states. Ireland is undoubtedly part of the wider western nations and we should reflect long and hard before sacrificing our military neutrality. A militarised Ireland will not retain credibility when seeking to enforce international law, and as imperfect as the international institutions are, they represent a path towards peace and the upholding of human rights. As I said, neutrality is not about isolationism but, rather, it is about active engagement in the global community and pursuit of global justice through peaceful means. I welcome the recent poll where 75% of people support maintaining our neutrality. I met a man recently in west Cork who said that he would be first protesting if there was any change to that. Our neutrality needs to be defended, and all Deputies should state clearly where they stand on that issue - that they will fight to preserve and strengthen neutrality. We do not want to pay the extra billions per year that it would cost if we abandon that and join military alliances. Our status as a neutral state with no colonial baggage and independent foreign policy has stood us well and allowed us to play a valuable and honourable role in peacekeeping around the world."	spk_268

In keeping with the controversies mentioned by other speakers, my primary concern is that we get the best and most capable judges possible through any process. Political patronage does not necessarily promote those who are incapable of doing the job, but it certainly does exclude from consideration those who are as capable if not more so. I do not know if it still exists, but there was a culture in the law of some individuals joining political parties with the intent of keeping an option open as to whether they might get an appointment to the Bench. I remember being at a Law Society dinner once, where a late colleague came to the table and asked whether the six of us were ready for the Fianna Fáil church gate collection on Sunday morning. To my surprise, I discovered when I checked that I was the only one who was not a card-carrying member.	spk_269
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-04-27	dail	33	Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_18	Yes. In any event, it is not right and proper. There must be some transparency. Accountability is important and independence must be safeguarded. I must add that some of the people at that table, by the way, would have made fine judges. I might be relying on them for a vote at another time. Turning to the process of how people come to be judges and how they are promoted and elevated when they are on the Bench, it is important that some of the lay members of the commission have experience in consumer protection, perhaps trade union activity and-or the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC. The judges being appointed should, as was mentioned by Deputy Costello, have some experience in the courts. If not, they should be trained up. It is also not really appropriate for the Attorney General to be involved in the process. As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, I look forward to fuller engagement with the Minister regarding this legislation at a later stage. I welcome section 39. It is important to have equal numbers of men and women. Much work has been done on this aspect. It is also important to have a Judiciary reflective of the diversity of the people in the country. Equally, it is important that Irish speakers can access the courts through their native language. On a broader issue, I raise the issue of judicial processes on the island. I met Paula Rainey recently. She is the daughter of a Royal Ulster Constabulary, RUC, man who was killed in 1977. Her father was Joe Campbell, who was shot dead as he closed Cushendall station in County Antrim. His family believe he had uncovered collusion by members of the police with paramilitaries. Information was withheld from him regarding a specific threat. The RUC was, at least, negligent and failed to act to prevent one of its own being killed. Mr. Campbell was not even warned. In a subsequent investigation, the Chief Constable could not remember the incident. The investigation was inadequate. The Ombudsman's office investigated it and said it was damaging to the family and to policing. His widow is now 87 years old. The members of the family have waited since 1977 for truth and justice. I ask the Government not to consent to the amnesty legislation and to ensure the inquest is not delayed any more. It is also necessary to ensure the terms of reference for the inquest state the British State will be compelled to undertake a transparent process and not be able to hide behind any false national security claims.	spk_271
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-04-27	dail	33	No. 2 - Mineral Oils Tax: Financial Resolution	dbsect_34	Over the past fortnight, on the one hand we have seen Ministers trying to muddy the water to avoid the obvious conclusion that Government policy in the shape of the carbon tax will not work and will further penalise those who are struggling most with the cost of living crisis. At the same time, backbenchers who cannot stand the heat are leaking reports of conversations in order to cover themselves locally. As with everything else, this Government has been reactive rather than proactive. We have the highest rate of inflation in years but the Government's answer has been to increase tax. The first attempt at a solution was to reduce the VAT rate to 9%. We asked for this last year and the Government criticised us for it before changing its mind. The Government is firefighting instead of implementing a just transition. We asked the Government to cut the duty on fuel and the Government also changed its mind in that respect. We asked for a reduction in duty or excise on home heating oil but we are waiting for the Government's reaction. Not only is this Government out of touch, it is more interested in criticising the Opposition than operating a just transition. Others have been calling for a commitment on a permanent basis to the large-scale commercial sale of turf when they know it is not an idea grounded in reality. People need to get real. Many people rely on turf in my constituency and it has not been subject to price hikes. Many who rely on this fuel are those who struggle most with the cost of living crisis and they will need to choose between freezing or going hungry, driving to college or eating. These are areas with no public transport. Government policy for years has been to inflict extra costs on workers and families, including bin charges and property taxes. It has sought to outsource services and reduce public services at the same time. We have seen reports that a large corporation in Limerick is allowed to burn tyres as a fuel yet nothing is being done to move costs to those who can afford it. That company is burning tyres but small households will not be able to burn turf. How is that fair? We need a just transition and this is not it. There is a better way, especially through retrofitting and ensuring policy is informed by an understanding of energy poverty. Grants must be directed towards retrofitting and away from processes that enable the rich to buy electric cars. The neoliberal approach must be rejected and Government Deputies must reflect on shifting the burden to those most able to pay.	spk_493
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-04-26	dail	33	Prüm II Proposal: Motion	dbsect_15	We have discussed automated data exchange under the Prüm framework on several occasions in addition to cross-border databases related to crime. As we outlined before, Sinn Féin welcomes this co-operation as long as the databases are operated with the correct level of oversight. Cross-border co-operation is a non-negotiable element of modern law enforcement, especially against organised crime. In 2017, it was estimated that there are 5,000 serious and organised crime gangs, 70% of which are active in more than three countries. Anti-money laundering regulations and civil forfeiture through the likes of the Criminal Assets Bureau have meant these gangs have become increasingly sophisticated, and some of them work in co-operation rather than in competition with each other. This poses great challenges in confronting them. I commend the efforts of An Garda Síochána in tackling large criminal organisations here in combination with other law enforcement agencies, including those in the US, Spain and the UK. There can be no hiding place for the criminal organisations. Irish organisations are alleged to have collaborated with gangs in Italy, the Balkans and the Netherlands, and they are also active in the UK, Spain and the United Arab Emirates. Clearly, more collaboration between law enforcement agencies is necessary. While we hope these gangs can be taken on, I sound a note of caution. With the disruption to criminal networks, we can expect to see increased competition for supply lines and market share. This could lead to feuding and violence, which will see ordinary communities suffering the consequences. We need to address the underlying demand for drugs, ensure proper healthcare and tackle supply. The link between the casual use of cocaine in this country and organised crime must be highlighted. The proliferation of cocaine use in the smallest towns and villages is directly leading to the enrichment and empowerment of the organisations. With regard to the set of measures currently under consideration, there are several points to be made. First, the facial image proposals promise much in terms of effectiveness in catching criminals, but there are civil liberties concerns. Data being available only on a hit, no hit basis, with no provision for generalised access, is welcome. It is important to streamline the exchange of personal and case-related data and ensure the automatic exchange of data for criminal investigations, with a high level of data protection. However, envisaging no artificial intelligence does not go far enough, perhaps. We should be wary of the use of automated processes using large data sets. There is a balance to be struck where serious crime is concerned. Databases should be airtight in terms of legal challenges on human rights grounds so criminals will not be in a position to overturn their convictions on technicalities and so we may protect the rights of ordinary people. Any risks of false positives should be eliminated. Second, the central router for data needs to be properly supervised. I am curious as to whether there is a physical storage location. With the use of PULSE, we have seen that systems can sometimes be open to abuse and that access to criminal records from other countries carries a risk. This is all the more reason to have the necessary safeguards in place. Let me sound one more note of caution related to the processes and potential abuses by EU member states. Spain, for example, was found to be using the Pegasus spyware against peaceful Catalan independence activists. International law and treaties create binding obligations in these areas. It is right and proper to proceed with caution. The motion and the measures proposed do so.	spk_328
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-04-05	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_36	I am glad of the opportunity to raise this at such short notice. Recently, I met a family from Killarney, Steve O'Mahony, his wife, Teresa, and their daughter, Alexis. I want to raise an issue on their behalf. We discussed a cut that has been made to disability funding. This cut was not made by the HSE or the Department of Health. It is the removal of funding for ceiling track hoists from housing adaptation grants. Alexis is six years old next week. She has cerebral palsy, quadriplegia, subluxation of her right hip and a high risk of aspiration, that is food or drink going in to her lungs. Alexis is completely dependent for her daily care. She requires constant repositioning for washing and to prevent injury, and she needs two people to hoist her. The Minister of State will be aware of housing adaptation grants. Kerry County Council has a budget of €3 million to spend on housing adaptation grants, which help our elderly and disabled family members, making life easier for them living in the community. Grants are available to make repairs or improvements to their homes. According to a letter received last month by Mr. Steve O'Mahony, in September 2020 the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government informed local authorities that ceiling hoists should not be included in the housing adaptation grant. Since then, most local authorities no longer provide funding for the provision of the hoist itself although they may fund the structural works, that is, to place hoist tracks in the ceilings. Mr. O'Mahony had raised this issue in July last year and he was told by the Department that departmental officials were engaging with the HSE. That was in July. Again, in September, following a question, he learned that officials were still engaging with the HSE. While these discussions take place, however, those with disabilities, their carers and their families are suffering. Steve, Teresa and Alexis have a quotation for €5,000 for the provision and supply of a ceiling track hoist. According to Alexis's occupational therapist, OT, a hoist will improve the efficiency of lifting, improve Alexis's quality of care, require fewer caregivers, decrease her care needs and reduce physical discomfort and injury to her five-year-old body parts. It facilitates more time to her parents to provide care for their child. Alexis has other equipment needs that occupy a lot of floor space and, as she grows, it is highly recommended, again by the occupational therapist, that a ceiling hoist will ensure comfortable mobility and a dignified experience for Alexis and her carers. It will give this family a break. This is essential for this family. Families like the O'Mahonys are already struggling with the physical, mental and financial costs of care. There is, according to the OT, a risk of a high incidence of musculoskeletal injuries among caregivers. Teresa, Alexis's mother, already has back injuries as a result. Decisions like these, or the lack of a decision in this case, exacerbates and compounds their struggles. I am asking the Minister of State to make a decision that basic fairness to this family and fairness to people with disabilities demands. Their home is ready to go. Will the Minister of State reverse the decision, please, and allow funding for these essential works from housing grants?	spk_414
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-04-05	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_36	I thank the Minister of State. What is going on here is unbelievably bureaucratic in that the reinforced ceiling costs can be provided for but something that requires the assistance of a carer cannot. In this case, a carer inevitably means Mr. and Mrs. O’Mahony. They are caring for their daughter who has a severe disability - cerebral palsy and quadriplegia - but are excluded from the scheme. The Minister of State’s answer would be great except it is the same answer the Department gave in July and September of last year and again last month. While these negotiations are taking place, the family of this child, who I met at the St. Patrick’s Day parade, continue to suffer. Steve O’Mahony said that families like his do not want these hoists for their children out of choice but because they are a basic necessity. Every day that this drags on, he said, is another day of physical stress caused by constantly moving the person with the disability, washing them and so on. Will the Minister speak to his officials to see if the scheme can be expanded? I would not ask him to do so if it were not essential for young Alexis to be helped and her family to be given a break.	spk_416

Ag an bpointe seo anuraidh bhíomar ag feithimh le fógra ó Uisce Éireann mar gheall ar infheistíocht i bhfuíolluisce i gCiarraí. We have a serious problem in County Kerry with wastewater treatment systems. This time last year we were waiting for an announcement from Irish Water that at the end of quarter 1 we would have good news in regard to a list of villages around the county where investment would be made available for the enhancement or replacement of wastewater treatment systems and plants around the county. In June we eventually received notification that the Kilcummin sewerage system and the Kenmare wastewater treatment plant upgrade would be included in the Irish Water capital investment plan as capital projects. The only others to be mentioned were Fenit, or An Fhianait, and Knightstown, or An Chois, on Valentia Island. It seemed that those wastewater treatment plants were to be included in another scheme, the small towns and villages growth programme, but the latest I have heard is that no further upgrades are anticipated under the current programme for any other small towns or villages around the county. In Abbeydorney, there is a huge issue with development. Everybody knows how difficult it is to find GPs who will open surgeries in small villages. A proposed new GP surgery, which is so badly needed and is currently operating out of a couple of rooms in a community centre, is stalled because there is no wastewater treatment system in place in Abbeydorney, despite three or four estates having been built over the past 20 years. In Fenit money was promised in June of last year. It is currently not possible to build more than two houses in Fenit. A possible hotel is also proposed in anticipation of the Tralee to Fenit greenway, which is supposed to open this summer. There is an anticipated influx of tourists and day-trippers who will go to Fenit and allow Fenit to achieve its potential. However, without news of any movement on the wastewater treatment plant, that is not possible. All around the rest of the county, in Glenbeigh, Rathmore and Duagh, the lack of investment flies in the face of plans to prioritise towns and villages and to invest in communities and long-established settlements. It is deeply frustrating when we contact planners about a proposed development, whether it is residential or commercial, and time and again we are told that we have to get a report from Irish Water and that people who are applying for planning permission must obtain that report before the investment or development can take place. In Castlegregory, which is right beside the sea, the system is no more than a holding tank, which is a large septic tank about 100 yd from the sea. It is completely unacceptable from an environmental, residential, and developmental point of view. In the past, when Kerry County Council had control and responsibility for water, it carried out works on treatment plants in Castleisland, Dingle, Listowel, Cahersiveen, Ballybunion, Milltown and Tralee. Irish Water has been working on the water system and even though I was not a fan of the establishment of Irish Water and I was against it at the time, to give credit where it is due, it has done some good work on the water system, but it is not doing enough on wastewater. It was a mistake to take that responsibility away from Kerry County Council. It is hard to think of a single case, be it refuse, housing, health, or orthopaedic surgeries, where a better service or a cheaper and better value service was provided when it was outsourced. We had a list last year and we still have a totally inadequate wastewater system. We had the Fenit announcement but we are waiting. We had Kilcummin on a smaller scale but we are still waiting on that. Will the Minister of State enlighten me as to what is happening with this?	spk_14
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-03-30	dail	33	Wastewater Treatment	dbsect_3	I thank Minister of State for his reply. I took some notes on what the Minister of State said and while the amount of investment is welcome, it does not seem to be translating into any proposed developments for the towns and villages I mentioned. Is Castlegregory going to have to wait? When the Fenit project was announced last year, it said it was a five-year programme. Is that programme still going ahead? Does the Minister of State have any information about that? If he does not have the information here perhaps he will get it to me. Is that programme still on track for Fenit? The Minister of State mentioned €100 million for 37 projects in 27 local authority areas. With the small towns and villages programme, it seems there are only two proposed for Kerry. I do not believe this is enough in a county that suffers from peripherality. The programme for Government is supposed to enhance the smaller towns and villages to bring people in, to move away from one-off rural development and bring people into villages. There seems to be a complete contradiction between what is in the programme for Government and what is being delivered on the ground. Nothing has been delivered on the ground for the people in Glenbeigh, Abbeydorney, Duagh and Rathmore. There seems to be a lot of money invested but if I had my way it would be given back to Kerry County Council which could co-ordinate the whole project. Water services in the county were moved to a specific place in Castleisland. Expertise was built up over many years and was in one place, but now there is too much pulling and dragging. There does not seem to be a co-ordinated approach. It is deeply frustrating for the people who are in those villages, for those who cannot develop and for those who cannot move back from the cities given the opportunities now for remote working. That is being hindered by the lack of investment in those places.	spk_19

Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-03-22	dail	33	Rising Energy Costs: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_9	Yesterday, I was in my local butcher's shop where the conversation was not about Kerry's win over Armagh or where the Ministers were on holidays, but about the struggle that the people who were buying their meat at the counter were dealing with every day. I spoke to the owner of the shop today. A drum of oil is up 23%, the price of chicken has doubled, the price of lamb is up 50% and the prices of breading, packaging and butter are up 30%. We are not here to speak about prices in the butcher's shop, but one of the main factors in all of this is the increase in energy prices. Kerry is a county that has been heavily affected by the rise in fuel costs, which will undoubtedly continue to increase. There does not seem to be any end in sight. Obviously, the invasion of Ukraine has not helped, but inflation across the board has been a long time coming as a result of policies dating back over a decade and fully endorsed and pursued by members of this Government. In 2013, we in Sinn Féin called on the then Government not to sell Bord Gáis to Centrica for the knock-down price of €129 million. In the past three years, Centrica's profits from Bord Gáis have been €50 million, €33.5 million and €55 million, so that was not a bad price at which to get Bord Gáis. My county has a great degree of peripherality, a poor public transport network and many isolated and rural areas. We are even more affected by the increase in energy prices as a result of the Government's policies. During Leaders' Questions today, the Government stated that it could not control what was happening on the world stage. It cannot, but it can react to it. I call on the Minister of State to take steps to react to it and make the burden easier for the people who are standing at the butcher's counter and who were going to buy three breasts of chicken but left the shop with only one because they could not afford the second and third. This is the type of crisis we are hearing about. I could list all of the various increases - Bord Gáis, coal and so on - but this is what we have come down to, namely, people eating less than they normally would and being unable to budget up to the end of the week.This is what they are stuck with as a result of this Government not reacting and of the policies of Governments over the past decade. The motion calls for a cost of living cash payment, a reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel, a derogation to reduce VAT, the extension of the fuel allowance - I understand people on community employment schemes who are trying to get work cannot get it in a lump sum to pay their fuel costs so I want the Minister to try to deal with that as well, and a discretionary fund of €15 million to assist those households.	spk_147
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-03-09	dail	33	Council Decision on Hate Speech and Hate Crime: Motion	dbsect_21	This debate comes not too long after the Joint Committee on Justice's pre-legislative scrutiny of the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill 2021. At the time, the committee heard that the Bill is an attempt to consolidate all legislation related to crimes motivated by hate. I have listened to what the Minister has said as to how this might affect the Bill and what interaction between domestic and EU law will look like afterwards. Minimum standards regarding crime with cross-border implications makes sense as we are in an increasingly connected world and, as she said, an increasingly diverse society. In addition to Ireland being seen as a tax haven and carbon emissions haven for corporations, there is a risk that we might be perceived as being weak on hate speech on social media. I welcome what the Minister said with regard to the online safety commissioner. I look forward to seeing the minimum standards set out in the motion, which should combat such speech. At the same time, we must be conscious of the context of speech. This must be advanced in tandem with equality and free speech. Sometimes, people who are fighting for material fairness, for example, with regard to the Palestinian cause, must be taken into account. I reject any notion that standing with oppressed peoples must constitute hate against others. We must be careful not to end up in a worse place as a society by introducing laws in a vacuum.  During the committee's meeting, I raised a number of surveys and statistics. I welcome what the Minister said about her conversation with An Garda Síochána with regard to internal recording. We need more comprehensive data, particularly with regard to sexual violence and other categories of crime. In dealing with the Traveller community, confidence in the justice system is vitally important. We must remember the experiences of the Irish community in England and what they had to deal with. Irish people did not have confidence in the justice system there. Our minority communities and Travellers are in a similar situation and they must have confidence in the justice system here. With regard to data, while I do not advocate following the UK's approach, it is streets ahead of us in respect of data and statistics and we should seek to match it. I look forward to a more in-depth examination of the upcoming Bill and the implications of this motion when the Bill goes to First Stage proper.	spk_343

One of the people they were dealing with, a speech and language therapist, told them that the recommended caseload was 25, while the actual caseload to be dealt with was 400. There must be workforce planning in this regard because the stress this situation has placed on parents of children has led to marriages breaking up and to making a difficult situation even worse. A structure must be put in place to make this system as effective as possible for the children. Early intervention can make the difference between a full life and a significantly diminished one. We have spoken before about the issues that affect children with special educational needs and this situation is getting more grotesque. The courts are getting more crowded with cases that have been taken by desperate parents. Mr. Justice Meenan recently questioned whether such cases were the best use of the resources of the justice system, given how many are settled, which is practically all of them, and costs awarded. While constrained by the separation of powers, the judge has a point. Cases may be settled, but the proverbial situation is one where no cases would have needed to have been taken at all if there had been proper provision of services instead.  That would avoid situations like the one we saw recently in Kerry. As part of the scandal there concerning the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, children who needed special educational supports were left waiting. They were sometimes prescribed antipsychotic medication when they were suffering from social anxiety and issues like that. That harmed those children and compounded the developmental issues they were experiencing. Permanent damage was sometimes caused to them, cutting off what could have been a fruitful developmental arc if they had received the proper supports. In cutting corners and pinching pennies, the Government has created hostages to fortune. It is, however, the lives of these children we are dealing with. Urgent action in line with the steps outlined in our motion is required.	spk_267

Anuraidh, bhí an t-ádh linn i gCoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus Phobal Labhartha na Gaeilge cloisteáil ó choimisinéir teanga na Breataine Bige ag an am, Aled Roberts. Fuair sé bás tamall gairid ina dhiaidh sin tar éis a bheith breoite ar feadh ama gairide. Ba mhaith liom m'ómós a thabhairt dá chuid oibre agus déanaim comhbhrón lena chlann, lena ghaolta agus lena chairde uile. Chualamar Aled Roberts, a phaisean agus an saineolas a bhí aige agus a bhí soiléir nuair a bhí sé ag caint linn. D'ardaíomar na comharthaí bóithre leis nuair a bhí sé linn sa choiste. Labhair mé faoin ábhar seo cheana féin. Bheadh sé sách simplí an méid a leanas a dhéanamh: ba chóir go mbeadh na comharthaí bóithre Gaeilge curtha sa phríomháit, seachas in áit na leathphingine. I gContae an Chláir, mar shampla, feicimid ""Coillte"" agus as Béarla feicimid ""Quilty"". I gContae na Mí, seachas ""An Obair"" sa phríomháit feicimid ""Nobber"". Ba chóir go mbeadh an phríomháit don logainm Gaeilge agus go mbeadh an Béarla sa dara áit. Déantar é sin sa Bhreatain Bheag mar chuid de reachtaíocht tánaisteach. Is féidir agus is ceart é sin a dhéanamh in Éirinn chomh maith agus ba chóir don Rialtas féachaint air seo a thabhairt isteach, b'fhéidir mar ionstraim reachtúil nó statutory instrument. Dúirt an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, roimhe seo go raibh scéim phíolótach ann a d'achtaigh an polasaí seo, a pilot scheme as opposed to a Pontius Pilate scheme as you cannot wash your hands of this. An bhfuil sé sin fíor mar dúirt an tAire Stáit ina dhiaidh sin gur ceist don Roinn Iompair é? Ní dóigh liom gur ceist don Roinn Iompair atá ann. Mar Aire Stáit le freagracht as an nGaeilge agus as pobal na Gaeilge, is cinnte go bhfuil sé seo go daingean fós ina chúram féin. Is féidir leis agus is ceart dó é sin a chur i gcrích. Scríobh mé go dtí an tAire Stáit faoi dhó ag cur in iúl conas a d'fhéadfadh sé sin a dhéanamh. Fiú amháin mholamar foclaíocht dó. B'fhéidir go mb'fhearr cruinniú a bheith againn chun díospóireacht a dhéanamh air sin. Ceist ríthábhachtach eile mar gheall ar neart agus cosaint na Gaeilge is ea an cumas atá ag daoine teacht ar sheirbhísí poiblí trí Ghaeilge. Tá An Garda Síochána ar ceann de na príomhchomhlachtaí Stáit a bhíonn an caidreamh is mó ag daoine leis. Is iomaí uair a rinne an coiste iarracht freagraí a fháil mar gheall ar drochsholáthar seirbhísí i nGaeilge agus le déanaí tháinig finnéithe os comhair na coiste chun labhairt faoi deireadh a chur le ceanglas áirithe a bhaineann le labhairt na teanga. Bhí cruinniú agam le Todhchaí na Tuaithe mar is rud an-tábhachtach é, mar a dúirt cúpla Ball eile, daoine a bheith ag maireachtáil sa Ghaeltacht. Bhuaileas le duine darbh ainm Andrea Palandri as Venezia nó Venice san Iodáil. Tá sé ina chónaí i gCorca Dhuibhne agus tá Gaelainn den scoth aige. Dúirt sé liom go bhfeiceann sé na problems céanna a chonaic sé i Venice. Níl daoine in ann maireachtáil sa chathair in aon chor agus níl siad in ann fanacht ansin. Tá siad ag cailliúint na teanga agus an idiom a bhí acu i Venice chomh maith agus feiceann sé na fadhbanna sin anseo. B'fhéidir go mbeadh an tAire in ann rud a dhéanamh mar gheall air sin."	spk_344
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-03-01	dail	33	Health Waiting Lists: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_13	Deputy Conway Walsh is very obliging. Bhí rud suimiúil i rith na géarchéime a bhí i CAMHS i gCiarraí agus i rith na géarchéime eile san ospidéal i dTrá Lí maidir leis na leithscéalta a bhí ag an Rialtas mar gheall ar na deacrachtaí a bhí aige le hearcaíocht. One of the curious things about the recent crisis in the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in Kerry and the ongoing difficulties in University Hospital Kerry has been the excuses about the difficulties faced in terms of recruitment. Bed needs staff and consultant vacancies are widespread say the Government. Why would people not come down if there was a salary of €200,000 on offer? However, the new waiting list plan essentially amounts to repackaging much of the current difficulties, expenditure and measures. What are we to expect, if the investment and conditions do not improve? The CAMHS scandal, no more than the difficulties that other consultants face, is as a result of the inadequate resources and team and some consultants not even having an office. How does the Government expect to attract new consultants down to places such as Kerry when the necessary resources are not in place? Worse than that, however, is how the Government claims to be trying to address the issues in the public system, tying one hand behind its back. There may be obstacles to the implementation of Sláintecare, but investment in the public system is the only way to overcome it, such as through directly-employed staff. What about the salary GPs mentioned in Sláintecare? There should be 200 of them throughout the country. I have not seen any of them so far. Local government representatives, however, continue to advocate and back the private system over the public system. That does not help, either, and will only set up the health system to fail. The Minister asked about the ideas coming from here. Elective surgeries were postponed in Kerry for a period of six months. Most, but not all, of them have only recently come back. Hip and knee replacements are still outsourced to private hospitals. The Minister was looking for other ideas. The orthopaedic ward has not been done. The colposcopy unit still has not been made. The plans the five Kerry Deputies saw in a meeting last November 12 months are still on a desk in Dublin awaiting approval. I saw what the Minister has said about all the new full-time staff being added to the workforce but the difficulty is that experienced nurses are leaving. I ask all the Deputies, especially Kerry Deputies, to back this plan, keep the job guarantees to health graduates, reduce the inequality in pay and remove private practice from public hospitals.	spk_340
Pa Daly	42	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2022-02-24	dail	33	Town Centre First Policy: Statements	dbsect_31	I will rant away for a while so. I welcome the town centre first plan and the intentions are good. A lot of it sounds great such as the goal of commissioning research to inform the assessment of cost benefit and social return on investment in town centres to better inform public policy interventions. That sounds great if you could understand what it means. I will give two practical examples of why the town centre first initiative is not working and I will give the example of Tralee town centre. It is the only part of the county that between 2005 and 2011 had a population decline at the height of the Celtic tiger. One problem is that there is a 100% waiver of commercial rates for vacant commercial premises where the owner of the property says he or she is trying to sell the property. This should be the exception rather than the rule. If a premises is left empty for more than 12 months it should either be sold or leased or the owner should be punished by the imposition of full commercial rates. In the UK, where these problems have been seen in the past 20 to 30 years, they have come to the conclusion that it is not good enough just to have people living in the town centre; people must also be working there. Allowing a situation where people can continue to sit on properties has to be unacceptable and the Government needs to intervene to make it impossible for that type of situation to continue. The other example I will give is of the courthouse on Ashe Street in Tralee town centre. The courthouse has been there since the days of Daniel O’Connell and it was quarried from local limestone in the town park. It is literally part of the town and has been for many years. It saw many trials and is part of the history and social fabric of the town. There is a proposal, with the collaboration of Kerry County Council management, to move the Courts Service to another vacant premises in the town centre, a brown centre site as the Minister of State said. That is a retrograde step and goes against nearly every single one of the recommendations in the town centre first plan. This includes climate change because a new building will have to be built close to the town centre. There is no additional benefit to the town from the land which was given away to the town council at the time by Kerry Group. To advance this type of development in the town centre and to bring jobs into Tralee town centre it should be kept on Ashe Street, where it has been for 170 years. Many people will say it does not fit the needs of a modern court building or that the Courts Service has nothing to do with the Government, which is the last answer I got. I was told I would have to talk to the Courts Service about it, but the Minister of State is in government, so if he is serious about the town centre of the only large town in the whole of Cork, Limerick and Kerry, namely, Tralee, he will have to intervene to make sure there is an additional benefit to the town centre by keeping court services there. Architects were mentioned and architects have decided that a grade 2 or 3 heritage architectural review must take place before any courthouse is abandoned, but that has been ignored in this situation. There is a plan but it is a bad plan, and to have all the other things that are mentioned in the town centre first plan, such as helping with the social and cultural future of the town, getting people into the town centre, and having people living there, it is important the Denny site, which is free, would be used for that. We should enhance and refurbish the courthouse in Tralee and the Government needs to intervene in that. I want to mention something I have noticed over the past ten or 15 years. If a council is dealing with a local authority estate, it has an obligation to have proper estate management in place. Far too often I have seen that there is no estate management or proper balance when councils deal with town centres.If there are to be grants for refurbishing houses and getting people to live in the centre of towns, an emphasis should be put on people who will live there as owner-occupiers rather than just having an investment in a property to rent it out to anybody. I was looking up the census of Rock Street in Tralee town centre. Approximately 400 people were living on that street in their own places according to the census of 1911. Now, there are approximately 25. If we want people living in the town centre, that has to be pushed. We also have to get people working in there, and that means maintaining, keeping, enhancing and developing the structures already there, and if there is an extra space, such as there is in Tralee town, moving to that to encourage new centres where people can, as it says in the plan, enhance the cultural element of the town.	spk_281

There were children who asked to self-medicate and who were a year without follow-up appointments. Those with social anxiety and chronic fatigue dosed with antipsychotic medication. The acknowledgment of the report and the apology is a start. The 35 recommendations must be implemented without further delay. Parents need care plans immediately. They need the scope of the review to be broadened to north Kerry and beyond. Parents who need anonymity need to have that guaranteed in any redress scheme. The HSE must pay for an independent consultant or consultants to review the files and advise the parents on treatment and the harm done to their children. As noted, the WHO says that 12% of healthcare spending should be on mental health. Here it is less than 6%. Hence the waiting lists and short staffing. We need the right resources. We need key workers, social workers, proper oversight and the ending of pay disparities between the different systems and the improvement of working conditions, offices and support staff. The capacity deficiencies and geographic inequalities also need to be addressed. In my area, there is the longest waiting list in the State. It comprises 682 children, almost half of whom have been waiting to access CAMHS for more than a year. The motion is not a request; it is a demand. Our children deserve what it seeks.	spk_262

When they reached out in desperation due to her eating disorder, they found that Éist Linn, Linn Dara and Merlin Park were unavailable to them because there are not enough beds. The simplest answer is that there should be more beds but there should be more consultants. The report that came out today by Dr. Seán Maskey mentions the difficulties with finding consultants. It is not good enough to say this when the support structures, support staff and equipment are not in place for doctors. That is one of the reasons consultants cannot be found. This report contains devastating findings and exposes a lot that is wrong in our health service or lack of health service for some people. I spoke to another father today who told me that his daughter had social anxiety when she was transitioning into secondary school and went to see a doctor through CAMHS. Having read the report today and having received his apology, he feels sickened. It is soul-destroying, he said, to read the report. The family is devastated, angry and upset, not only because the structures were not in place but there was no care plan, no psychologist, no cognitive behavioural therapy, no oversight, no organisation, not even a shared diary. Referring to the south Kerry group as a team is a complete misnomer. Quite clearly the doctor who had got a reference from somebody, I do not know who, was working solo. Children who did not even have ADHD were put on risperidone, an antipsychotic medication. One child, I was told, did not even recognise her parents, did not establish reality and did not know whether she was dreaming or it was reality when her parents would come into her room. Another parent told me his child went from 9 stone to 18 stone from when he was 15 to 17. I remember meeting that child and wondering how he had put on so much weight. He was suffering from depression and his weight increased. The scandal here is why were so many children put on risperidone. Why was that being carried out across the board? We do not know how much was known. Still with some of the parents there has been no intervention and there is still no care plan. That should be worked on.	spk_398

Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-12-08	dail	33	Ceisteanna ar Reachtaíocht a Gealladh - Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_10	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the time to speak about the hospital in Dingle. In 2008, Ospidéal Pobal Chorca Dhuibhne was granted funding of €16.4 million and promised to deliver badly needed services for west Kerry, including 76 beds, an X-ray service and a place where minor injuries could be treated. The hospital, however, has not fared well under successive Governments and is operating now at 30 beds below capacity. It never provided more than 54 beds. Given the storm that happened recently and the extra pressure that is on the health service, there is a need for extra services on the peninsula. Eight residential beds and eight short-stay beds have been closed due to lack of staff. The fact that the hospital has never delivered on its full potential is, in my view, a disgrace. As a former Minister for Health, what is the Taoiseach going to do about the matter?	spk_214
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-12-01	dail	33	Criminal Justice (Smuggling of Persons) Bill 2021 [Seanad]: Committee Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_45	I concur with what the previous speaker said and support Deputy Connolly's amendment. I am thinking in particular of Seán Binder, who spent some time in County Kerry. He was arrested four months after arriving in Lesbos in 2018. He faces trial, as we know. Particularly in light of what happened in the English Channel, there is a feeling out there that there are hordes of people fleeing wars, most of whom are entitled to asylum, who are being lured in by people traffickers, criminals and so on. That is not the case. What has really happened over the past few years is that the UK in particular has stopped people applying for asylum. Their cases are stronger than ever. The west, let us face it, was complicit in creating the situations in Syria and in Iraq and for the Kurds which have led to all these people trying to get over here. The reason I support the amendment is that the Bill, as drafted, would allow for people providing humanitarian assistance to be charged with an offence while their defence is awaited. They could perhaps be held on remand while awaiting trial. That should not be the case. There is something wrong with that. We need to reach out to some of the people trying to get over from France and create a Syrian response to what has been happening to them because it cannot continue. It is particularly ironic that, coming up to Christmas, Middle Eastern families - women, including pregnant women, and children - are drowning in probably the busiest sea channel in the world. They are taking the risk. They are buying kayaks in sports shops in their desperation to try to get across. Anyone who is legitimately trying to help those people cannot be criminalised.	spk_529
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-11-30	dail	33	Employment Support Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_19	"I support the motion. The Government's stance is mind-boggling. The tendering process does not make sense and the community not-for-profit model must be preserved and not dismantled. I find it hard to understand why the Government would do something like this from a community point of view, a jobs point of view and a political point of view. Taking the decision to commercialise these schemes and introducing targets and quotas and commissions means that staff will have little incentive to ask what is actually best for a person coming through their doors and would seek to make a profit from them. It will cause a loss of jobs. Groups such as NEWKD, South Kerry Development Partnership and IRD Duhallow have gathered knowledge and skills over the past 25 years and have become experts in career guidance. They have guided our communities through the financial crash and subsequent Government austerity measures. Since 2008, more than 2,000 people have gone through the doors of the South Kerry Development Partnership. The organisation never said no to them. It kept its doors open when everyone else was turning people away and suggesting they go to Australia. It trained these people and brought them back into the jobs market. The Government says that there is nothing it can do, which translates as ""there is nothing it will do"". The Government says it has legal advice. The Minister has seen the legal advice that states the Government is not obliged to tender.These schemes, such as the rural social scheme, have been of great benefit to rural communities. They support the essence of community work, activities such as driving buses, taking the elderly to centres and maintaining sports grounds. Kerry social farming has also seen massive success. The six-year rule will send men in south Kerry away from fulfilling, life-enhancing work in their communities that gives them a sense of pride and return them to the dole, leaving them with nothing to do in these isolated areas and limited social interaction. Why pay them to stay at home? Why not keep them on the schemes? The Minister should admit now that this is a mistake. Who is going to do the community work in deeply rural areas when her 2017 payment structure rules are in force? Rather than helping employers to get cheap labour and introducing a system she knows will fail - and the Minister has heard the statistics in that regard - she should broaden and top up the schemes. She should commission an independent review. A 2009 report said that for every €1 spent, the quantifiable benefits amount to €2.89. The Minister should act now for her own sake."	spk_306

I want to tell the Minister and Minister of State about two boys from Kerry, James and Michael. They were left to the mercy of this State and suffered a horrendous childhood. They were boarded out from the county home in Killarney, County Kerry. James was eight and a half and Michael was seven. The State had a duty of care to these little children but sent them to work in servitude and enforced labour. ""You are here to work,"" they were told. The shameful story is of James and Michael Sugrue. They were sent to a house which had no lighting and no heating. They were not properly fed and having authorised their boarding out, there were no adequate inspections provided by the State. James, who is now 70, told me, again today, he was physically and sexually abused over many years. He was failed by the social workers who were supposed to protect him and when his education finished, his school and his council declined him a grant for further education on the basis that there would be no additional benefit to him. James went to Hammersmith and later made a life for himself in London, and has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. Michael was not so fortunate. Growing up, he had been beaten many, many times, and stripped and beaten in public with a stick on one occasion. He suffered with addiction and mental health and was found dead alone in Crystal Palace in 1993. This left a void in James's life which can never be replaced. Later in life, compounding this injustice, James was forgotten by every redress scheme. He was not recognised. He was denied a full Garda investigation. At every hand's turn, the State told him that there was nothing it could do. Why, having listened to James, is the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, continuing to ignore him? Offering counselling to a man at this stage of his life, he says, is an insult. Give them the comfort of redress, please. For once, in this State, let them be included, or will the Minister be like Michael's neighbour who said to James after his funeral that he was sorry about his brother, they heard his screams but they did nothing. That is the only apology that they have ever received."	spk_203
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-11-17	dail	33	Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2021 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_19	As the Minister said, this is a complex area. She spoke about the Prescription Act 1832, and in this regard she consulted with the Law Reform Commission, the Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council of Ireland, all of which were of the view that the doctrine of lost modern grant was the best way of establishing rights of way or easement. A fuller consultation is needed, however. I welcome this Bill and the work that has gone into it. I have been calling for legislation such as this and stating that it was necessary to deal with the issue. It is important that it is implemented, as the Minister said, before the deadline of 30 November, and I credit those who have been campaigning on this issue. I am not sure what the motivation was behind the introduction of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009. There was certainly a perception in rural areas that it was intended to benefit urban situations and transfers of land there. Whatever happened, no thought was given at the time to people who owned land in areas where their rights of way might have sometimes traversed up to 20 other folios to get to a public road. The sections being repealed were totally impractical and a nonsense and I commend the Minister for bringing forward this legislation. Obtaining the consent of another person might sound simple, but sometimes neighbouring land could have been registered, and I have come across cases like this myself, to someone 60 or 70 years ago. The person concerned might have passed away years ago and trying to obtain consent from his or her estate or tracking down relations could prove difficult. The Act also did not consider that sales would, and did, fall through because of the delays in registering the various rights of way. It also did not consider that solicitors would be unable to certify titles to lending institutions because of the inability to state that all the rights of way had been registered on the folios. In addition, the Act did not consider that banks would then be extra careful following what had happened during the boom times and that they would refuse to sanction mortgages, thereby causing further delays, or that they would seek that extra inquiries be undertaken which, in turn, would result in loan offers going out of date. Equally, it did not, as the Minister said, consider that unnecessary court cases would arise or that contracts would be left unsigned in markets which were fluctuating up and down. The Act also did not consider that land which had been used for agricultural purposes and rights of way would not have been registered and that rights of way for agricultural land would not apply to dwelling houses. Moreover, it did not consider that the Land Registry would raise queries, about unregistered land in particular, and cause further delays. Furthermore, it was not taken into account how impractical it would prove, in many cases, to require applicants to have to advertise in local papers for people who might wish to come forward with objections. Those sections, therefore, were totally and utterly out of touch with the reality of land ownership and the difficulties in that context in rural Ireland. It had been the case that a statutory declaration could be given that a house or land had been used without let and hindrance for 30 years or more. If the situation was not broken, then why try to amend or fix it? The Act of 2009 had introduced the provision whereby, in effect, a landowner had to go-cap-in-hand to a neighbour to seek consent to the registration of a right of way. There may not have been any difficulties, but I came across cases where there was a shared entrance of a very small space, for example, and even though it was going to be mutually beneficial to both sides for someone to sign a consent the people involved were just not prepared to do that because they did not want to give anything away. In that way, any simmering or underlying tensions could have been exacerbated. Inevitably, as well, there was going to be a cost involved if two, three, four or five landowners had to seek legal advice, obtain folios and speak to their solicitors. It was, therefore, going to be more expensive even before the possibility that any court case was going to ensue. Therefore, I welcome what the Minister has said. I agree with her that mandatory registration had not been working properly. I also welcome that the Minister has announced a review to take place before June of next year. That will all help. It will, hopefully, regularise the situation and allow more transactions and transfers to take place. Some of our team in the Seanad have proposed amendments. I am not going to talk about the foreshore side of things, however, and I hope that with the co-operation of all sides we can, indeed, facilitate the overturning of this difficult situation. The courts being closed during the pandemic also led to extra delays on top of the existing difficulties and the legal and practical complexities of registering rights of way were made even more difficult. I hope this legislation will go through the House speedily and I encourage that happening.	spk_273
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-11-16	dail	33	Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage	dbsect_20	I thank the Minister for her statement and I agree with many of her comments. It is a very important matter and a serious topic. As has been outlined by my colleague, Deputy Kenny, it is a complicated matter and it is not black and white. It is important for the victims of sexual violence and only this week we saw members of one family in the North speak out about violence they suffered. This took immense bravery and we must do all we can to support victims. We should look at the recommendations of Supporting a Victim's Journey and ensure the justice system can become more hospitable to those who have suffered while maintaining a proper balance between their need for justice and the rights we need to afford to defendants for a fair trial. At the same time, we must be mindful that resources and measures such as those proposed in the Bill are not sufficient by themselves and some of these crimes relate to a lack of social care or social work in many cases. We must provide resources for the Garda and others. The Minister mentioned reintegration into society, with which I will deal in a moment. I note Adult Safeguarding Day is this week and it is important to acknowledge that vulnerable people are at a far higher risk of becoming victims of sexual offences. As the Minister outlined, this Bill attempts to strengthen the legal basis to allow courts to ban convicted offenders from working with children and vulnerable adults, for example, which is important, given the risks outlined. In a similar vein, I have been examining possible amendments to the Garda vetting system that would improve its function. We saw one of the flaws in the current vetting system with recent attempts by hospitals to hire workers who have not been Garda vetted, leading to delays of six weeks, despite the people in question being Garda vetted for sports organisations and clubs and given a clean record. Another flaw in the current vetting system is a lack of any proactive requirement on gardaí to inform employers where an individual may be in contact with vulnerable people when a conviction occurs after the vetting has concluded. I hope to introduce a Bill that would go some way to addressing that matter. Placing the SORAM programme on a statutory footing is also a good idea, as the Minister mentioned. The SORAM currently operates on a non-statutory basis, as she outlined, but the information shared between the various agencies will only be as good as the resources provided to them. Tusla, in particular, is struggling to recruit qualified staff and this must be addressed. There is also a matter to be addressed within the wider criminal justice system relating to these crimes. Although the register contains largely only the most serious of sexual crimes, its expansion should be considered carefully. It is important to get the legislation right and although we are happy to support it through to the next Stage, some provisions may need to be addressed. The proposed section 14B(2) indicates that a representative of a housing authority may be included in the panel of risk assessment but it does not mention what qualifications that person must have in such an important role. The proposed section indicates that any member of the team can share information with his or her own organisation or body to effectively assess and manage the offender and risk of harm to the community afterwards, which seems quite loose to me. The provision may need to be strengthened. The team, as constituted, should have to make that decision to share information and there should be conditions for doing so. It looks quite informal and subjective, lacking in transparency or having sufficient reasons to do so in individual cases. With regard to the proposed section 14E, it is always important to maintain proper records for any type of system where there are severe consequences for somebody's liberty. For example, if a person is arrested for questioning in a Garda station and the period is extended by 12 hours, a proper record must be kept. The proposed section 14E refers to an inspector disclosing information but that should be a superintendent. He or she should have to record the decision in writing, just as is done when detention is being extended. There is an overall lack of record keeping in the legislation and the relevant parties should certify if they decide to do something and the grounds used. Any garda giving such a direction should be required to send a notification to the Garda Commissioner and a report on the use of this section should be required every year. The lack of such record keeping in a central repository could be troublesome in years to come if it were used in the wrong way. We are sometimes only a High Court case away from a system collapsing so it is important to get it right. The proposed section 14F allows a person to make a submission against the proposed disclosure but it only gives five days to do so. I am intrigued as to why the seven-day period was reduced. Is this just to bring it in line with British legislation or were there complaints from An Garda Síochána that led to the period being reduced to three days? It gives five days to make a submission against the proposed disclosure but there is no provision for legal assistance. The period allowed seems quite short. The proposed section 16C in the principal Act refers to contractual arrangements being put in place to monitor compliance, but what type of contractual arrangements does the Minister envisage? Some other provisions can be dealt with on Committee Stage but it is important we get this right. Reckless lawmaking could mean a victim could eventually suffer if some provisions were struck down as unconstitutional. As I indicated earlier, there are also some problems with addressing the rehabilitation and reintegration of prisoners. Having spoken with prison governors over the years, I know many, if not most, people who have been convicted of sexual offences do not engage with counselling programmes in prisons. If they did, it would prevent repeat offending and keep communities safe. Difficult decisions may have to be taken to ensure more of them engage to keep communities safe. Sexual offenders are correctly seen as offenders who are different from others but the integrity of the wider criminal rehabilitative system must be maintained. I look forward to examining the Bill further on Committee Stage.	spk_237
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-11-16	dail	33	National Ambulance Service: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_21	Last week, Deputy Cullinane and I met with representatives of the National Ambulance Service to discuss the crisis at University Hospital Kerry. While we were there, problems with the ambulance service came up time and again because they are intrinsically linked. Nearly every day, my office is contacted by people who cannot get healthcare due to the ongoing crisis. Worryingly, a common concern is the inability to get an ambulance service. People are referred to the emergency department by their GPs or they have an emergency but must wait hours for an ambulance. It is commonplace to hear of ambulances being sent from Limerick and Cork to take Kerry people to University Hospital Kerry, and  Before coming to the Chamber, I spoke to Ms Rita Sheehy, who worked in medical practice for almost 20 years. She said that things went from bad to worse six years ago when the call centres were centralised. She told me one ambulance from her area went to Rosscarbery last weekend while another went to Union Hall. The Kenmare ambulance ended up in Waterford. I am not sure, given the crisis in healthcare in Kerry, that there is an understanding we have three peninsulas in our spread-out county, with the resources for only 150,000 people. We do not even have that. We have a population during the summer months of close to 500,000 people and the services are clearly not there. Young children and elderly people end up being driven to hospital by family members, which creates risk and places parents and family members in a bind. Should they wait for paramedics to come or risk driving their loved one to hospital before it is too late? People must face these choices due to the lack of ambulances in Kerry. I previously asked the Minister to base ambulances in Killorglin and Abbeyfeale. Both areas are adjacent to communities grossly underserved in normal times and feel completely abandoned during this crisis. I again invite the Minister to come to Kerry, go to the hospital, meet people and meet with the ambulance service. I am hearing more stories of ambulances waiting for hours to transfer patients into hospital. It is common to hear of five-hour waits and sometimes eight-hour waits. Staff shortages and a lack of beds mean highly vulnerable patients and paramedics are waiting too long to be seen. It is not good enough. The Minister needs to take action. I urge him to do something before it is too late and someone loses his or her life.	spk_246

We have had to speak to a number of Bills like this connected with transnational crime this year and the Bill is very much in keeping with that. On one hand, the challenges posed by the crimes of trafficking persons very much require collaboration. On the other hand we must mark out our own policy, informed by the humanitarian reasons why so many people are falling into the hands of traffickers. As long as there continues to be war and bloodshed around the world, especially with climate change, people will seek to move across the world and will, in general, gravitate to the global north. The 2020 trafficking report from the US State Department indicates this clearly. The Government has not obtained a trafficking conviction since the law was amended in 2013, which weakened deterrence, contributed to immunity for traffickers and undermined efforts to support victims to testify. Perhaps this Bill may come some way to addressing the problem but resources must be provided as well. Kerry has one of the longest coastlines in the entire country, making it a prime site for potential trafficking. What plans are being made to address this and provide for anti-trafficking efforts along the west coast as part of ongoing reforms? As mentioned by Deputy Devlin, I am also interested in the HSE team in place to help the people who are victims of human trafficking. The recent release of the Facebook papers highlighted how it and other social media platforms have been used as markets for people. Sometimes we are a little deferential to these companies but as a key regulatory and economic hub for the newly renamed Meta, we have a serious role to play in addressing the use of these social networks in general and particularly in this context when they are used by traffickers. I look forward to seeing that.	spk_283

I support it going to Committee Stage and allowing for further debate because it gets to the heart of the difficulties facing our credit union movement. I also commend the movement for working so hard and so professionally in their submissions to suggest many of the policy solutions causing difficulties for them and their thousands of members across the island. I do not have to list the many benefits credit unions have brought to Irish life, from allowing people who are not accommodated by the mainstream banks to access loans and mortgages to its commitment to maintaining hundreds of jobs in our town and village centres. Towns such as Castleisland, Killorglin and Causeway were abandoned by court services and by mainstream banks, but continue to be serviced by credit unions. During lockdown, the only life in some town centres was in the queue outside the credit union. I welcome the amendments to include the provision of mutual services and the provision whereby the Central Bank of Ireland would be obliged to seek and obtain consent of the Minister for Finance when prescribing minimum regulatory reserve requirements. The current ratio of 10% of the assets is much more than what is required for high street banks and credit unions in other countries. Capital requirements mean that the sector has had to compete with banks with one hand tied behind its back. The credit unions lost millions of euro to mainstream banks as a result of the capping of deposits.  Discrimination in favour of the main banks has to stop. Obliging the Central Bank of Ireland to have regard to the common bond of other credit unions must also be discussed on Committee Stage. I am happy to support our credit unions and support this Bill on Second Stage.	spk_27
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-11-02	dail	33	Nurses and Midwives: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_20	I support this motion. The thing that strikes me most when I speak to nurses is how undervalued they feel. Is it any wonder? There are staff shortages. Nurses are exhausted and stressed and did not receive childcare support at the beginning of the pandemic when they were crying out for it. They did not have access to support staff in pharmacies, adequate security, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, or even adequate catering. Some that I spoke to were just told to get on with it. There seems to be no strategic vision and strategy in the hospital groups. This can clearly be demonstrated in the example of a haematologist, recently employed in University Hospital Kerry, who was not even supplied with a microscope when he started work. Essential services must be kept, but you can only centralise so much. I ask the Minister to listen to what the nurses are saying. The consultants in University Hospital Kerry, in an unprecedented move, wrote a five-page letter to the South/South West Hospital Group demanding change in the hospital. Too many nurses are doing non-nursing duties. I ask the Minister to employ more nurses and keep the existing staff that have been there for many years by valuing them. I ask the Minister to be flexible with those who want to work, but want to work fewer hours. We must build isolation rooms, more beds and wards, cath labs and an oncology unit at the hospital. Having just four nurses in a 30-bed ward is unsafe. If the Minister cannot do any of this, will he at least get them a proper staffroom and changing rooms? The current situation is unsafe.	spk_225

Last Friday, I met a women in north Kerry. Her son is four years old and has a rare chromosome deficiency, Kleefstra syndrome, which causes him to have difficulties communicating. I met him too and he has problems with his gait and needs early intervention now. He is not getting services. Time and again, over the past few weeks in particular, I have met parents who can afford to pay €150 per week for the necessary interventions but, unfortunately, and the enraging part about it is, this woman and her child are awaiting ear, nose and throat, ENT, appointments, paediatric services and cardiology appointments for up to two years. He rarely sees occupational therapists and speech therapists, he needs housing adaptation and he sees Kerry Intervention and Disability Services in Listowel for approximately two days per month. He is not developing as he should and is falling behind in his potential. The frustrating thing is that rather than having a clear treatment plan prepared for him over the past two years, since he was diagnosed, his mother is waiting. She is another mother waiting and he is another child with unrealised potential. He should not have to rely on the courts and Bills such as this if the authorities really believe in equal opportunities for all. She should not have to figure this out on her own. I also recently met a speech and language therapist who told me that in 2011, approximately, the number of speech therapists going through universities was tripled but the jobs were not there when they came out, so they all went to Canada and Australia. We are falling behind. Early intervention needs to happen now, we need more occupational therapists, OTs, and more ancillary services, and not just for people who can afford to dig into their own pockets.	spk_27
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-10-19	dail	33	Access of Competent Authorities to Centralised Bank Account Registries: Motion	dbsect_13	This is the latest in a series of motions we have had to consider regarding international co-operation to fight organised crime. Given the fact that criminal gangs are, like most enterprises, becoming larger, more sophisticated and increasingly transnational, the response to them must also advance in the same respect. Accordingly, I am happy to speak in favour of the motion. There remain, however, some aspects of how we deal with money laundering in this jurisdiction that leave something to be desired. Enabling legislation for other EU directives and regulations in the area of anti-money laundering was slow, such that the State ran the risk of sanction for non-compliance. The defence for corporate entities inserted into that legislation when it eventually came before the House may be necessitated by case law, but it will be very interesting to see how that may play out. Unfortunately, there are few chances of banks and other entities being brought before the courts on these charges. As other speakers outlined, it will be people at the bottom of the chain who will face the rigours of the court. Given the poor resources offered to some of the institutions, of necessity, it will be the low-hanging fruit that will be picked off. Let us make no mistake, the Government cannot beat its chest about tackling organised crime until this area is addressed properly. White-collar crime enables drug debts throughout the State to be collected and laundered and we cannot tackle one without the other. While anti-money laundering legislation is welcome for the reasons I have outlined, there is an unintended side effect. Regulation means the likes of the credit unions and post offices must dedicate more resources to this work, hindering the operation of such vital, local institutions. The fall in the past 18 months in social welfare payments meant their viability was affected and it has not been balanced by any extra commercial activities. The recent decision to help out the Bank of Ireland is not going to cut the mustard. The Grant Thornton report must be implemented. All Deputies probably received an email from the postmasters about a fortnight ago.I support them. The Government should intervene and give the extra investment to the post offices. As the report suggested, there will be an additional social benefit to the community of between €334 million and €700 million. It is for that reason that we must not take our eye off the ball. The Government should act fast in regard to supporting post offices around the country.	spk_224
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-10-13	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 2: General (Resumed)	dbsect_19	If Sinn Féin were in government, I would like to think we would look at the issues and challenges both in Kerry and around the country: health, housing lists, the cost of living and disability services. What would €100 million have done for more occupational therapists, psychologists and speech and language therapists for the people who have been suffering for years unless they can afford to pay €150 per week for those services?We would look at how we can improve the situation in the country after the Covid period. When I was driving to Dublin yesterday morning and heard on the radio that the Taoiseach's plan was for a return to normal, I was worried this would not be a budget of change and the necessary changes would not be introduced. I was concerned, for example, that it would not make provision for a right to retire at 65 years of age. I was worried there would be no ambitious social and affordable housing programme. Both the ESRI and Sinn Féin sought a doubling of investment in social and affordable housing to deliver 20,000 homes. The Government will provide eight affordable homes this year. The specific urgency that is required has not been shown. There is no plan to tackle the crisis in our healthcare service. At a three-hour meeting on Monday with management at University Hospital Kerry, we discussed the need for capital projects for extra wards, the plans for two of which have lain on a desk in Dublin since the previous meeting we had with management last November. There are problems with the provision of acute beds and with staffing. There is nothing in the budget for student nurses. No wonder there is a staffing crisis and nurses are emigrating. The Government supported our motion to pay student nurses but there is nothing in the budget in that regard. There is no vision for the health service. It is no wonder that people tasked with implementing Sláintecare are leaving their posts. In the budget for 2016, GP care was promised for under-12s. Six years on, we have reached the under-eights. There is also no vision or plan to deliver Irish unity. As I read the leaks over the past week about what would be in the budget, all my fears were realised. It signals a return to a normal in which there are the same exorbitant childcare costs and an increase, not a decrease, in the cost of living through the introduction of additional carbon taxes, which will be unfairly borne by workers, retired people and their families. The ESRI says this measure will be ineffective. There will be no climate justice for people in this country. The measures in the budget will penalise people rather than incentivise them. In the past 12 months, the cost of home heating oil has risen by 39%. For an older person who has to pay for private healthcare and an increased property tax, these new costs will simply be unaffordable. The budget marks a return to the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael normal of giving the banks a break, retaining childcare costs that are the highest in Europe, and overseeing a situation where fees are too high and wages are too low. The zoned land tax will be charged at only 3% and will not kick in for two years. The sixth budget Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have presented is one lacking in ambition. Like the national development plan, it is a tired roll-out of old plans and old ideas. It has been said that the leaders of the three parties in government are like three emperors with no clothes. In fact, they have clothes, but they are old clothes. As in the children's book, 	spk_250
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-10-07	dail	33	Ceisteanna ar Reachtaíocht a Gealladh - Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_33	I raise the issue of the thousands of children in the State who have developmental difficulties. Being the parent of a child who has these difficulties or challenges is a cause of lingering and continuing stress and worry. Early intervention can make the difference, as I know, between a full life and one that is significantly diminished. Assessments are taking place but therapies are not available. Training unqualified parents is not satisfactory. Some parents who have contacted me can afford to pay the average €150 per week on speech and language therapy, cognitive tests, occupational therapy, autism spectrum disorder assessments, psychologists and paediatricians and avoid three-year waiting lists. A three-year wait is too long for a family and for their suffering child. Will the Tánaiste intervene?	spk_216
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-10-06	dail	33	The National Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027 and Supporting Community Safety: Statements	dbsect_14	As Deputy Martin Kenny said, Sinn Féin broadly welcomes this strategy. It takes the right approach and, hopefully, will be backed by investment. The key is that the strategy mentions the need for contact with vulnerable youth to take place at an earlier stage than when they have offended. Providing supports at that age is all well and good, but it is often too late. The links between socio-economic circumstances, child and welfare issues, and offending are also examined in the report. The policies of austerity deprived many poorer communities of jobs, resources and capital. It is somewhat ironic that those who implemented those policies are spearheading a strategy in this area that acknowledges how detrimental those wider economic and social policies were. There is no substitute for decent working conditions, fair employment and well-resourced schools. We should not be in a position where interventions are only available once the offending takes place, even though that is the correct approach in isolation. We must also identify and help children who are exposed to trauma at an early age. On its own merits, the strategy is a good one. The first part of it relates to the focus on diverting young people from the formal youth justice system. if possible, and the use of detention as a last resort. In my years working in the Bridewell courts and Tralee, I saw the good work that was done in keeping people away from the courts and ensuring they did not get a criminal record which would hamstring them for the rest of their working career. Detention is something we should avoid no matter what age the person is, if at all possible, but it has a particular effect on minors. Their development may be stunted and their future severely compromised as they struggle to adapt away from wider society and educational opportunities. The second part deals with restorative justice, which the strategy mentions numerous times. This is welcome but lacks detail. With adult offenders, restorative justice is much underused officially and should be promoted further and institutionalised. Without a solid track record with adult cases, it would be interesting to see how this is implemented for children. The rights and voices of victims are important but it is fair to say that given the nature of most crimes committed by minors and their potential to turn themselves around, many victims would support and accept restorative justice measures. It is a rhetorical sleight of hand to always equate the victim's voice with harsher and more punitive measures. I hope this strategy will undermine that practice somewhat. The language of the document is largely positive but it will need to be backed by proper intent. For instance, the youth justice oversight group seems good on paper, but why is there not an ambition for a proper youth justice agency such as there is in Scotland? Co-ordination between agencies is fine in principle but in practice budgets, reporting lines and functionality all matter.A strategy to which all adhere is good, but more of the actual responsibility falling on a specific body would have been progress. The fact that some youth justice functions transferred from the Department of Justice to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth last year is a case in point, as this strategy presumes greater co-operation while leaving much of the structure untouched. The transfer is also of concern because it could end up with youth justice as an afterthought within adult justice systems, something that a more comprehensive reform would have changed. Although the strategy is a step in the right direction, we will eagerly await its implementation.	spk_190

Mhol Teachta Dála de chuid Fhine Gael, an Teachta O'Dowd, é in 2003 chun an seanmhíniú ar ""cúirt"" san Acht a fheabhsú. Baineann sé seo le héagóir atá ann. Tá cearta teanga ann i mbinsí fiosrúcháin ar leith ach níl siad ann i mbinsí eile. Srianann an tAcht cearta teanga cúirte do bhinsí a bunaíodh faoi na hAchtanna a bhí i bhfeidhm roimh 2002 amháin. I gcás binsí nua fiosrúcháin a bunaíodh ó shin agus iad a bhunófar amach anseo, an Coimisiún um Chaidreamh san Áit Oibre a bunaíodh in 2015 ina measc, is cosúil nach bhfuil aon cheart ag Gaeilgeoirí labhairt os a gcomhair ina dteanga féin. Is fadhb í seo a d'aithin an Teachta O'Dowd beagnach 20 bliain ó shin. Ní cóir go mbeadh orainn í a phlé, fiú ag an staid seo, ach an reachtaíocht a thabhairt suas chun dáta ionas go mbeadh aon bhinse bunaithe ag aon chomhlacht poiblí ag am ar bith clúdaithe. Mar a dúirt an Teachta Ó Snodaigh, nuair a deireann breitheamh chomh sinsearach leis an mBreitheamh Úna Ní Raifeartaigh nach bhfuil cearta cothroma ag dream amháin, b'éigean don Rialtas aire a thabhairt di. Dúirt sí go bhfuil na cúirteanna ag cuidiú le linguicide ina aghaidh na teanga agus nach bhfuil seirbhís leordhóthanach ar fáil in aon chor. Níl leasú ar bith ag an Rialtas chun an cúiseamh sin a fhreagairt ach go bhfuil sé ag amharc ar chinneadh statutory instruments a aistriú go Gaolainn in am réasúnta. Ní chreideann an Rialtas seo i gcearta teanga. Táim bródúil leasú Uimh. 39 a thabhairt os comhair na Dála faoina mbeadh ceart ag daoine seirbhísí aistriúcháin bhéil chomhuaineach a bheith acu. Dúirt an tAire Stáit sa chomhchoiste go gcreideann sé go bhfuil an córas ag obair faoi láthair in ainneoin na fianaise agus an méid a dúirt an Breitheamh Uí Raifeartaigh. Tá sé soiléir nach raibh aon teagmháil ag an Aire Stáit le daoine a bhí ag iarraidh a gcearta a fháil sna cúirteanna. Gheall an tAire Stáit go bpléifeadh sé leasú leis an tSeirbhís Cúirteanna agus go mbeadh sé ar ais le leasú dá chuid féin. An raibh aon chruinniú ann? Ní bheadh aon fhadhb leis na cúirteanna Eorpacha leis sin. Is trua nach bhfuil dearbhú anseo. Baineann leasuithe Uimh. 40 go dtí 42, go huile, 47 agus 48 le cearta do dhaoine a gcásanna a phlé as Gaeilge. Fúthu, bheadh breitheamh nó giúiré in ann an Ghaolainn a thuiscint. Ba chóir go mbeadh cáipéisí cúirte sa teanga is fearr leis an duine atá os comhair na cúirte. Níl an t-éileamh sin míréasúnta. Dá mbeadh ar dhuine a labhraíonn an Béarla a chás nó a cás a phlé i nGaeilge, bheadh raic ann. I dtír inar crochadh duine sa Teach Dóite 250 bliain ó shin, cén fáth go bhfuil sé all right go mbeadh duine ón nGaeltacht curtha san áit chéanna inniu? Chuir an Rialtas na riachtanais go mbeadh leibhéal Gaeilge áirithe ag dlíodóirí agus aturnaetha ar ceal in 2008. Bhí ar gach dlíodóir beagáinín Gaeilge a bheith aige nó aici. Anois, níl Gaeilge shásúil acu agus tá fadhbanna againn le breithiúna a fháil a bhfuil Gaeilge acu. Tá an baol ann nach mbeadh Gaeilge ag breitheamh sa Chúirt Uachtarach, áit a bhfuil dualgais ar bhreithiúna Bunreacht na hÉireann a thuiscint as Gaolainn. Faoi leasú Uimh. 50, bheadh ar 20% de dhlíodóirí nua an Ghaeilge a bheith acu faoi 2030. Is é sin an aidhm chéanna atá ann do na seirbhísí poiblí. Molaim na leasuithe sin."	spk_262

Seo masla ar chearta mionlaigh. Bhí mé féin ag déileáil le duine éigin a sheol iarratas pleanála go dtí an chomhairle contae agus bhí an freagra a cuireadh ar ais chucu go léir as Béarla. Tá a lán leasuithe againn faoi sheirbhísí Stáit, ó sheirbhísí sláinte go dtí An Garda Síochána, chun a chinntiú go mbeadh siad ar fáil as Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht faoi spriocdháta ar leith, ach idir an gilitín agus neamhaird an Aire Stáit, nár chuir leasuithe suntasacha faoin nGaeltacht sa Bhille é féin, ní bheidh tagairt do na cearta teanga sin sa Bhille nuair a achtaítear é. I dtíortha eile, bíonn cearta teanga sonraithe go soiléir. Tá an Chairt Eorpach do Theangacha Réigiúnacha nó Mionlaigh i bhfeidhm ag an gComhairle Eorpach, rud a thugann meicníocht idirnáisiúnta do Ghaeilgeoirí sna Sé Chontae sásamh a fháil ar a gcearta teanga agus níl feidhm ag an gcairt sa Stát seo. B'fhéidir gur chóir machnamh a dhéanamh ar an gcairt seo a shíneadh.

Dúirt Dubhghlas de hÍde, ""I hope and trust a native Irish Government will be induced to provide for the restoration of our place-names on something like a rational basis."" Dúirt Brian Friel chomh maith gur sórt díbirt, nó a sort of eviction, a bhí sna logainmneacha sin. Sin 100 bliain ó shin agus níl an aisling sin ann faoi láthair. Ní rabhamar in ann é seo a phlé ar Chéim an Choiste de réir costas ach níl sé ródhéanach é sin a athrú. Deir Airteagal 8 den Bhunreacht gur an Ghaolainn chéad teanga an Stáit ach tá na comharthaí bóithre agus sráide i gcoinne sprid an Bhunreachta sin. Bhíomar ag caint leis an gCoimisinéir Teanga ón mBreatain Bheag coicís ó shin agus tá na logainmneacha aistrithe aige ansin. Sa Ghaeltacht in Albain, tá an Béarla agus an Gàidhlig sa font céanna agus níl ach an dath athraithe. In Éirinn, áfach, tá na logainmneacha in italics agus sin masla don chultúr agus don teanga. Is meon coilínithe atá ann, a deir gur an Béarla an teanga real agus go bhfuil an Ghaolainn i bhfad níos lú. Bhí mé ag caint le duine a bhí ar ais ón Astráil cúpla bliain ó shin. Bhí sé ag caint faoi Uluru in aghaidh Ayers Rock ach ní deir sé an Baile Beag in aghaidh Ballybeg nó Sceichín an Rince in aghaidh Skeheenarinky. Tá sé sin beagáinín ceangailte leis an ábhar seo. Tá orainn an éagóir a cheartú agus bhí na logainmneacha a bhain leis an timpeallacht agus le daoine a bhí ina gcónaí ann na blianta ó shin aistrithe go seafóideach. Tá súil agam go ndéanfaimid rud mar gheall air sin. Leagtar amach bunchearta teanga sa chairt seo maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge le comhlachtaí poiblí agus cuideachtaí eile, in aon tionól poiblí ó thaobh oibre, i gcás earraí agus seirbhísí agus san oideachas. Seo an dea-chleachtas idirnáisiúnta agus ba chóir dúinn foghlaim ó sin. Beidh riachtanas ar leith ag pobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta agus mar sin bheadh fiúntas ag baint le tuarascáil a ullmhú chun moltaí agus spriocanna ama réalaíoch agus pobalbhunaithe a chur chun cinn.

Bhí na hainmneacha nádúrtha agus bhí a lán staire agus timpeallacht iontu ag an am sin. Um an dtaca sin, tugadh ainmneacha seafóideacha uaireanta. Tugadh Snave ar an áit in iarthar Chorcaí darb ainm Snámh. Luaigh mé Skeheenarinky cheana féin, cé gur Sceichín an Rince an t-ainm air. Is amhlaidh an scéal in Úlla i Luimneach. Labhair mé mar gheall ar an play ag Brian Friel faoin trauma a tharla ag an am sin. Is trua go bhfuil toradh na tragóide sin ann faoi láthair. Thart ar 100 bliain ó shin, aistríodh roinnt ainmneacha ar nós Dún Laoghaire agus Port Laoise. Ní raibh aon fhadhb leis sin agus is féidir leis an bpobal na hainmneacha a úsáid. D'aistrigh sinn féin é sin agus beimid bródúil as. Nuair a bhíomar ag caint leis an gCoimisinéir Teanga ón mBreatain Bheag, dúirt sé nach raibh aon chostas ag baint leis na comharthaí bóthair a d'aistrigh siad go cinn nua. Ní raibh aon chostas breise toisc go raibh na comharthaí á athrú acu ar aon nós. Tá eisceachtaí ann nuair a bhíonn ainmneacha i dteangacha eile a tháinig chun na tíre leis na Lochlannaigh, na Normannaigh, nó daoine as Albain nó Uladh. D'fhéadfadh go mbeadh eisceachtaí ann mar gheall ar chúrsaí turasóireachta agus mar sin de. Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh na hainmneacha Gaeilge chun tosaigh agus suite níos airde nó ar an leibhéal céanna leis an ainm Sasanach nó Béarla. Má tá sé ar intinn ag an tAire Stáit na leasuithe seo a dhiúltú, déarfainn leis go dtugann siad a lán soiléireacht agus míniú don teanga agus nach mbeadh aon chostas breise ag baint leo. Cúpla seachtain ó shin, bhíos ag caint le daoine i nDún Chaoin a bhí ag iarraidh clós súgartha a thógáil ina gceantar. Tá orm mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Office of Public Works agus an tUasal Ó Buachalla a bhí i bhfabhar é sin chun taispeántas agus ráiteas a dhéanamh ionas go mbeadh an Ghaolainn feicthe sa phobal agus seans a thabhairt do dhaoine agus leanaí a bheith ag caint as Gaolainn sa phobal. Dá mbeadh na comharthaí bóthair le feiceáil agus daoine ag tiomáint, bheadh sé sin i bhfad níos fearr. Dúirt an coimisinéir ón Bhreatain Bheag nach féidir an t-ainm Swansea a fheiceáil ar na bóithre. Is é Abertawe an t-aon ainm a fheictear nuair a bhítear ag tiomáint ansin. Sin iad mo thuairimí ar an leasú seo."	spk_365

Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-09-28	dail	33	Hospital Waiting Lists: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_17	Last Friday I met a woman from mid-Kerry in the front room of her house. There was a beautiful view looking out over Castlemaine Harbour. She has been battling and beating cancer for the past ten years. She has a young family, one of whom returned home from school as we spoke. Every three weeks, she receives treatment in University Hospital Kerry for three hours with six or seven others. She knows all the staff by their first names. She had the height of praise for everybody in the unit. The people of Kerry are very proud of all the nurses who work there. The woman is comforted by the backup services in the university hospital, including the physiotherapy and scanning facilities. It seemed strange to me until recently that the unit has been borrowing wards from other departments. The most vulnerable are affected. What awaits the woman with the amazing view are anxiety and concern because it seems that, rather than investing in space to treat those affected, the authorities will outsource treatment to a private hospital. I do not know the financial cost but there will be no ancillary services in that hospital. Nurses say there will be a risk to health and safety and that if people become unwell, they will have to be blue-lighted from one end of the town to the other. Is the Government waiting for a charity to pick up the pieces for the unit? Recently, in the past couple of days, there has been more depressing news from University Hospital Kerry. Surgeons there sent a letter to GPs stating facilities are not available there anymore. Elective surgeries have been curtailed for four weeks running. Things are falling apart. We in the office are receiving call after call about people having to wait for an hour for an ambulance. The situation is not sustainable. Nurses who have given their heart and soul to the hospital are leaving, and surgeons have written to GPs stating 2,200 patients are waiting to be seen in the surgical outpatients department. They say protected surgical daybeds have been taken over for emergency purposes. The also say nursing and infrastructure shortages mean the service the people of Kerry deserve cannot be provided any longer. Non-urgent surgical referrals can no longer be accepted. I ask the Government to do something about that.	spk_263
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-09-22	dail	33	Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I wish to register my support for the Bill and commend the Labour Party on bringing it forward. On the ground in County Kerry, there has been a crisis in housing going back to 2011 when the decisions were made to stop building social housing and to abolish town councils, which exacerbated a difficult situation. I welcome in particular the provisions of the Bill relating to security and standards. It is a sound Bill overall and it is worthy of support. Tenants and renters in County Kerry have experienced a significant degree of vulnerability in recent years. Every week or two, I meet people whose rent has been increased. They are put into panic because they anticipate that they will get a notice or they have received a notice, although, in fairness, the notice is usually in compliance with the standards as outlined. However if one is, like a man I met during the week, a separated man of 72 years of age looking for a place to live, maybe for the rest of one's days, and one has received a notice, it can make one's life come crumbling down. In 2020, Kerry experienced the largest rent increases in the country for that calendar year. According to the latest Daft.ie report, a 16.5% year-on-year increase occurred in the second quarter of this year. Rather than deflating the market, Covid-19 has stoked it.  This has not been helped by the Government's recent plan, which has seen rents increase as the Minister's plan lacks credibility. A chronic shortage of housing, combined with a large number of second homes and holiday homes, particularly in County Kerry, has given rise to this situation. The market is pitched heavily towards landlords and there is a need to rebalance and address that discrepancy through the law. The Bill will tighten the grounds for evicting current tenants under the exemptions offered for family members. In reality, this has been shoddily enforced. Major institutional landlords have used it, farcically listing their own company name as being in need of a property for a relative. For those reasons alone, I support the Bill.	spk_61
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-09-22	dail	33	Ceisteanna ar Reachtaíocht a Gealladh - Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_10	The crisis in University Hospital Kerry is becoming critical. Day procedures have been cancelled for the third week running, the hospital is short 100 nurses, orthopaedic services have been outsourced and ambulances are queuing up because the patients they are offloading are not being taken into the accident and emergency department. A scanning machine in the hospital can be used by only private patients. No wonder it is difficult to recruit surgeons for that hospital, given that they would be dealing with the most difficult of cases. In a county that is already disadvantaged by peripherality, a hospital that had to deal with an increased population of up to 500,000 during the summer will be stretched coming into the winter period. If University Hospital Kerry is to be downgraded, will the Government come out and say it or else will it intervene, provide the resources necessary for proper services, commit to a plan for re-establishing day procedures, as there seems to be none, and meet local representatives and consultants?	spk_149
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-09-21	dail	33	EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Motion	dbsect_8	This interim measure to approve the sharing of data is a topic on which many people will have mixed feelings. The withdrawal of the UK from the European Union has been chaotic and is now proving to be a mess across a range of areas. The Government and the EU have got many things right. The sharing of data as part of the Prüm Convention may not be as high profile as other issues but it is nonetheless important. This is for the simple reason that criminal gangs are becoming increasingly organised. They are getting larger and they are starting to collaborate. The model is changing for these groups. They are subject to the same business or capitalist forces as everybody else and an oligopoly is now emerging among gangs in Europe. A transnational response is necessary and requires data sharing to continue. For this reason, I support, with reservations, the extension of these measures. Ironically, the UK was one of the most frequent users of the measures and other databases. However, as in many other areas, the UK Government talked tough on Brexit and crime but then cut itself off from the resources to tackle it. As ever, there is a danger of overreach in the use of newer technologies in fighting crime. We must be vigilant in that regard. The EU is creating a database called Eurodac that will store details of migrants, including children, coming into Europe. In the aftermath of the Snowden revelations about National Security Agency, NSA, surveillance in the US, we need to be increasingly careful about the retention of data. In this instance, the data are distinguished by the fact they are stored by police only after individuals come into contact with the force as part of criminal law processes, rather than their being maintained for all persons as part of the normal course of events. However, not everyone who comes into contact with police is guilty of any offence. These databases should be strictly supervised. We can all agree that the Garda PULSE system was not strictly supervised for a long time. It should have had regular audits and been accessed only in accordance with the law. We also need to remain conscious of developments within other EU member states as the law is frequently used in ways with which we may not agree. In the case of Catalan political activists or LGBTQ activists arrested in Poland, for example, will their details be on this database and, if so, is that in line with the European values that underpin the Union? We must not be afraid to be critical and vigilant with regard to national and transnational co-operation on crime, even as we accept the necessity for its existence.	spk_129

He and two of his brothers were boarded out at the mercy of the State and abandoned at the county home in Killarney where they suffered a horrendous experience. Mr. Sugrue spoke to An Taoiseach a few months ago and was promised that his case, and the cases of people like him, will be looked at. People who were boarded out were not part of the mother and baby inquiry and were not subject to the Ryan report or the Kennedy review, but the case for recognition and apology to them and for legislation that will, eventually, lead to redress is unanswerable.

Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-07-14	dail	33	Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2021: Second Stage	dbsect_12	This legislation puts forward yet another poorly-thought-out system. Throughout the pandemic, the Government has overly relied on the criminal law rather than public health guidance. At a meeting of the justice committee, representatives from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, said it is a sense of solidarity and togetherness that makes people comply with health advice, not fines and imprisonment. There has been no training or guidance for the staff in the hospitality sector that are expected to enforce the use of the pass. A restaurant owner in south Kerry asked who came up with this scheme because neither he nor any of his colleagues were consulted or asked for their opinion. Numerous hospitality businesses have no idea how they will use the pass, and many have no desire to use it. These businesses have spent small fortunes reorganising and reopening. A publican in Listowel told me that like others he had invested in Covid-19 containment measures, and his staff have adapted with patience and a commitment to get through the pandemic together but he too feels that his voice is not being heard. The new system has been described variously to me as chaotic, apartheid, unworkable, unenforceable and unfair. What consideration was given to keeping supports with a reduced capacity like last summer? We have just a cobbled together plan and the usual tweets and leaks. I appreciate that the Government is comfortable with a two-tier system. The over-60s are waiting for their second vaccination and many people are unable to avail of a vaccine. They struggled through the pandemic. They do not deserve to be excluded from going for a meal. Many worry about what is next in a two-tier Ireland. Will the system be introduced in libraries, museums or shops? Young people will not be able to go to a bar or restaurant with their friends. They sacrificed personal freedoms and their mental health. They feel discriminated against. What will it be next? Will some businesses be excluded with only an hour's notice? I was contacted by Kerry businesses, Pavilion Amusements in Ballybunion and Bowling Buddies in Tralee. They reopened after significant planning and investment but then were visited by gardaí who said they had to close them down because the regulations and legislation had changed again. Light-touch regulation will only increase the unenforceability of the legislation. We are certainly not all in this together.	spk_315
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-07-07	dail	33	Post Office Network: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_7	It seems barely a week goes by without us discussing more decline in rural life in Ireland. It is important we are having this discussion about post offices, which often remain the only focal point in some villages. We are stuck in an awful cycle of depopulation, downgrading of services, lack of investment, employment and then more depopulation. In the Listowel-north County Kerry area we have seen the threat to the SouthDoc service, the removal of dental services, the closure of the Courts Service office and now the removal of a Garda superintendent from the area. After talking for years about Shannon liquefied natural gas, LNG, rather than doing anything about it, the Government's idea now is just to introduce a task force which will kick the problem of depopulation and lack of employment further down the line. I have said before we cannot hope to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic on the cheap, and investment in rural communities will help our spatial strategy, environment and aid public health. Rather than removing services such as the pension and social welfare during the pandemic, post offices have been further disadvantaged by the removal of the passport service and by the online service which is taking longer. Consequently, post offices are losing more business. In the new contract, the top-up payments have been removed from the beginning of this month and that is another disadvantage for anyone minded to stay in business. There is a way to improve services, as was revealed in the recent reports. While the €8.5 million is welcome, that is over 18 months rather than what was recommended by Grant Thornton, which was €17 million over 12 months. Thus in effect, only one third of the recommended amount is to be provided to post offices. A proper public service obligation should be the cornerstone of this approach, as we have seen recently with County Kerry's regional airport. This would help people of working age either to relocate or locate in County Kerry and be confident they would be able to access postal services when working from home. E-commerce businesses depend on postal services and we should not deprive budding start-up businesses of the ability to avail of services. Other ideas such as the green hub mentioned earlier and navigating State forms online would be helpful.	spk_24
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-06-30	dail	33	Industrial Relations (Provisions in Respect of Pension Entitlements of Retired Workers) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_7	"I remember in the run-up to the election last year queueing at a funeral in Abbeydorney and seeing an election poster on the street. One person in front of me turned to the other and said, ""Who thought that our pensions were going to be one of the biggest issues in this election?"". Since then, the issue of workers' rights has never been far away. Whether it is redundancies, overtime, the lack of double time, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, or the Debenhams workers, we have seen how employers seem to hold all the cards. This Bill is a welcome counterweight to the increasingly lopsided balance against workers' rights. I always think of the ordinary print workers in  During and since the years of austerity the drive to shrink the State and to outsource has decimated good employment, especially in towns that were heavily reliant on the public sector, manufacturing and ESB workers etc. The contribution of these workers cannot be taken for granted. Their current working lot is bad enough without being denied their entitlements. As was pointed out by colleagues today and last week, it is simply unfair that workers are obliged to retire at 65 years of age on a jobseeker's rate of €203. This is below the poverty line in a State with the second highest cost of living in Europe, where food and utility bills are high and where in rural areas, the cost of maintaining, keeping and paying for a car is driving people further into poverty. Contrast that with the pensions of some recently retired Fine Gael members who left this House before the age of 50. Did the parties that formed the Government not hear the voices of the electorate or the people standing in line at the funeral in Abbeydorney who said loud and clear that this is not acceptable? Retirement should be a time to relax with grandchildren in economic comfort as a reward for working for many years, which allows you to contribute in other ways to the economic and social life of our towns and villages. This Bill goes some way to restoring that ideal and this motion should pass today. There should be no delay and we should move to Committee Stage as soon as possible. "	spk_25
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-06-30	dail	33	Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021: Second Stage	dbsect_20	The intent of this Bill, which thankfully is time-limited, is welcome, not just for addressing a legal lacuna that was pointed out by An Garda Síochána but in giving certainty to the hospitality sector. Certainly, over the past few weeks, there has been much confusion, particularly in Killarney, as to what was contained in the town by-laws, which included a 100 m rule, as against the new regulations. Unfortunately, certainty has been in precious short supply and many of the other farcical decisions made by the Government have caused a great deal of damage, division and misunderstanding. It was bad enough when it became clear that the unvaccinated would be asked to work serving the vaccinated, as many hospitality and retail workers will not be offered the vaccine in time. Some of these young people, having worked in a restaurant all night, will not be able to join their vaccinated colleagues for a drink at the end of the night. Now it seems, under section 3(10)(d) of this Bill, that a young person who is covering a lunch break for an hour or two and who fails to produce the authorisation demanded by An Garda Síochána, could be arrested without warrant and possibly could face up to six months in jail. That is something workers will have to take into consideration with their employer. For nearly 18 months, young people have not been able to attend college, socialise, play outdoor sport or attend a match. In some cases, when they tried to socialise outdoors, they were met with members of An Garda Síochána's public order unit. After all of this, the message to them is that if they do not have the vaccine, they cannot socialise indoors but they must work indoors unvaccinated. Given that young people are more likely to occupy less senior roles and do low-paid work in pubs, and are less likely to own or manage those pubs, they are at risk of arrest, as defined in the Bill. While I support the vaccination programme, we are not going to get to sufficient immunity cover and the uptake we need through the creation of a two-tier categorisation of persons. However, given the record of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in this regard, perhaps we should not be surprised. We agreed to the Bill being waived through pre-legislative scrutiny but, once again, the Government is being caught flat-footed by very foreseeable developments, this time in regard to the fears around the Delta variant. The need for this legislation has a solid legal basis but, as we have heard from expert witnesses at the justice committee over the past year, the Government has often blurred the lines, whether deliberately or accidentally, between what are legal obligations and what is health advice. A Private Members' motion my colleagues and I moved would have gone some way towards addressing this by requiring the Government to bring regulations under the relevant legislation before the House for scrutiny prior to their being enacted. The problem goes beyond the confines of parliamentary scrutiny. We have had answers given during press conferences not appearing in Government advice, omissions from Government advice and poor promotion of what restrictions are currently in effect or the rationale for them. All of this continues to be a problem. We saw that today with the announcement regarding the numbers to be allowed to attend matches. This provision has been brought forward from midnight on Sunday to Saturday morning and should, in my view, be brought forward further to facilitate League of Ireland games, which take place on Friday nights, having an expanded number of fans in attendance. Surely the Government has some idea about the spread of the virus from what has been going on at matches around Europe over the past six months? We have been calling for changes in this regard, given that the matches take place outdoors. The UK has seen 50% capacity at games. In Denmark, 11,000 people have been allowed to attend matches. Why is NPHET not releasing the data on outdoor sports fixtures if it needs to justify the small numbers being allowed to attend matches in this State? There are other aspects of the Bill that are concerning. The expansion of the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, for instance, could have been fleshed out a little more. Overall, however, the intent of the Bill is good and it will help to address the legal lacuna identified by An Garda Síochána. We will deal with that at a later stage.	spk_250

The Tús scheme in south Kerry is running at about 55% capacity. The Department of Social Protection is not activating it and it needs to. The rural social scheme will be in sharp decline due to the six-year rule, which needs to be abolished because the scheme is vital for rural farmers and communities. More than 10% of participants in it need to be over 62. That rule needs to be changed because sending people back on a jobseeker's payment from 62 to 68 is not acceptable. The rates of pay need to be increased to reflect the cost of living and increased transport costs. The 2008 Labour Court ruling on pension and gratuity schemes needs to be changed. It is not too late to do something for those people who gave so many years to the community. The benefit to the community needs to be reviewed, recognised and appreciated, rather than underfunded.	spk_159
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-06-23	dail	33	Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998: Motion	dbsect_17	It is heartening to see that in one of the reports that was laid before the House that the Minister accepts that some of these emergency provisions are a departure from normal practice. Many of the human rights leaders to whom we spoke recently accept that emergency provisions which are outside the norm tend to persist the longer they exist and if they are not used, they should cease. The annual renewal is not satisfactory, but rather than putting more appropriate legal architecture in place, successive Governments have sometimes used the renewal as a political football. It is 20 years since a review under the late, great Mr. Justice Hederman, and a review is welcome now. The second issue is the lack of oversight. There is no doubt that there are cases going to the Special Criminal Court at the moment that should not go there. It is simply not right that, as was said recently, a civil servant should have the power to refer cases to the court without reason, challenge or explanation. We called for a review last year, as we believe the legislation is outdated and belongs to another era. The review group has been appointed and it has some excellent members. We will await its report. We will deliver our own submission and we hope voting on this motion will soon be redundant. In the meantime, we await the outcome of the review group and we will keep the matter under review.	spk_249
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-06-16	dail	33	Acquisition of Development Land (Assessment of Compensation) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_8	"This Bill is welcome for a number of reasons. I commend Labour on introducing it. The need for a more equitable and rounded view of land, the purchase of land and policy relating to land has been urgent for decades. I noticed it in particular last night when canvassing on behalf of Senator Lynn Boylan around the Irishtown and Ringsend area, where, time after time, it came up on the doorsteps that people cannot afford the €500,000 needed to purchase houses for themselves or their families to keep them close to their loved ones in the area. There is no social or affordable housing being built in the area to any significant extent. It is not only in Irishtown and Ringsend, it is the whole country. In Tralee, after the economic crash and particularly under the Government that came to power in 2011, the waiting time relating to the town council's housing list increased from approximately seven years initially to 14 years in 2020. That was as a direct result of Government policy which led to the building of affordable and social housing being halted. The list expanded unbelievably. There were plenty of schemes, such as the housing assistance payment, HAP, leasing, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, etc. The abolition of the town council in Tralee by the Labour-Fine Gael Government also made things more difficult. Community cohesion was affected because houses that had been constructed during the boom became investment properties and were rented out. The good council policy of integrating estates was thrown to one side when investors threw Tom, Dick and Harry into the houses without any vetting, something that led to disputes and difficulties with unsuitable tenants. We continue to suffer the consequences of housing policy over decades but, particularly, that adopted over the past ten years. Housing policy has resulted in rising house prices, no social and affordable housing and vulture funds running amok. Another reason Sinn Féin supports the Bill is that it is a response to ever-increasing constitutional rigidity within Government policy. Previous speakers referred to matters being unconstitutional. Now, the Government has given the excuse that we must wait for the Law Reform Commission's reports. That is ridiculous. The constitutional provisions relating to property are also causing problems. This rigidity is, of course, performative and insincere in many instances, but is particularly marked by Fine Gael Ministers professing all too often that their hands are tied legally. The courts understand that the Legislature has the right to legislate for the benefit of the common good. Housing is one of the most important services we, as a society, provide. The response ""We would need a referendum for that"" is not good enough. Of course, that prompts the question of how the Government's case and record would stand up in the face of such a referendum. Another reason the Bill is welcome is the failure of successive Governments' policies on housing, particularly as the fundamentals of land and land pricing have never been addressed. The serviced sites fund is one example in this regard. That fund is supposed to support local authorities in the provision of key enabling infrastructure on their land and to prepare sites for the delivery of affordable housing. In the estates of Cahermoneen, Westcourt, Ard na Lí - all good estates close to the centre of my town - local people were allowed to buy sites that were serviced. This kept the community together and, importantly, provided assistance to small and medium builders and tradespeople to stay working and boosted the local economy. Despite being open for four years, the serviced sites fund has delivered zero homes in Kerry and has not delivered homes that are affordable in other parts of the State either. Serviced sites works so well but the fund is practically dormant. It could be used unlock solutions and possibilities in towns and villages throughout the county."	spk_26
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-05-26	dail	33	Independent Beef Regulator: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_7	I thank Deputy Nolan and the Rural Independent Group for moving the motion. The importance of the agrifood industry to our economy cannot be overstated. Previous speakers have said that the beef sector supports more than 70,000 beef farmers. There are approximately 3,000 in County Kerry alone. The sector supports 10,000 jobs across processing, distribution and transport and is worth €2.5 billion. Most important, the money is spent locally. It is spent on the local concrete men when buying drainage. All the local suppliers benefit from the farmers. Farmers are under pressure at the moment with the price of diesel and the results-based environment agri pilot project, REAP, scheme. The programme has been praised as working well but farmers have great concerns about it. Beef farmers do all the work here but they are the least fairly paid arising out of it. I echo the call of my colleague, Deputy Carthy, other Sinn Féin speakers and others for a properly independent regulator for this sector. A fair price would do much to help small farmers plan yearly income and outgoings rather than being left at the mercy of fluctuation in prices. Intervention in markets is necessary to ensure they function properly. Farmers in County Kerry and elsewhere have been subject to unfair conditions for far too long. The beef regulator must be empowered to make the rules and penalties and enforce them. It must be able to carry out audits in meat factories and retailers. However, the evidence of what has taken place during the Covid-19 pandemic does not fill me with hope. I wish to comment on the Mercosur beef deal. Beef sold into the European Union must be produced under the same standards, regulations and controls as those imposed on producers in Ireland. I heard the Minister say the negative impact must be minimised. That is only stating the obvious. The time is right now for an upper limit to be imposed. Beef producers have been penalised for years by opaque fixing prices. I echo the comments made in respect of the four-movement rule. I was speaking to a farmer in Ballymacelligott in recent days who said the four-movement rule and the 30-day rule are nonsensical and must be abolished.	spk_40
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-05-26	dail	33	Health and Criminal Justice (Covid-19) (Amendment) Bill 2021 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_13	"While this Bill is important, just as important is the debate that surrounds it. We have been consistent in backing the public health guidelines while calling for proper measures on quarantine, track and trace and vaccine roll-out but we also believe the restrictions must be proportionate. It is these fundamentals that the Government needs to get right and I believe there have been many failings in doing so. On looking at the Preamble, everyone accepts that ""a public emergency has arisen"" and as for ""extraordinary measures"", Deputy Martin Kenny has noted that 14,000 people have been fined for leaving their homes. The debate, however, turns to liberty being fundamental in any republic. At times, citizens have had to resort to the High Court to test the proportionality as to whether some of the restrictions have been fair. The Preamble goes on to state ""the trajectory of that disease continues to be precarious"", and while the number of cases was 1,200 in October, down to 162 in December and back up to 8,000 in January, they have reduced a great deal since then. There is a balancing act between the rights of citizens to life and bodily integrity and those of liberty. It is true what the previous speakers have said about the sacrifices that have been made by all citizens in this country. I refer to sacrifices in education and in employment but also sacrifices that have resulted in an increase in domestic violence and an increase in drug taking. We have come to a point where in my constituency of Kerry, there have been only two or three cases in hospitals over the past five weeks. People cannot attend matches. People cannot go for a 5 km run for a charity event. The work on the greenways in Kerry more or less stopped because of the restrictions. The county clean-up day was ceased because, according to the local authority, if there were half a dozen people on a country road on a Sunday morning, that was an organised event and it could not take place. It was ridiculous. There is another aspect in which the Government has failed, namely, in the establishment of clear guidelines grounded in law and in medical evidence in which the public can have faith. The Government asked the Dáil to debate changes to the Health Act which enabled a statutory instrument which would have compelled the businesses to keep receipts but then backed away from that. They allowed for ambiguities to be built up between public health guidelines and what was a matter of criminal law. Legal sanctions were used inappropriately, even against the advice of Dr. Holohan, who warned of certain activities being driven underground. Most importantly, the Government has consistently not communicated the risks of indoor versus outdoor activity. I refer to the recent fiasco over the Clare-Wexford game. Fifteen months on, has anybody looked at the evidence of transmission in outdoor sports? Has anyone analysed the data or are there any data to say that two players who marked two other players on a pitch which is 150 yd long could possibly be a close contact? It cannot be the case. I am worried that this completely risk-averse type of call could make prisoners of us all. The Government will have to make a call and not hide behind advice without testing it to the hilt given the sacrifices that I have already mentioned that have taken place. Otherwise it is bad news for the workers in aviation who are standing outside the conference centre today, who have argued for the antigen testing that is acceptable in 15 other countries. Football matches still cannot continue and as we look across to the Six Counties and across the water, we see the opening of outdoor activities there. I have been involved in park runs for the past few years. It is a brilliant voluntary community-led activity that 12,000 participate in weekly. It is still off the table. Eighty thousand people undertake 650,000 runs or walks. As for the participants, 7% have a disability, 17% are from the lowest socioeconomic percentile and 50% are women, all groups that have been heavily impacted by Covid-19 restrictions. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, for having met organisers this morning to consider a trial run. While elite sports have their advocates, unfortunately, runs and social events such as Park Run do not have that kind of slick PR machine behind them. There is no reason that I can see why those events cannot take place as soon as possible. Otherwise there is no benefit to the vaccine roll-out."	spk_161
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-05-25	dail	33	Annexation of Palestine: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_9	Over the past fortnight, 213 people, including 61 children, have been killed in Gaza. The number of Palestinians wounded stands at 1,400, with tens of thousands being displaced from their homes, according to the United Nations. Rallies were held all over Ireland, including two in County Kerry; one was in Killarney and the other in my home town of Tralee, which is twinned with Beit Sahour in the West Bank. We sent a strong message of solidarity to them. The other rally I was at in the last fortnight was up in Gortaglanna in the north of the county, where four men were lined up and shot by the Black and Tans 100 years ago this week. One survived and was able to counter the narrative that there was a battle and that the Black and Tans had shot the three men in self-defence. With this motion we are countering the narrative that the State of Israel is acting in self-defence, the narrative that there were clashes between Palestinians and Israel, that the attacks by Israel were attacks on Hamas or that it is acceptable to bomb a building and kill 20 children because someone from Hamas is suspected to be present. We in this county also know of gerrymandering, false majorities and about discrimination. Israel continues to refer to the Palestinians as a minority even though they are in the majority between the Jordan river and the Mediterranean. Israel maintains a veneer of democracy, even though many Palestinians are disenfranchised. The real story is that 750,000 Palestinians were removed from their homes in the 1940s. They were moved to refugee camps and according to Israel, those refugees have no connection to this land. The truth is that Jerusalem was illegally annexed in 1967 and the annexations continue to this day. The UN resolutions state that any actions to alter the status of Jerusalem are illegal. The story is that Israel continues to allow settlements to be constructed, contrary to international law. We know about the Jewish nation state law, enshrining Jewish superiority and further eroding the status of Palestinians, downgrading their language and promoting Jewish settlement. The truth is that attacks that kill 20 children are not self-defence under any recognised definition. The truth is that the international community, especially the USA and the UK, has let Israel away with it. I heard the Minister saying we will do all we can but I do not believe we are doing that. Israel is acting with impunity. Palestinians have little power. Bob Dylan was mentioned. We are standing in the doorway and we are blocking up the hall rather than doing anything about this properly. We must formally recognise the state of Palestine, implement the occupied territories Bill and demand the right of return. We are on the UN Security Council so we need implement resolutions. We need to send a strong message now. To quote Ian Brown from the Stone Roses:How many mothers to cry?How many sons have to die?How many missions left to fly over Palestine?‘Cause as a matter of factsIt's a pact, it's an actThese are illegal attacks.	spk_165
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-05-19	dail	33	Ceisteanna ar Reachtaíocht a Gealladh - Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_11	I am sure the Taoiseach is aware of the crisis in the public provision of dental healthcare. Many people from all over Kerry have contacted my office. They cannot even get an appointment to be seen, never mind receive dental treatment. The treatment service scheme is not fit for purpose. It has not been amended or improved for ten years. It is uneconomic for dentists to participate in the scheme and dentists actually lose money if they take on new medical card patients. People have contacted me to say dentists receive only €33 for a basic examination, which includes X-rays. For dentures, by the time dentists pay dental technicians, they receive only €20 per hour. It is not feasible to run a practice on that. Dentists feel ignored by the Department - they did not receive personal protective equipment, PPE, or grants and do not get a pension. There is an excellent new facility in Tralee but it needs more staff and more dentists. The public dental facility must also be restored to Listowel and north Kerry. It is a basic healthcare need. People's rights are being denied. No wonder members of our diaspora are reluctant to return when they see this is the service they will get.	spk_171
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-05-19	dail	33	Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_17	There is little doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed some of the issues regarding how we take care of the weaker in society, in particular the elderly. At one stage, much was made of the differing death rates between Ireland and the UK, where the use of nursing homes is more widespread, and places like Spain and Italy, where it is more common for multiple generations of the same family to reside together. Needless to say, the comparison eventually fell foul of the rising case numbers, and while heroic efforts were made by staff and others to keep the virus out of nursing homes, many eventually succumbed to the awful reality of the virus. I understand that half of the deaths occurred in nursing homes. The Oaklands Nursing Home in Listowel made national headlines during the second wave when the virus found its way in from the community. HIQA previously expressed concerns in the lead-up to the outbreak. I believe what happened in Oaklands and in other nursing homes must be part of a public inquiry into the State's response to Covid-19. While there is a place for good, private operators, the outsourcing of elder care to private operators has caused problems. The HSE should have more of a role. When problems emerged in private nursing homes they called on the HSE for assistance. I pay tribute to all healthcare workers, but especially to the ones in the Cork-Kerry community healthcare area, who rolled up their sleeves, went into places and sorted out the problem, putting their own lives at risk. I would also like to see a review of how elder care is provided generally across the country, including a review of HIQA. It is clear that there is significant demand from families to get their loved ones into a HSE-run nursing home in County Kerry, in particular in north Kerry, where there is no HSE-operated home. I reiterate my call for the HSE to commit to the provision of a new community nursing home in north Kerry. We also need to change radically how we provide and fund these facilities. A public model is easier to regulate and, when we consider that 80% of all residents in private homes avail of the fair deal scheme, we are effectively operating a publicly funded model already. People requiring elder care are some of our most vulnerable and they deserve better.	spk_239
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-05-18	dail	33	Ballymurphy Inquest: Statements	dbsect_11	I spoke to a woman from Belfast a few weeks ago about Ballymurphy. She told me that her mother always said that her brother went out that day and came home a totally different person and was lost to the family. He reacted to the state-sponsored violence and the subsequent cover-up of what happened at Ballymurphy and on Bloody Sunday a few months later in the only way he could, which was by taking up arms. I was staggered over the past month or so by how few people to whom I spoke had heard about Ballymurphy. There are a number of reasons for that. Going back to section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, the political programming that was offered by journalists in this State led to a narrative that ultimately served no purpose at all. The people who went further than what was required in the Broadcasting Act silenced campaigners who were campaigning against injustice. Those campaigners were labelled as fellow travellers. The Special Branch followed them around, they were harassed and they lost their jobs. Even people from my party who were trade union representatives were not allowed to speak on television on behalf of their trade union. People think cancel culture is something that has only been happening recently. In fact, anyone who was supportive of people like the Birmingham Six and the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and Ballymurphy was, in effect, cancelled back in the 1970s and 1980s, whereas the leaders of the campaign to silence became establishment figures, columnists and programme controllers. If they are to be believed, they became Government advisers. Fortunately, truth and justice have now been obtained by the families of the Birmingham Six and the victims of Bloody Sunday and Ballymurphy, but the other campaigns go on. The political coverage and whitewash that happened around that time and in the years leading up to Ballymurphy saw lies being told about weapons being stored in Catholic churches, making both the church and its lay and clerical members legitimate targets in the eyes of loyalists and the British army. Even to this day, journalists and newspaper executives are assumed to hold political views and affiliations based on where on the island they come from. We have seen recently that this continues. Campaigners and documentarians who sought to establish the truth were harassed viciously. It is hard to imagine that political advice was sought until recently from some of the people who engaged in this nonsense but apparently that is the case. Many media outlets may not admit it but there was a whitewash in the British legal system and there was a whitewash of silence in Ireland over Ballymurphy, Bloody Sunday and many others. Issues with inquests in the British state are not confined solely to the Six Counties, as a recent report by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, on the 26-county system demonstrates. The report documents the heartbreaking incidents where families have had to wait many years to find out what happened to their loved ones. What was done to the Ballymurphy families through malfeasance and contempt is being done to others through neglect bordering on contempt. This must be urgently addressed and the findings of the ICCL report must be implemented.	spk_260

We have seen the result of climate change in every county and, globally, in the displacement of millions of people from the southern hemisphere. My county of Kerry has been affected by numerous weather events in recent years, including flooding. The Ring of Kerry has seen bad flooding on high mountain passes and White Strand beach in Cahersiveen was under water in February this year. Kenmare has had a number of very bad flooding incidents in the past number of years. In the north of the county, west of Tralee, Ballyroe, Barrow and Ardfert have been hit, along with Fossa, Faha and Caher. More and more extreme weather events will continue to affect the county, which could be said both to suffer and benefit from a high degree of peripherality and its proximity to the Atlantic and other waterways and lakes. Reference was made in the House this week and last to the fire in Killarney National Park. An issue that has not been mentioned is the response rate. We need a committee in place that can respond as quickly as possible when there is a severe weather alert for anywhere in the country. The 48 hours or so it took to get a second helicopter down to Killarney was not acceptable. Another factor is that the rhododendron problem has not been dealt with for years. Now is the time to address that issue once and for all. A 15-year plan should be put in place to eliminate rhododendron from the national park and beyond, over the Caha Pass into County Cork. Unless we take action, ordinary communities are going to suffer. Everyone must play their part and be seen to do so.This Bill does not rule out measures such as a carbon tax, which we oppose, and which does little to tackle the big polluters. Kerry is a coastal county so industries such as fishing and tourism will be displaced first, and individual and unequal measures will fuel scepticism and resistance around climate change. Fairness and social justice must be the priority and the most vulnerable must not bear the cost with additional charges on their solid fuel. Anyone who canvasses in poorer areas will see the reliance there and poorer people should not be punished more than anybody else or disproportionately. Clear targets must be put in place. The recent results-based environment-agri pilot project, REAP, for example, could be more ambitious and the farmers are willing to engage in schemes such as the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, but more engagement is necessary and unfortunately the scheme that is in place has been criticised by farmers' organisations. The Government must work with them. There needs to be more ambition in the Bill as aspirations without the backing to achieve them lead to unnecessary conflict. As has been stated, the Shannon LNG terminal is not mentioned in the Bill but a political football has been building up around it. We cannot ignore climate change’s impact on the environment and biodiversity more generally in County Kerry. I was a little confused to hear the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on national radio last week speaking about the planting of forestry along waterways and contributing to water quality. A wise man recently told me that there was a type of fish, the cabhlach dubh, the sea trout, which is white when it comes in from the sea but used to make its way as far as the parish of Brosna, which is nearly in County Limerick, and up at Carroll’s Cross. That has been decimated by over-forestation. There is a difference between a plantation and forestry. We must have more emphasis on forestry and not on plantations. We also see the worldwide effect of climate change and there will continue to be mass movement of people as much of the world becomes uninhabitable. I look forward to the rest of the debate and hearing the contributions of the other speakers.	spk_224

There was no tax incentives for them, but tax incentives for the builders who were allowed to loosen the construction standards and allow for co-living arrangements, and the colleges by and large were allowed to outsource accommodation. This Bill is why we are in Leinster House and in the convention centre today. It is help for accommodation during academic term times. It is to help with one month's notice and to refund relevant payments. This is the type of legislation that we should all be associated with. So much for ""We are all in this together"".

Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-04-28	dail	33	Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage	dbsect_30	The purpose of this Bill is to rectify any constitutional infirmities in legislation identified by the Supreme Court in the case of Wayne Ellis. In its judgment in May 2019, the Supreme Court found that the Oireachtas could impose mandatory penalties but only if applied to all persons.It is not constitutionally permissible for the Oireachtas to specify a mandatory penalty which only applies to a limited class of persons, such as a person who had previously committed one or more listed offences. The Supreme Court held that the application of a penalty in such cases is the administration of justice and, under Article 34 of the Constitution, may only be administered by the courts. The Bill is intended to remedy this fault. It is easy to come into this Chamber and appear to be hard on crime and propose mandatory minimum sentences but we must consider the balance of powers and the constitutional requirements. This Bill is welcome in what it sets out to do, namely, to abolish certain mandatory minimum sentences, some which have been on the statute books for more than a century. According to  Today, we heard demands for longer sentences to be passed in respect of the events in Killarney over the weekend without any evidence that what happened was actually caused by a criminal act. People must understand that it is very important to address the underlying issues because while it is easy to be seen to be tough on crime, it is much harder to come up with solutions and investment in education, particularly in inner city communities. It is harder to find more park rangers and to put in place a proper system and a crisis management plan for Killarney National Park, for example. Going back to the Ellis case, the Supreme Court ruled that the Oireachtas does have a role but it is worth reflecting on whether we should assume this role with respect to mandatory minimum sentences. The Law Reform Commission recommended no new mandatory minimum sentences be introduced onto the Statute Book. Most of the time, when there are calls for mandatory minimum sentences, it is more to do with publicity for the Member in charge, rather than any real understanding of the law. The position of the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, is that we should look towards the repeal of others, but we must grasp the hard questions. In respect of many of the other mandatory sentences on the books, it may not be politically palatable to tackle them, but this should not stop us. Crime is changing and the pandemic is accelerating this change. The number of petty offences is down all over the country but more serious offences are increasing and there is a shift towards more serious organised crime. It reflects the economics of crime for the criminal gangs as in-person opportunities to make money decline. We should do everything we can to prevent their increased power and sophistication.	spk_320
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-04-22	dail	33	Direct Provision: Statements	dbsect_2	Is cuimhin liom, tuairim is deich mbliana ó shin, go raibh beirt fhear agus bhí cónaí orthu in ionad soláthair dhírigh i dTrá Lí. In my club, the Tralee Dynamos, we had two players who were living in direct provision. One was Samir, from Algeria. I remember talking to him. He was receiving €19 per week. He told us he had obtained work for a weekend. He worked for 19 hours over the course of the weekend and he got less than €100 for his work that weekend, which was around half the minimum wage. Samir was probably one of the most skilful players ever to play in Kerry and that is how he was welcomed. Another player was called Mohamed. One Sunday evening, we had to play a match in Castlemaine. He was late coming back and he was refused his dinner. He complained and we never saw him again because he was transferred to another place. I am hopeful some of the proposals in this White Paper will end some of the problems Samir and Mohamed faced, that there will be own-door accommodation, a right to work and accommodation close to services, since both of their lawyers were in Cork. I hope there will be speedy processing, proper integration and an end to the waste of public money by enriching speculators. This White Paper builds on work done previously, and the issues with international protection and direct provision are clear. We need to face the realities that war, discrimination and climate change will continue to force people to seek international protection in Ireland. Attempting to make it more difficult for them, as the system has done historically, will not change this. We should not continue to exploit and impose further injustice on people who are vulnerable. Regarding accommodation proposals, Sinn Féin feels it is important the State would own and operate the phase 1 reception centre facilities and that there would be a clear and independent system of inspection. We have seen private companies become involved in this type of facility in other jurisdictions, leading to problems. Cutting corners or locating these centres in isolated areas creates the potential for poor conditions and conflict with local communities. Beyond the reception centre phase, there is a move towards own-door accommodation. Forcing residents to share cramped accommodation created a serious public health hazard and an unconscionable situation in Cahersiveen last year. Sinn Féin has long called for a system where approved housing bodies build and maintain accommodation.Sinn Féin supports dignity for all in our housing policy, including those accessing homeless services, those on the social housing list and those in need of affordable housing. The Government must get serious about addressing housing shortages for all, as this will be the best means of providing integration and community cohesion. Beyond that strand, things are a little more uncertain. Strand 2, which offers incentives to convert commercial properties within areas earmarked for urban renewal needs more detail. The for-profit nature of the system has been its biggest Achilles’ heel and has led to private operators cutting corners in inappropriate accommodation around the country. Moving away from poor provision in peripheral areas not serviced will be key and the White Paper does not have as strong an emphasis on this as the Day report. How we get from there seems a little uncertain, and I note that the Irish Refugee Council, IRC, recently emphasised the need to use the legally-binding standards within existing centres to improve things in the interim. We must avoid any limbo that could result from a lack of capital investment, as well as the potential for old providers to get into the new system through the back door. There are concerns in Kerry that properties were being purchased with a view towards doing this and I am seeking and hoping that the Minister will see that new fit-for-purpose accommodation will not be in inappropriate locations. Regarding welfare, education and employment, I commend the White Paper and it makes some good suggestions. The right to work and welfare proposals are also positive, and aligning payments to supplementary welfare allowance and child benefit payments makes sense. However, access to driver licences and proper work permits can, and should be, arranged as soon as possible. Deportation notices being received by those working in the health service was an unedifying part of the pandemic, as I am sure the Minister will agree. However, the Day report’s recommendation to grant five years leave to remain for people within the system more than two years is only under consideration. This might mean that many asylum seekers working in healthcare and food supply will have to worry about deportation, and I would like to hear from him regarding ensuring that he will clear the current backlog. Turning to the speed of any new system, avenues of appeal must be respected and we must adhere to Ireland’s international obligations, while respecting due process.	spk_3
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-04-21	dail	33	Mental Health Surge Capacity: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_2	Gabhaim buíochas don Teachta Mark Ward, Joanna Kelly agus an fhoireann go léir i Sinn Féin. I also thank the public health staff, community and voluntary sector workers and those working in family resource centres whom I have spoken to in the past week. They have spoken of a major increase in demand for services to address issues such as anxiety, drug and alcohol misuse and concerns over sexuality, education, employment, poor self-esteem and behavioural issues. They mentioned the need for extra outreach community-based staff and upstreaming for those under 18 and over 65 years in particular, where services are practically non-existent. Were it not for the work of the Kerry Diocesan Youth Service, which works with some of the most vulnerable young people, and the Southwest Counselling Service, there would be little or no prevention, early diagnosis or counselling. Residential and inpatient services are difficult to secure. Those I spoke to mentioned the need for funding, which is severely lacking and typically insecure or targeted at a specific area and cannot be used to fulfil demand. They mentioned the lack of respite care, poor awareness of resources and the need for a multidisciplinary approach.The announcement by the HSE last night that a review of 1,500 cases in south Kerry alone regarding the possible over-prescribing of medication for young people is deeply troubling. Given that two students in an average class are now seen by or referred to CAMHS, we must have confidence that young people are getting the best medical mental health care possible. Serious questions will arise regarding oversight and how long this was known to the HSE. While we must wait for the review, we must consider did the lack of the services mentioned by the people that I spoke to in the last week such as the lack of auxiliary services, talk therapies, early intervention, social work and the lack of home help lead to a rush to chemical intervention. The motion calls for a public crisis de-escalation team and an ambulance service in every CHO. There was but currently there is no day care centre in the town of Tralee where the chronically ill can call in, and a referral centre is not enough. If someone can attend a primary care centre in a Covid-19-compliant way, why can he or she not attend a day care centre. One needs to open on a 24-hour basis if the Government are serious. While GP referrals decreased, there is a concern about a flood of referrals. I call on the Minister of State to act now and to heed these warnings. How confident can we be that the requirements of those on the front line will be met when the list forwarded for vaccination and sent from psychiatric services to the vaccine roll-out team one month ago remains unanswered?	spk_8
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-03-25	dail	33	Covid-19 Vaccination Programme: Statements	dbsect_2	I am sure many Deputies were contacted by a lecturer in Irish studies in the University of Liverpool during the week. I felt like writing back to him because anyone who wants to understand the inequalities in Irish healthcare would feel the lack of a proper system such as a national health service has been highlighted in the vaccine roll-out. I understand that pandemics highlight inequality. People who are housebound due to ill health have been contacting my office in Tralee as they have not received a vaccine. Their daughters have been contacting us and their GPs. The GPs told them to go to the HSE, and the HSE said to go to the National Ambulance Service. That roll-out has not worked out well for them. If people are aligned to a large GP practice, they are top of the queue, but if they live in a rural area or are attached to a small practice, it has been suggested they buddy up with another practice. That is okay for organising a school tour to Fota Island but it is not good enough for getting a vaccine rolled out in a fair way. GPs feel the system was not managed. There was no system for pairing or buddying up, there was no guidance and there was nobody available to listen to them when they needed it most. Desperate patients contacting us is not good enough. The supply chain has not worked well enough. There is too much confusion, and when there were problems in the supply chain, the flaws in the Government's roll-out were exposed badly. What has the Government learned from the initial stage of the roll-out? What steps have been taken to ensure a smoother roll-out? What steps are being taken to ensure there is communication with patients and members of the public when they go to access the vaccine into the future? The vision of reopening has to be apparent to people. The communication must be there so people can be motivated to keep going with all the restrictions.	spk_15
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-03-11	dail	33	Criminal Procedure Bill 2021: Report and Final Stages	dbsect_11	I concur with the comments of Deputy Martin Kenny on our amendment. Another amendment, in the name of Deputy Pringle, calls for a review of the operation of this Bill within three years of its enactment. The Bill introduces procedures that will facilitate the trial of white-collar criminal cases and anything that will facilitate, strengthen and encourage more cases against white-collar defendants will be welcome. I used to work in the criminal courts and often saw the charges with which some people in court were faced. For example, a person was charged with stealing an apple tart. A homeless man was charged with stealing a packet of ham from Tesco. Others, mostly young fellows, were charged with having in their possession a fraction of a gram of cannabis. All of those people had potential careers destroyed because of a criminal conviction, while other cases involving financial irregularities of up to millions of pounds and euro were never brought to court. It is time for the revelry enjoyed by people with vested interests to come to an end. I congratulate the powerful lobby of the insurance industry on the successful campaign it has waged to convince nearly everybody in the country that the high cost of premiums is due to whiplash cases. No sooner had the judges left their Zoom meeting on Saturday morning than the insurance lobby was out again, stating that premiums will not come down this year. That is unfortunate but not unexpected because we have heard the same thing for the past 30 or 40 years, including when juries were eliminated and senior counsels removed from civil cases and the cost of premiums continued to increase. Even when the number of claims went down by 45% and the cost of claims per policy went down by 9%, premiums over the past ten years rose by 35%. When, in the middle of the pandemic, the number of claims collapsed, everyone in this House and everyone in the country with an insurance policy knows that the refunds they were given amounted to €20 or €30. It is time for leadership, not salesmanship, as someone once famously said, with regard to our attitudes towards these powerful vested interest groups in the insurance industry. We must take them on. Their revelry is over and we should be doing everything we can to facilitate more cases being taken against these powerful lobbies.	spk_210

Tá a lán ceisteanna reatha ag baint leis an teanga. Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le clann Margaret Keane tar éis an bua a bhí acu sna cúirte i Sasana. Rugadh in Éirinn í ach fuair sí bás i Coventry, áit a chaith sí an mórchuid dá saol. Ní raibh cead ag a clann an Gaolainn a scríobh ar a leac uaighe ach bhí bua acu sna cúirte. Bhí a mhuintir ag iarraidh: “Inár gcroíthe go deo” a scríobh ar an leac uaighe. Dhiúltaigh an coiste sin ach bhí an bua acu sa deireadh. Mar a deir an seanfhocal, “Muna n-oireann an caipín duit, ná caith é” nó “Más ar bior, ná casfar tú”, mar tá fadhbanna ag baint leis an nGaeltacht, le pobal na Gaeltachta agus le pobal labhartha na Gaeilge in Éirinn agus tá sin náireach. Tá sé dochreidte nach bhfuil daoine in ann eitilt a cheannach le hAer Lingus bille a íoc le Banc na hÉireann, nó an síneadh fada a úsáid. Tá a fhios againn, ina dhiadh an fógra Dé Luain, nach bhfuil suim dá laghad ag an mbanc sin ina chuid chustaiméirí. Bheadh sé an-éasca dó an fhadhb atá aige leis na billí a íoc a cheartú ach tá éileamh na gcustaiméirí síos an liosta s’acu. Chomh maith leis sin, níl oifigeach Gaeilge i gcuid de na comhairle contae. I gCiarraí, mar shampla, níl oifigeach Gaeilge ann ó mhí na Bealtaine 2020. Níl seirbhísí ar fáil trí Ghaeilge. Tá fáilte roimh chách seachas roimh ár dteanga féin. Mar aon le Teachtaí eile, bím ag plé na leasuithe do Bhille na dteangacha oifigiúla. Níl an Rialtas ag glacadh leis na leasuithe a chur muid síos chun an Ghaeilge a neartú. Tá orainn aitheantas suntasach a bhunú. Ag an bpointe seo, tá sé práinneach. Tá obair na gcapall déanta ag leithéidí Daithí Mac Cárthaigh, Foras na Gaeilge, an Coimisinéir Teanga agus an Foras Pátrúnachta chun lógónna na gcomhlachtaí poiblí a bheith i nGaeilge agus chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus a neartú. Ba chóir go mbeadh tosaíocht don Ghaolainn ar na comharthaí bóithre agus bím ag obair ar sin sa choiste. Creidim go bhfuilim ar aon intinn leis an Aire, an Teachta Catherine Martin agus leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, mar gheall air seo ach ní raibh an Rialtas in ann glacadh leis an leasú sin mar mhaígh Oifig na mBillí go raibh costas ag baint leis. Ní aontaím leis sin. It would be easy to make a change so that into the future, when a public body is erecting any new sign or publishing a notice, the Irish language text should be positioned so that it is likely to be read first ach beimid ar ais go dtí an pointe sin i gCoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus Phobal Labhartha na Gaeilge. Chomh maith leis sin, tá saincheisteanna eile atá tábhachtach do phobal labhartha na Gaeilge ann, go mór mór in iarthar Chiarraí. Tá sé de dhualgas orainn an leathanbhanda a fheabhsú sa Ghaeltacht, spreagadh a thabhairt do dhaoine maireachtáil sa Ghaeltacht agus b’fhéidir múinteoirí sa bhreis a sholáthar chun tacaíocht a thabhairt do mhúineadh na Gaolainne sa Ghaeltacht. I mBaile an Sceilg in Uíbh Ráthach, ba chóir dúinn tacaíocht a thabhairt don Gteic chun fostaíocht a choimeád in earnáil na Gaeilge. Tá an Ghaeilge curtha in áit na leathphingine ach tá seans againn leis an mBille atá á bplé sa roghchoiste béim a chur ar an nGaolainn agus í a choimeád beo.

Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-02-17	dail	33	Covid-19 (Agriculture, Food and the Marine): Statements	dbsect_14	I wish to raise a couple of issues on the processing of applications and appeals by the public, many of which have been languishing for months and years, paralysing farmers and operators in Kerry and grossly affecting their income. Many constituents have contacted me regarding tree felling licence applications. I inquired about the status of one licence in July. I checked again in January and was told that it would probably be another nine months and to check back again in six months' time. This was for an application that was submitted in 2019. Lumber is being imported due to these delays. This is not beneficial to the environment and it is devastating for the operators and the industry here. The appeals process should be there for the people directly affected by the forestry operation, not for blanket objections. Currently, 90% of appeals against Coillte applications go no further but must churn through the system. I ask the Minister to get the multiple divisions of the forestry appeals committee up and running as was promised some months ago. Invitations to apply for aquaculture licences were issued by the Department in 2016. In Castlemaine Harbour, more than 100 applications were received in Cromane, including from many people who had no previous association with the area. The number of applications has apparently led to all of those being rejected due to concerns about the impact of such a large number of growers operating in an area of special conservation and a relatively small spatial area.Only 32 of these applications went to appeal and these have been in limbo for some years. There is no means for these growers to engage with the Department and discuss their applications. The beef environmental efficiency programme is an invaluable programme of grant aid for small farmers. Some Kerry farmers have contacted me, saying they have been denied the aid and have appealed. On further inquiry I have heard that the Department has hundreds of appeals and it will likely take 12 weeks for any appeal to be reviewed. The staff are working in unusual and difficult conditions due to Covid-19, but additional resources or a different system must be investigated so that small farmers are not put out of business.  Some constituents, including farmers and solicitors, have contacted me about the banks' proposal to impose negative interest rates on deposit accounts. In transferring a family farm, in some cases where the farmer has deceased, moneys are being held in solicitors' clients' accounts. They will be further punished by banks which pay very little tax. This is totally inappropriate and pure greed on behalf of the banks, particularly in probate cases where the estate is being divided up. I ask the Minister to have a word with the financial regulator to ensure this will not happen and that families who are waiting on money from their solicitors will not be penalised with further financial penalties. 	spk_180
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-02-11	dail	33	Health (Parliamentary Oversight of Certain Instruments Relating to Covid-19) Bill 2021: First Stage	dbsect_7	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Health Act 1947, and for that purpose to provide for parliamentary oversight of regulations made by the Minister for Health under section 31A of that Act and of orders made by that Minister under section 31B of that Act and to provide for related matters.From the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in May last year, the Government introduced the first regulations to deal with the situation. These have largely been to impose restrictions on society to protect our healthcare service and save lives. Unlike other jurisdictions, we did not declare a state of emergency and we do not have much of the legal architecture required. Using the Health Act was the correct choice and compliance has largely been good. It is unlikely that more legal powers would have changed the situation much as public trust and buy-in is most desirable. Dr. Holohan himself spoke about the dangers of using the law in public health matters, given that it drives breaches underground and may create issues with people being honest with tracking and tracing workers. While we may not have had a harsh legal regime compared with other jurisdictions, the regulations under the Health Act are unprecedented restrictions on people's liberties. It is only right and proper in a republic that Dáil Éireann is given a greater role in debating and scrutinising these restrictions to ensure that they are coherent, fair and logical. This has not always been the case. We remember the regulation that was introduced where receipts would have to be shown for exactly what people ate last summer. When we were debating criminalisation for violations of the regulations, we did not actually know what regulations were potentially going to be in place. The public and An Garda Síochána must be fully informed in advance of the content of the regulations but too often, they have not been. I have spoken to sergeants who have told me that they have received notice of the regulations late the night before they were supposed to introduce them on the streets and that is not acceptable. I believe that this Bill will help with clarity and effective communication of the content of any proposed regulations. The House should not be placed in such a position again. The current Act requires that Parliament passes a motion annulling the regulations which, given that the Government commands a majority and controls the Order Paper, is unfair and burdensome. Under this Bill, regulations issued will be presumed annulled unless both Houses pass a motion affirming them. This would require the Executive to give the Dáil time to scrutinise and affirm any regulations or orders made. Accordingly, the separation of powers between Parliament and the Executive will, hopefully, be properly restored. This Bill reflects the situation that prevails in New Zealand. I thank Dr. David Kenny from Trinity College who gave evidence at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response and recommended such measures. I also thank the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisers for the work and help that it provided in preparing the Bill.	spk_117

Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-02-10	dail	33	Appointment of Member of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority: Motion	dbsect_14	"The Legal Services Regulatory Authority has been carrying out good work since it was established back in 2016. It is modelled on the core values of transparency; accountability; independence; protecting those who avail of legal services; protecting legal practitioners from frivolous complaints; and ensuring that justice is done and seen to be done. It has proven to be innovative, which is also among its core values. In November 2019, for example, it introduced regulations to allow partnerships of solicitors to apply to the LRSA for authorisation to operate as limited liability partnerships. This model of legal service delivery had been called for by people who are involved in legal services for many years and it allows legal practitioners in Ireland to avail of a model which is commonly found elsewhere. The limiting of personal liability by legal practitioners, however, comes with responsibilities. They must communicate effectively with clients and creditors and maintain appropriate professional indemnity insurance. While legal practitioners are heavily regulated, a fair and open complaints system is also necessary and important. I note from one of the reports of the LRSA that in the six months from October 2019 to March 2020, there were 636 complaints. Of the complaints received, in the period to early December, 96 were inadmissible, 23 were withdrawn and a further 50 were resolved informally with the assistance of the authority's staff during what it calls the pre-admissibility stage. The LRSA must be adequately resourced and there seems to be a backlog, which should be cleared. The LRSA's work in reviewing the education and training of legal practitioners, which was mentioned by the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, is also important, and we look forward to seeing that undergo pre-legislative scrutiny in the committee. In any democracy, there must be strong advocates working to ensure that constitutional and statutory rights are respected and enforced. The Legal Services Regulatory Authority helps with this.I refer here to solicitors and barristers who are willing to take on powerful forces, vested interests in government and the media and insurance companies that seem to have far too much influence for my liking in any republic. Article 40 of the Constitution, which relates to fundamental rights, is brilliant in its simplicity. It states: ""All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law."" That is something that has to be enforced at all times because if one is unfairly dismissed, injured at work or accused of an offence, rightly or wrongly, and if one's liberty is at stake, one will need to seek the advice of a solicitor or a barrister. We will not be opposing this motion. I wish Ms Malone all the best in her work with the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, which, I hope, will continue with the work it has been doing."	spk_243
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-02-10	dail	33	Criminal Procedure Bill 2021: Second Stage	dbsect_16	I thank the Minister for her statement. Many of the features of the Bill are good and we will support its passage to Committee Stage. Some trials are becoming increasingly complex and lengthy due to technological advances and legal innovation. An informed, non-frustrated jury is an important part of the justice system. The provision to allow some arguments to take place pre-trial, thereby avoiding the need to have a jury in another room for perhaps a week or two, is welcome. If I am to be a little picky, I remember that when the Criminal Procedure Act was first amended about 20 years ago, the power of judges to review the evidence prior to sending it forward was removed. I thought that was unnecessary at the time. Perhaps that power could be reintroduced. Section 6(6) states that where an accused has not been arraigned, the judge, if he or she considers it appropriate, may direct that the accused be arraigned at the commencement of a pre-trial hearing. If we are serious about the presumption of innocence, that provision should be tightened up a little. In the public interest, the accused should be arraigned at that stage only in exceptional circumstances. We may deal with that issue on Committee Stage.  If the prosecution is to seek a pre-trial hearing, it seems only fair that all disclosures should be provided to the defence before that takes place. Anyone who has worked in the courts will know it is quite common for a notice of additional evidence to be provided on the morning of the trial or the night before. If the prosecution is seeking something like this, all cards should be on the table.  The Bill also provides for hearings on matters such as the availability of witnesses and issues related to discovery. The discovery aspect is especially important due to developments in technology, complex books of evidence, etc. The report on the future of policing envisions better Garda resources in cybercrime. Complex discovery and admissibility matters are well suited to pre-trial hearings.  It is important to maintain a balance between prosecution and defence at all times and the Bill will give a right to request a hearing, amends the existing laws on books of evidence to ensure information is shared and seen and provides an obligation to notify where expert witnesses or evidence are to be used.  The availability of witnesses and their suitability or otherwise to take the stand is also key. We see generally in the community a disturbing and unfortunate trend whereby young people under the age of 18 years are witnesses or the accused in high profile criminal trials, often in quite violent circumstances. While reportage of crime and discussion of crime is another issue, it is often dominated by the who, what and where. Until we reach the issue of the why, we will not be able to explain some of these acts. Often there is a performative ignorance at play with regard to these developments but there has been a neglect of urban centres, including the north inner city of Dublin. Addressing the causes of crime with early interventions, targeted resources and community policing, education, housing, social care and community-led initiatives is important. We do not have a dedicated youth justice agency. Although the transfer of youth justice functions from the former Department of Children and Youth Affairs to the Department of Justice may yet deliver improvements, it carries a risk. That risk is that young adults and children might be treated with the same resources and processes as adults, which would be inappropriate. I have heard from people in the justice system that the situation has been a crisis point, particularly over the last few years, with younger and younger individuals in a greater state of crisis. A stand-alone youth justice agency, properly resourced, is important. It should include professionals from the medical, social work and justice fields. Young adults who are violent and a danger to themselves have no real place to recover when they are arrested by gardaí. Although a new national forensics facility in Portrane is welcome, we lack a dedicated centre for minors, and this might be increasingly necessary. There was a proposal to establish a facility for young people with psychological difficulties in Cork but that was one of the first things to be abandoned when the last crash happened. The Bill before us will be one part of a solution but wider policy and societal issues must also be addressed. The Bill contains a welcome provision to extend legal aid services to cover costs incurred during preliminary trial hearings. Some judges can be difficult about extending legal aid certificates. The legal aid thresholds should be raised because the working poor are sometimes unable to fund and raise a defence. Section 9 gives the power to exclude members of the public from preliminary trial hearings where some specific offences are being tried, including crimes of a sexual nature and where section 20 of the Criminal Justice Act applies. We welcome this provision. We will see what happens on Committee Stage.	spk_253
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-02-03	dail	33	Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020: Motion	dbsect_16	"I was contacted this week by a start-up company after the Revenue Commissioners adjudged that it did not submit strong enough evidence that its turnover had decreased by more than 25% during last year's trading. This is one of the criteria used to determine ""significant negative economic disruption"". While I understand the need for some parameters, the company lost a number of contracts due to Covid-19 and can prove it. This is, unquestionably, significant economic disruption by any measure. Other supports are insufficient to keep this business operating and employing staff. These are people who want to create and sustain jobs, which are sorely needed in Kerry, rather than survive on subsidies. The goal of the EWSS is supposed to be exactly that and the spirit of the scheme needs to take precedence in this type of situation. This will continue to be an issue as we face two long years of disruption and no business will have been left untouched by the pandemic. There have been a number of issues with the EWSS and its predecessor. We must ensure it is fit for purpose. Over the next two years, once the Covid-19 restrictions are lifted and the vaccination programme is completed, life will return to normal but businesses cannot be expected to be completely stagnant in that period. Not only will we lose businesses that contribute employment and revenue to the Exchequer, but we will also strangle new businesses that are so badly needed in the west of Ireland, particularly in Kerry. The long period of disruption will also have a severe impact on the biggest source of jobs in Kerry which is tourism. As the Minister probably knows, over 16,000 Kerry workers are employed in tourism and many of them were shut out of the Covid-19 PUP and TWSS schemes due to seasonality. Last year most of the season was missed, at the loss of €400 million to the economy in Kerry. However, when businesses could open, people flocked to Kerry and businesses thrived for that very short period which proves that they are viable. There is an enormous appetite among people to follow the advice of NPHET and not go abroad but with no certainty about how long the season will be, allowance needs to be made within the EWSS for seasonal businesses.  The Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, was introduced to further support those in the hospitality and tourism sectors but it ignores any business lacking an on-premises customer experience and excludes a number of outdoor and activity-based tour operators, wholesalers and travel agents working remotely. These businesses are struggling to reopen and are facing permanent closure. In that context, I ask the Minister to extend the scheme. The recently announced tourism recovery fund will help some of these operators and while I welcome it, it is months late and should not have been necessary. We seem to have a trend of stressing businesses to the maximum and only then intervening. Extending the EWSS should ensure that it is accessible to those who need it and should offer those who have spent years, if not decades, adjusting their lives around seasonal business some reassurance. Kerry is the county most affected, according to all surveys.  Finally, it is 300 days since the start of the Debenhams picket and once again I pay tribute to Geraldine, Amy, Trish and the many others who have maintained their vigil at the former Tralee store. I understand that Mandate has recently written to the Taoiseach but has yet to receive a reply. I call on the Government to intervene even at this late stage to help the Debenhams workers. If ever proof was needed of the inequity in the system between workers and capital, this is it. I ask the Government to recognise the right to collective bargaining and to implement the recommendations of the Duffy Cahill report as soon as possible. State supports such as the EWSS should not be available to companies that do not recognise the right of workers to organise."	spk_293
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-01-27	dail	33	Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission: Motion	dbsect_12	"Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an rún seo agus ní bheimid ina choinne. I wish the new appointees well. As the Minister of State said, they have considerable skills and experience and I have no doubt that they will be an addition to the board. The importance of the role of any Garda oversight body cannot be overstated, especially in light of recent events such as the death of George Nkencho in Clonee. It is important that public faith in An Garda Síochána is preserved and upheld. Accountability on the part of our police service is a cornerstone of this. The importance of the independence of GSOC cannot be overstated. It must be independent and it must be seen to be independent. The programme for Government contains a welcome commitment in respect of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. That report identifies a number of issues with the current arrangements relating to accountability of An Garda Síochána. Recently, I spoke to a former employee of GSOC who identified problems very similar to those outlined in the report. I want to speak on a number of issues which continue to challenge the efficacy of GSOC and which hamper overall efforts to maintain a good reputation for An Garda Síochána. The report and the person to whom I spoke both raise concerns about a lack of resources, a duplication of roles and responsibility in GSOC and the Garda Inspectorate, the training of investigators - in that only a few investigators are actually accredited - and the powers of GSOC being insufficient to cover the necessary investigative work. All of this means that many investigations are outsourced back to An Garda Síochána through what is known as the gearán system. Of course, these members do their utmost but there will always be issues when they investigate their colleagues. Justice has to be done and it has to be seen to be done. I have heard about low morale among staff and I am told many have left. Even where cases are managed by GSOC, many investigators, former male and female officers with An Garda Síochána and police services abroad, will naturally see things from the perspective of a police officer. Many investigators are trained in Templemore, alongside the gardaí they will be investigating. I note from some media reports that a new office of the ombudsman for police conduct will be established by legislation being drafted by the Department of Justice. I have tabled a parliamentary question asking about this process, which is mentioned in the report, and I look forward to seeing it. Any police oversight body must be independent of the State and the police force and should be answerable to the justice committee. We need a new model, appropriate training and critical care teams. The current model is borrowed from the UK, which is changing its system. There is one recommendation in the commission's report that must be reflected in the forthcoming Bill, which is that the new body must be able to look into historical problems and complaints in An Garda Síochána, including retired investigating officers. The recent High Court declaration in favour of Joanne Hayes and her family, the woman at the centre of what was referred to, mistakenly I believe, as the Kerry babies case, was a stark reminder of the wrongs of the past. Joanne, her family and her lawyers have long maintained that the case should have been known as the ""gardaí in Kerry case"" or the ""Kerry gardaí case"". What people tend to forget is that the tribunal was established to discover how Joanne Hayes was charged with murder. An apology has been given by the State but an apology for what? What is the State apologising for? While the tribunal was allowed to be used as a forum for discussion of social mores in the 1980s, it never explained how four or five different members of the Hayes family, in different rooms of Tralee Garda station at around the same time, came up with practically the exact same statement, including in respect of things that were scientifically impossible. Some of the statements were preposterous and there is no other conclusion but that some of the statements were prepared by members of a police service that lacked accountability in the 1980s. The people in north Kerry supported the Hayes family and knew that the statements could only have been drafted by members of An Garda Síochána and that members of the family were coerced into signing them. This case had an enormous effect on trust in gardaí in Kerry. There was hardly a conviction in a contested jury trial for 15 years afterwards if there was an issue with Garda credibility. As I have said, some of the findings of the tribunal were preposterous and were seen as an attempt by the State to bury the truth, but the truth will out. We cannot afford a repeat of cases like this, particularly in view of the consequences for the administration and trust in justice. The new body, the ombudsman for police conduct, is a step forward. It does not mention the name of An Garda Síochána. The recommendation that the word ""independent"" be included was not followed. If this is a portent that some investigations will continue to be outsourced it is not positive. The training of investigators in Templemore is not appropriate and cannot continue. Other issues that must be addressed in legislation are policy and resourcing. We have a chance now at this crossroads to have a system of police accountability that is the envy of the world and I hope the forthcoming Bill will be the start of building this system."	spk_181
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-01-27	dail	33	Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_13	"On the amendment to which the Minister of State referred, I know that pet theft is very upsetting. It is even more upsetting than regular theft but I am not sure that this is the place to be putting an amendment of this nature. The delay to which it would give rise would cause more trouble that it is worth. It is important to say that in the original 2001 Act, under section 12, the penalty on indictment is imprisonment of up to 14 years for somebody who goes onto someone else's property and steals anything, regardless of whether it is a pet. These stories play out well in the media, and especially on social media. After the most recent meeting of the joint policing committee in Kerry, I asked one of the sergeants how many cases of pet theft there have been in the county. There have been fewer than five - and it is not the higher end of fewer than five - reported pet thefts in Kerry since 1 January 2020. The key consideration when it comes to a matter of this nature is that this House has a responsibility to address crime and the causes of crime, but also the fear of crime. The same garda whom I spoke to informed me that there were more complaints from people going about their business in the county doing legitimate tasks who were wrongly identified as individuals who were possibly stealing pets, and dogs in particular. Gardaí in Kerry were frustrated that this issue was being hyped up and people were afraid that there were some individuals going around the county, and the country in general, stealing dogs, when that is not the case. It is important to put that fact on the record. On the substantive issue, I wish to highlight the delay in transposing this directive. We have been forced into a situation whereby we have been asked to pass this Bill quickly through both Houses. What commencement date does the Minister of State have in mind in respect of this amending legislation. I understand that existing laws, including the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018, largely cover our obligations, but a referral to the European Court of Justice is a serious matter. Some account should be given as to why the delay occurred here, as it did with transposing other obligations relating to money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Deputies, Ministers and officials are only human. Rushed lawmaking could lead to mistakes and an absence of scrutiny. One important matter in this regard relates to how the Bill amends the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018, while retaining the defence for bodies corporate under section 5. The relevant section states ""it shall be a defence for a body corporate against which such proceedings are brought to prove that it took all reasonable steps and exercised all due diligence to avoid the commission of the offence."" With regard to the original group of offences that the Act covers, some of which were intended to transpose the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions into Irish law, offences under this Bill will also be subject to that defence. The OECD has commented, in the context of its own recommendations, that this is not a defence that it envisaged under the convention. On foot of its report, I understand that the Department is of the view that an offence of vicarious corporate liability would violate an assumption of  One aspect of the Bill that is notable and, indeed, welcome in facilitating prosecutions is that it will allow for extraterritoriality in the prosecution of offences, including situations in which an offence takes place abroad and the proceeds of that offence are laundered in this State. Our laws, having long been criticised by the OECD, have become far more robust since the passing of the 2018 Act. This is particularly important because of the amount of foreign direct investment into this country. We must not let Ireland be perceived as a soft touch when it comes to corporate wrongdoing or exceptionalism. We should not drag our feet in respect of this Bill. We will support its passage. We should have a strong enforcement system, but law is only one part of the system. I believe there is another Bill undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny to overhaul the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, which is also worthy. The powers for the ODCE or the offences created under this Bill are of no use without the resources. The State needs to give itself a fighting chance and create a career path for people who are interested in law and accountancy to work in these matters. The offences under discussion are complex and multilayered and require much know-how. Furthermore, in the area of white-collar crime, private practice will always enjoy an advantage over the prosecution in light of the rewards for those qualified individuals. Various investigations in the past have been delayed and stymied by a lack of resources in the ODCE. Some household names were involved in cases where serious wrongdoing occurred and public confidence in our wider legal and economic system rests on successful sanctioning where wrongs have occurred. That said, Sinn Féin will support the Bill proceeding to Committee Stage. I look forward to engaging with the Minister of State on it in the future."	spk_192
Pa Daly	41	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2021-01-21	dail	33	Covid-19 Vaccination Programme: Statements	dbsect_2	A statement. In order for the vaccine roll-out to succeed - we all want it to succeed - it needs a plan to deliver buy-in and trust from participants. Buy-in should be very high. The Covid-19 vaccine is likely to be the most desired vaccine the world has seen in decades. The plan should set out goals and timelines and performance indicators and all of this will build trust. If the plan is good, it will work. Unfortunately, the last couple of weeks have shaken the implicit trust that many people had. Educators and teaching staff, early years, special needs assistants, SNAs, special education teachers, all teachers, facilities and office staff want to be sure that they and their students are safe in the workplace. They have worked exceptionally hard since June to plan for reopening with very little direction from the Department with minimal resources. The rate of spread in schools has been well-contained for the most part, thanks to staff. However, the new virus strains have completely changed circumstances for them. We are not dealing with the same situation we had from August to December. Not only are teaching staff wary of the Department of Education's reopening plan, they have been largely abandoned in the vaccine plan. The mantra that schools are safe is not good enough. It is the educators in the State that the Minister is talking to. The Minister is not trying to sell the monorail to residents of Springfield.Teachers are ranked priority 11 out of 15. This defies all logic. I have been informed by healthcare workers that they are a broad category in the plan. While many in hospital settings have now received a vaccine, numerous others have been brushed aside. Home helps who go into the homes of elderly and vulnerable people and have close patient contact should be in priority 2. However, I am hearing from home help workers, who have not even been contacted about receiving the vaccine, that they are gravely concerned and need clarity. Dentists are in close contact with their patients and are exposed. We were assured they were in priority 2. Dentists in Kerry, however, have told me that they cannot even get clarification on when they will be contacted to arrange for the vaccine. I was also contacted by an adult day care worker in Kerry who told me his appointment for the vaccine was cancelled due to IT difficulties. When he complained, he was offered the vaccine in Cork city, two hours away. More chaos. Every plan must have contingency. While I appreciate the vaccine is new and the methods of distribution present new challenges, this should have been accounted for. Surely the most basic plan would have stated leftover vaccines must be used for priority 2 workers. It is incredible that the communication of the plan was so poor and rushed. However, it is not surprising. This should have been addressed but like every other plan it was amended after pressure from the Opposition parties. I have heard from teachers and special needs assistants who are terrified to re-enter schools. They care for their students but are being left to balance at-home students with in-person students without additional resources and no commitment to test for close contacts for them. In fact, there has been no additional consideration or resources for this cohort despite evidence of the new virus strains affecting younger people at a far greater rate. Once the trust is broken, it is difficult to repair. Clarity must be provided and the rationale must be clear to all. I urge the Minister to ensure that the priorities fit with public health guidance, as well as investing the right effort and energy. The Government knew what had to be done in ICU but did not take action. The Government knew what had to be done regarding test and trace but that did not happen. It needed to tighten airports and borders but it did not. The Government needs to address the concerns of teachers straight away.	spk_52
Pa Daly	40	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2020-12-16	dail	33	Planning and Development Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_23	"I echo many of the concerns of my colleague, Deputy Ó Broin, about the legislation. As he said, we are not opposing the legislation but we ask the Minister to consider some of the amendments because of the rushed nature of this process and the absence of scrutiny by the housing committee. It is most important to consider the Deputy's amendment to delete what the local authority might consider ""appropriate"" and to ensure effective public participation. As with many issues in planning, the question of trust is most important. If people are opposing wind farms or large developments in their area, for example, but do not feel they are being heard, the system could fall apart. I support online public meetings but we must rethink this in the context of a post-Covid world. The permanent nature of what is being introduced is wrong. Many people find the process opaque at the best of times but if there is provision for the process continuing at the discretion of local authorities, it would be a step backwards. I am thinking in particular of east Kerry from Barr Dubh outside Killarney up through Cordal and into north Kerry. Everybody in that area should be able to participate fully in a process. People feel that when appeals go in, the process is not clear enough. From the initial hearing of a proposal, there must be full trust and confidence in what is going on."	spk_282

Pa Daly	40	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2020-11-18	dail	33	Community Safety and Preventing Crime: Statements	dbsect_22	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire agus an Aire Stáit. I agree with the Minister 100% that the responsibility of An Garda Síochána is to keep people safe, eliminate crime and eliminate the fear of crime. It is a responsibility of everybody in this House not to exaggerate sometimes low crime figures in an effort to get headlines. In regard to eliminating the fear of crime, the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, spoke about the Garda's text alert scheme. Councillor Tom Barry in Listowel has done amazing work in gathering information and seeking to extend to the town the See Something, Say Something text initiative that was piloted in Tralee. The gardaí in Kerry are very keen on the text system but there seems to be a reluctance in Garda headquarters to pay the small amount - I understand it is only €2,000 - needed to expand the scheme and make people feel safer. The crime figures for the second quarter of the year that were released at the end of September included some very interesting statistics which, no doubt, reflect the overall reduction in the crime statistics as a result of the Covid-19 restrictions and the new policing environment. As with employment, business and economics, the pandemic may have had the effect of increasing the pace of some changes in the area of crime that were already happening and deepening some inequalities along the way. The first statistic I want to highlight relates to domestic violence. If we break the broader numbers down by gender, a trend can be seen in the 9% reduction in the number of crimes committed where women were the victim compared with the 26% reduction where the victim was a man. This suggests that there has been an increase in the incidence of domestic violence. The need for a separate family law court and trained family law judges has become more urgent than ever. The second statistic I noted was that relating to online fraud. The take-up of online retail is increasing at the insistence and encouragement of the Government. This may make sense to an extent during the pandemic but it disadvantages traditional retailers and the customers who rely upon them. It also creates fertile ground for fraudsters, with older and less tech-savvy people being caught more easily by scams. The statistics for the second quarter bear this out, with fraud, up 7%, being one of very few categories across the board to show an increase. Assuming, as is reasonable, that real-world, in-person fraud has decreased, there is very likely a significant increase in online fraud. Online retail is not the easy solution the Government sometimes makes it out to be. Many elderly and vulnerable people are, rightly, more trusting of their local retailer, who cannot open at present. The third issue I wish to highlight is that of the statistics relating to drugs and weapons offences. The seizure that took place yesterday in Mountjoy Prison is to be commended, as well as the restrictions which enabled that operation. An ever more restrictive policing environment is enabling increasing detection across the board but it is critical that we do not lose sight of the holistic functions of the criminal justice system. An increasing emphasis on security in our society will not lead to less addiction or poverty. If anything, it is likely to lead to the opposite. For the duration of the pandemic and beyond, we must look at ways of keeping people out of prison who do not need to be there. We should, for example, expand the categories of offences for which an adult caution is an adequate punishment, including for minor drugs offences. The Minister of State referred in his contribution to the juvenile diversion scheme. Given the massive disadvantages of having a conviction for a minor drugs offence, consideration might be given to allowing local superintendents to apply the adult caution scheme in such instances, as was previously allowed to be done, in order that people do not have to go to court. As everybody knows, if one is travelling to the US, the question asked is not whether one has a conviction for a minor drugs offence but whether one has ever been charged with such an offence. That has huge consequences for people down the line. We also need to look at a proper system of accountability within the prison system. As I said to the Minister at yesterday's meeting of the Select Committee on Justice, the remit of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is supposed to have been extended to include prisons but it has not happened yet. That should be examined together with a prisons inspectorate that is independent of the Minister. I also said at the meeting yesterday that there has been a 60% increase in the use of video links for court appearances. In the same way that the Garda fleet has been expanded, consideration should be given to an increase in the number of prison vehicles. Finally, the Minister mentioned the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. I ask that the implementation of its recommendations be expedited, if possible. Another issue to consider is the small number of paramilitary prisoners - I understand there are 28 - being detained in Portlaoise Prison at huge cost. Maybe talks could take place. Sometimes a couple of hundred prison officers in total have to guard those prisoners. Perhaps talks could take place with a view to reducing the cost to the State of having to guard them.	spk_243

In the course of a conversation with a constituent last week, I learned that it was 100 years ago, last Wednesday, since the Black and Tans had burned her grandfather’s creamery. He had to go on the run, leaving his family, with the price of £1,000 on his head. Afterwards, I received a message from her saying that her grandparents were committed to a republic, a better world, equality of access to education and employment and their democratic right to vote. She mentioned equality of access. For these just rights, she said, they risked their livelihoods and their lives. Are we, as Teachtaí Dála, staying true to this legacy? Spin will not paper over these cracks. Are we now going to deliver a vote of confidence in this Tánaiste in the light of the leaking of confidential information which has been well discussed? We know the Tánaiste believes that every Member of this House routinely leaks information and that a culture of spin and calculated leaks is completely acceptable. We remember the promise of the so-called democratic revolution of former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, but our lot was a bank bailout and the continued prosperity of the well-heeled, the golden circle. Who benefits from this type of cronyism? It is banks, the insurance industry and Fine Gael’s friends. What fate is in store for those who are not well-connected? Weeks ago, we had the survivors of mother and baby homes being ignored and dismissed by this very Government, whereas those who know the Tánaiste personally get confidential documents posted to them without question. It shows the insidious nature of insider politics. This, as the phrase in Kerry goes, leads to “daoine atá fágtha in áit na leathphingine”, those who are neglected or left behind. That seems to be the fate of rural Ireland with this Tánaiste and his party. Can people in rural Ireland enter the golden circle, the prism of privilege, the fortress of the favoured? School secretaries, who have no pension or job security and are on a two-tier pay scale, certainly cannot enter. I know one school secretary who worked for 28 years under these conditions. These secretaries were promised help but were then told that to help would be to open the floodgates. The Debenhams workers I saw in Tralee at the weekend certainly cannot enter. They are maintaining their vigil through the November nights with their hopes of assistance from Fine Gael or its partners in Government fading fast. The small inshore fishermen of the south west certainly cannot enter as they see the bays of Kerry literally being cleaned out by the larger boats following the recent High Court case.Unlike the vulture funds, there will be no rushed legislation for those who choose to maintain a family fishing tradition; certainly not for seasonal workers, tour guides, bar staff and those in music and the arts excluded from the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP; and, finally, certainly not for those who live off the main roads of rural Ireland who cannot access broadband after the populous areas were carved up by the large companies and the State was again left to pick up the tab. One school in Kerry that contacted the Department of Education to complain about substandard broadband was told to contact their local representatives. Today is the 100th anniversary of the end of the Siege of Tralee when, among other events, county hall, the seat of local democracy, was burned down by occupying Black and Tans. The Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil-controlled county council does not want to talk about that event or commemorate it in any way. Maybe they are afraid that the motives of those who struggled for equality 100 years ago and remembering men like Frank Hoffman, John Cantillon and Michael Maguire would lay bare the contrast between the promise of then and the reality of now. I oppose the motion.	spk_160

The evidence is increasing that indoor, poorly-ventilated spaces pose the largest risk. I ask that the Government consider making an exception for businesses selling Christmas trees, taking into account that it is essentially an outdoor activity. 	spk_251

Pa Daly	40	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2020-11-04	dail	33	Finance Bill 2020: Second Stage	dbsect_17	Coicís ó shin, bhí mé ag caint mar gheall ar rudaí a bhí in easnamh sa bhuiséad. Leis an méid sin airgid a bhí ag an Rialtas, cheap mé nach mbeadh seans ann go dteipfeadh air ach níl an iomarca sa Bhille Airgeadais chun daoine laga agus oibrithe a chothú. Mar shampla, cuirfidh an méid cánach ar dhíosal na hiascairí cladaigh faoi bhrú. Following the recent High Court ruling, the collapse in lobster and crab prices and the increase in the price of diesel, smaller fishing boat owners will have to borrow for next year.There is nothing else in the budget for them. Carers have had an incredibly difficult time during this pandemic. There is an absence of day care services, respite nearly ground to a halt, and they had additional spending for personal protective equipment, PPE, heating, groceries and sanitiser. Many carers in Kerry spoke to me, saying that when they apply for the carer's allowance, it seems there is an automatic policy of refusal on first application. I am not sure if they are right or wrong. Carers and the people for whom they care are vulnerable and many may be older and have underlying conditions. We must do everything we can to support them. Much has been said already about the pandemic unemployment payment and making it taxable income. Dozens of my constituents are distressed because their application for the Covid-19 payment has been declined on the basis of the Department not having any recent record of PRSI contributions made by them in specific classes. Operational guidelines must be published so that people can understand this. In the previous lockdown the staff in my office in Tralee dealt with three people in the Limerick social welfare office. They were Anne, Gráinne and Jim, and I know them well. They were able to deal with things on the spot. A new email system has been set up, often taking two full weeks for us to get a reply for people who have had to go on supplementary welfare to get the Covid payment. PRSI contributions were previously not a problem, and this stinks of an attempt to reduce by any means necessary the numbers of people taking the payment. We cannot get through this pandemic on the cheap but the Finance Bill seems to try to do that. The Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, seems to have been written for one industry at the expense of another. Food suppliers in Killarney, who supply hotels and catering facilities, have contacted me as they seem to have been deliberately and precisely excluded. These are family businesses with good employees over the years and they are wondering what they ever did to upset the Department. Bizarrely, in the budget there seemed to be scope for VAT to be reduced across a broad range of goods and services delivered to NATO members and European states engaged in the EU Common Security and Defence Policy. This effectively amounts to a State subsidy for these activities, and this must be subject to proper scrutiny. It is an irony not lost on me that the effect of this Finance Bill will be to increase fuel costs for small fishermen while decreasing them for the US military.	spk_192
Pa Daly	40	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2020-11-04	dail	33	Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020: Motion	dbsect_18	I was interested to hear the recent remarks by the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, on the issue of the imposition of fines for breaking quarantining rules. He spoke about how he would prefer there to be a greater understanding of the requirements and that a well-informed and knowledgeable public is more motivated to buy into such measures. Senior representatives of An Garda Síochána have spoken in similar terms about how achieving that type of buy-in is the preferable goal in this pandemic. An issue we discussed at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response with witnesses from the Law Society and Dr. David Kenny was that the difference between what is health advice and what is the law has not always been clear. The Government is running the risk of that type of confusion continuing. In the absence of the pre-legislative scrutiny that generally applies, there has been very little time to discuss all the detailed regulations that have been introduced and all the nuances of the issues. That is not in any way desirable because we want people to be honest with contact tracers and doctors and, if they have symptoms, to declare themselves. Criminalising behaviour which is, of course, unacceptable from a public health perspective gives rise to the risk, as Dr. Holohan said, of driving people who may need testing underground. This is something that must be avoided, and that objective is the basis of our proposal for a shorter time period for these regulations. Appropriate powers and resources for An Garda Síochána will continue to be important but the public must have confidence that the Government is striking the right balance. These are extraordinary powers for extraordinary times. Without the usual pre-legislative scrutiny, they must be kept under regular review. While we support the continuation of the measures set out in this legislation, we must provide hope that their end is anticipated. Extending the legislation to next summer sends the wrong message at a time when many people are wilting under the pressure of the regulations. People in their 60s are coming to me saying they cannot go for a walk on Banna Beach. Independent retailers whose businesses have been in their family for years cannot open, despite the lack of evidence that Covid-19 is transmitted in such premises. The people of Valentia Harbour, who are supposed to be putting in any objections they might have to aquaculture licences, cannot travel outside their 5 km zone to view the proposals, which are located in Portmagee and Cahersiveen Garda stations. People's patience is running out and extending the provisions to next summer sends the wrong message. I support the amendment put forward by Deputy Martin Kenny.	spk_218
Pa Daly	40	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2020-10-23	dail	33	Health (Amendment) Bill 2020: Second Stage	dbsect_2	The tracing system is a shambles. We see the same factories that continued their non-essential work throughout lockdown now forcing workers to take holidays over the coming weeks. We are asked to vote for regulations without scrutiny. That is not acceptable. Are our hospitals now ready? A number of people within the health service have shared concerns with me. They could be described as whistleblowers. They have told me about deteriorating conditions within University Hospital Kerry, UHK. Management has been telling consultants to cancel surgeries so that beds can be kept in reserve. These patients have been tested for Covid and isolated for two weeks but then, the night before their surgery, they are told that it is cancelled. We discussed the chronic underinvestment. Theatres in UHK are outdated. Built in the 1980s, the orthopaedic unit urgently needs another theatre. No hip replacement procedures have been carried out since March and 150 patients have been sent to Bon Secours Hospital at a great cost to the State. These people have told me about the treatment of nurses. Quality staff are not being offered permanent contracts. Morale is low and communication between management and staff is poor. The acute medical assessment unit, the brainchild of one consultant that has worked very well, now accepts overflow from the emergency department and, consequently, has even fewer beds. The pathology laboratory has no pathologist, despite funding being allocated for two.  The people to whom I have spoken warn of potential disaster in the area of cancer screening. The state-of-the-art endoscopy unit at the hospital is threatened with closure. The programme is being plundered and nurses are being dispersed to the wards and, as a result, the detection rate will drop and cancers will probably go undetected. The money paid to UHK from bowel screening programmes is now being used to pay the salaries of surgeons in Cork. The funds are being diverted away from Kerry. With regard to surgery, the hospital had 70 inpatient beds, which is two full wards, and a day ward catering for 14 patients two years ago. It now has 29 inpatient beds and no day ward. The ear, nose and throat surgeon is due to retire and there are no plans to replace him. Patients in Kerry will be at risk during basic procedures such as tonsillectomies because, if complications occur, no one will be available locally to follow up. This is similar to the situation in respect of the National Treatment Purchase Fund which, apart from not representing good value of money, lacks continuity of care. Arthritis Ireland has also contacted me, as well as other Deputies, to say that the number of people waiting for rheumatology appointments increased by 26% between January and September of this year. Staff are committed to the healthcare system and have suggested solutions. In towns of a similar size such as Clonmel, modular wards have been built. In Letterkenny, another ward was installed in the car park to deal with the trolley crisis. Nurses need to be recruited on permanent contracts. Endoscopy should be considered an essential service. The unit has the capacity to perform all types of scoping procedure but it must be staffed. If the hospital in Kerry is to be officially downgraded, let the Minister state as much in the House and defend that decision. Kerry would ideally have its own stand-alone health board to prevent the hospital being downgraded. The situation is bad enough at the best of times as the county has the second oldest population in the State but, during a pandemic, this would be unconscionable. I ask the Government to reverse the cuts and to do right by the people of Kerry and the south west.	spk_24

Pa Daly	40	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2020-10-14	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 7 - General: Motion (Resumed)	dbsect_21	In the past couple of weeks, I have had a number of conversations with people in my constituency. On Tuesday, I spoke to one of the school secretaries who have a problem with their two-tier system. She has been working in a school for more than 29 years, but she will have no pension. She is laid off at the end of June every year. When the pandemic struck, however, who was expected to roll up her sleeves and help out as a front-line worker? There is nothing in this budget for her. Last Friday, I spoke to a fisherman in Dingle who had a small, family-run business and whose income was being squeezed. He is dependent on crab, lobster and crayfish, but the prices for those have dropped. Following a recent High Court ruling, larger boats are now free to sweep up inside the six-mile limit. Herring and mackerel are no longer available to them. There is nothing for that fisherman in this budget except an increase in the price of diesel. The absence of a stand-alone Minister in this Government has failed the small fisherman once again. I spoke to a woman in Killorglin whose son used to attend a day care centre for five days per week. His time has been reduced to three hours three days per week. His mother, who is a nurse in a nursing home, is now thinking about quitting her job. There are some good elements in this budget. Perhaps there will be something for her. We will wait and see. With a budget of €70.75 billion, I thought to myself that the Government could surely not fail to deliver for everyone. In a time of crisis, this was a chance for transformative change so that we could build a real republic of equals. However, I am afraid to say that the Government has not delivered. There was a chance to make nurses' pay equal. The Government failed in that. There was a chance to make young teachers' pay equal to that of their colleagues. The Government failed in that. There was a chance to reduce class sizes to a revolutionary level. The Government failed in that. The greatest issue in the run-up to the election last February was the two-tier health system. That will not change. The electorate also looked for pension certainty in that election, but it has not been provided. Low-paid workers will get an increase of 10 cent in the minimum wage. Although the local authority rates waiver will continue to the end of this year, there is no certainty going into next year. Regarding climate action, anyone who canvasses around Ireland knows that poverty in certain areas is evidenced by the amount of solid fuel or oil fuel in households. They cannot afford solar panels. There is nothing in this budget except increased costs and energy poverty for people who are already poor. Where is the action against the big polluters? There is none. There will still be a 30-month waiting list for the wind energy plan. Where is the State-run wind energy policy similar to the ones being promoted in other countries? There is none. I fear that changes will not arise out of this budget. A couple of weeks ago, the home of one of the 1916 leaders, who promoted and advocated for a real republic and real equality, was demolished.	spk_207

Dúirt mo sheanmháthair liom go raibh Gaeltacht nó breac-Ghaeltacht i nDomhnach Maighean sa chontae sin nuair a bhí sí ina cailín óg. Tá súil agam go bhfuil cúis na teanga go smior i ndearcadh an Aire. Do bhuaileas an tseachtain seo caite le Breanndán Ó Beaglaoich ó Bhaile na bPoc i gCorca Dhuibhne agus bhíomar ag plé cúrsaí teanga. Aontaím leis gur chóir go mbeadh pobal na Gaeltachta in ann cónaí lena gcomharsain sa Ghaeltacht. Tá polasaithe an Stáit dírithe ar dhaoine a bhrú isteach sna cathracha, nó sna bailte is cóngaraí dóibh ar nós An Daingean, cé go dtéann sé seo glan in aghaidh traidisiún agus meon pobal na tuaithe. Má táthar chun pobal sláintiúil a choimeád faoin tuath, caithfear tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh agus is é an ceart is bunúsaí ar fad ná an ceart atá ag gach duine maireachtaint ina cheantar dúchais. Mar atá ráite ag Breanndán Ó Beaglaoich, muna gcuirtear ina cheart an córas atá ann faoi láthair, beidh ár mhuintir a chuaigh romhainn, a d'fhág ár mbailte beaga againn mar oidhreacht, maslaithe againn agus ní mhaithfidh na glúnta atá le teacht é go deo. Ba chóir aitheantas faoi leith a thabhairt don gcainteoir dúchais atá ag iarraidh maireachtaint ina cheantar féin. Ba chóir go mbeadh Gaelainn líofa ag na pleanálaithe a bhíonn ag plé le muintir na Gaeltachta. Is sórt saoránach den dara grád é an teanga. Nuair a bhím ag tiomáint ar ais go dtí Contae Chiarraí, feicim an leagan Gaeilge scríofa níos lú ar comharthaí bóithre, cleachtas a bhriseann na rialacha a deir gur chóir an leagan Gaeilge a úsáid nuair atá na logainmneacha cosúil lena chéile i mBéarla agus i nGaeilge, áiteanna cosúil le Úlla i gContae Luimnigh, Muine Gall i gContae Uíbh Fhailí agus Mín Liatroma i gContae Chiarraí. Go dtí seo, ní rabhthas in ann m'ainm Gaeilge a úsáid agus mé ag déileáil le seirbhísí pobail. Fós níl daoine ábalta síneadh fada a úsáid agus iad ag déanamh áirithintí le Aer Lingus. Is é seo an Bille is tábhachtaí don Ghaeilge le blianta. Aontaím le sprioc an Bhille maidir le postanna sa tseirbhís poiblí. B'fhéidir go gcabhróidh sé le fostaíocht a chruthú. Aontaím freisin leis na moltaí atá curtha chun cinn ag Conradh na Gaeilge, an Coimisinéir Teanga agus pobal na Gaeilge i gcoitinne. Ba cheart don Rialtas dréachtchaighdeáin teanga a fhoilsiú sula dtagann an reachtaíocht seo ar ais os comhair na Dála, agus na leasuithe atá i gceist acu a dhéanamh ar an mBille a chur in iúl dúinn. Gan na gníomhacha seo ó thaobh an Rialtais, beidh sé deacair tacú leis an mBille ar an Dara Céim. Má dhéanann an Rialtas na rudaí seo roimh ré, b'fhéidir go mbeimid in ann tacaíocht a thabhairt don reachtaíocht ar an Dara Céim sa tsúil go ndéanfar na leasuithe cuí ar Chéim an Choiste.	spk_198

I have dealt with Safe Home Ireland, which works with older Irish emigrants in London and all over Britain. Many migrants who have returned home to Ireland find that once they are here, they experience problems accessing social welfare, dealing with the HSE and dealing with local authorities. There is inconsistency between many county councils and sometimes in the attitude in the local Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. I appreciate this is not the Minister’s area but in speaking with Crosscare, I was told the resuming residence clause and the length of purpose of absence are a problem and that there is an unfair burden of proof in obtaining a whole load of documentation. Given these inconsistencies migrants face when they come home, prior to which the Minister's staff will have done an excellent job in helping them return home, will the Minister consider establishing an Oireachtas subcommittee to deal with this so that we can have an equality between citizens returning to the country?	spk_466

Perhaps the Minister and I could have a conversation about these matters. I am aware of some cases of people who have been repatriated very quickly. There are older Irish emigrants, or people who have grown up in Irish families in England, who feel they are discriminated against when they come home, even though they are full Irish citizens, because they do not satisfy the habitual residence condition. They are sometimes waiting five or six months before they are able to access services. Their money is completely depleted and they are not on housing lists. I know of one person whose resources are exhausted and who has had to rely on a GP who gave his time for free and the local Society of St. Vincent de Paul.

I have dealt with Safe Home Ireland, which works with older Irish emigrants in London and all over Britain. Many migrants who have returned home to Ireland find that once they are here, they experience problems accessing social welfare, dealing with the HSE and dealing with local authorities. There is inconsistency between many county councils and sometimes in the attitude in the local Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. I appreciate this is not the Minister’s area but in speaking with Crosscare, I was told the resuming residence clause and the length of purpose of absence are a problem and that there is an unfair burden of proof in obtaining a whole load of documentation. Given these inconsistencies migrants face when they come home, prior to which the Minister's staff will have done an excellent job in helping them return home, will the Minister consider establishing an Oireachtas subcommittee to deal with this so that we can have an equality between citizens returning to the country?	spk_466

Perhaps my question should have been a little more specific but I was not only talking about those who were repatriated due to the situation around Covid-19. Perhaps the Minister and I could have a conversation about these matters. I am aware of some cases of people who have been repatriated very quickly. There are older Irish emigrants, or people who have grown up in Irish families in England, who feel they are discriminated against when they come home, even though they are full Irish citizens, because they do not satisfy the habitual residence condition. They are sometimes waiting five or six months before they are able to access services. Their money is completely depleted and they are not on housing lists. I know of one person whose resources are exhausted and who has had to rely on a GP who gave his time for free and the local Society of St. Vincent de Paul. Perhaps the Minister and I can talk about what can be done to help those emigrants who are returning home.	spk_469

No. 318 of 2020): Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_29	I thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn for introducing this motion. I wonder what kind of scrutiny is undertaken by the Government coalition parties when they introduce regulations such as this. In July we had a situation where, under Covid-19 legislation, a change in the law was brought about to facilitate vulture funds, which was spoken against by all Fianna Fáil Deputies in the Chamber at the time, and yet they voted the other way. Now we have a situation where the regulations opposed quite strongly by all Fianna Fáil Deputies are now being proposed by them. I wonder is there any communication between the various Government parties before items like this are brought before the House. Recently I met some inshore fishermen and we discussed the overall grim economic situation in which they find themselves. Despite Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic, adequate supports have not been put in place for these fishermen.The answer from the Government is to introduce regulations such as these on evidence that would not be sufficient for a warrant to search a person's house. This is part of an overall trend by the Executive seeking out powers that are inappropriate, ramming them through or placing them within statutory instruments so that legislators cannot effectively scrutinise them. We have seen this in terms of legislation that has gone through these Houses. Rushed law makes for bad law. The concerns of the fishing community are being ignored here. This scheme has been pushed through in a lazy way that will inevitably cause problems. I remember dealing with the courts in Kerry and time after time cases on the Circuit Court lists were put back because of rushed legislation that had been challenged in the courts, causing delays. That is probably going to happen again with this.	spk_288

I congratulate the Minister of State on his first appearance in this House. As an aside, I have spoken to him about the importance of improving Tralee Courthouse and I look forward to a longer conversation regarding keeping it in mind and in the town centre. I wish him the best of luck with that. As has been said, there are already robust and extensive anti-money laundering laws in place in Ireland and, having worked as a solicitor for a few years, I am well aware of the extensive money laundering compliance and due diligence that solicitors are obliged to undertake on an annual basis. As the Minister of State said, money laundering and financing of terrorism are global issues and a coherent global approach is needed. I submitted a parliamentary question which was answered at the beginning of the month in which I asked when this legislation would be brought forward. At the end of the response to that question, it stated: ""It is also proposed to future proof our approach, by introducing amendments, to the published Bill, that will address our obligations as a member of the Financial Actions Task Force (FATF)"". Will the Minister of State confirm that has been included?  In relation to the dark money networks, we have seen over the past couple of days the role banks and other financial institutions have played in laundering money. There is a race between tax authorities and some owners of private capital, who will seek any place to put their money to escape tax. This Bill is welcome, insofar as it recognises this by putting obligations on various new designated persons to carry out anti-money laundering administration. Allowing assets and cash to be hidden from tax authorities deepens inequality and weakens states. There is a danger that cryptocurrencies could become a new frontier in this battle. I commend the Bill's regulation of certain other relevant professions through sections 17 and 21. Only a tiny minority of people in these professions engage in untoward behaviour but it is important there is legal recourse, as I see is provided for in the Bill. The Bill increases some of the administrative obligations on credit unions but a new Act for the credit union sector is needed and better impact assessments should be carried out. Credit unions are important institutions which we should not lose. Around the country and in County Kerry, they are being forced to close or merge and the burden of regulation is one of the things that is causing this developments. In many parts of County Kerry, some credit unions are so small they cannot afford to hire extra staff to cover all the necessary regulatory requirements. If they merge, that helps to scale up their operations but it may deprive communities of a vital service. Will the Minister of State consider a proper credit union Bill? They are subject to different rules to the banks and they should be given a break at the moment.  In relation to online fraud, the Bill is welcome. There is serious evidence that online fraud is rising during the pandemic, having already been on an upward trend. In the first three months of 2020, there was an increase of 15% in fraud compared to the same period in 2019. In Kerry, fraud increased from 2018 to 2019 by 75%, according to Garda statistics. Many categories of crime decreased in Kerry, I am glad to note, but fraud increased. Cryptocurrencies are part of the growth in online fraud and An Garda Síochána must be properly resourced as recommended by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. That report states the capacity and expertise of the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau should be substantially expanded as a matter of urgency and personnel appointments in that field should be fast-tracked by the Department. Legislation alone is never enough and the Government needs to make good on its promise in the programme for Government to rapidly implement these recommendations. Overall, Sinn Féin supports this Bill, which we have called for."	spk_188

While I accept that the Tánaiste is not in the Chamber today, the workers are upset with him. They disagree with his comments that this is not a technical redundancy. They disagree with his insistence on differentiating between the Clerys situation and their situation. The workers fought successfully and insisted that the €20 million of stock belongs to the Irish company. The workers continue to be denied a fair and just settlement. The Government amendment is full of excuses but short on ideas. What talks have taken place and what efforts has the Government made to discuss this with Debenhams to ensure a just and fair settlement for the workers? Legislation is required, if not for these workers then to protect workers in the future and to prevent this reoccurring. Two reviews and an examination are not enough.

One was with vintners who had come up from Kerry, old friends from Tralee, such as Pat Creagh, whose pub has been closed for the last six months and Aidan O'Connor from the Greyhound Bar, as well as some new friends from Killarney, who had been there earlier. The other meeting I had was in the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response. Speaking with vintners and the head of the Vintners Federation of Ireland in recent weeks, they accepted that there was a need for some regulation of their industry, on the basis that there was going to be a sunset clause and, when new regulations were brought in, that they would be allowed to open some time this month. Now, they have a date. They are not completely happy but they are satisfied that they will be able to reopen. The regulations have been contradictory for months, and not only concerning pubs. I can go to an under-12s game, where there can be 50 people, but no spectators will be allowed at the Kerry county championship game this weekend between St. Brendan's and East Kerry. There have been plenty of contradictions, therefore. Pre-legislative scrutiny was waived when the regulations were brought in and regulations and legislation have been introduced at short notice. The Government has been flying kites regarding whether the Garda will be entering people's homes for communion parties, for example.  In future, as was said by Dr. David Kenny in the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response today, we should have a chance to analyse these regulations. It might be possible to use the New Zealand model to scrutinise proposed regulations. Regulations are disallowed in New Zealand and cease to have effect unless positively affirmed within ten sitting days. Some people clearly had not read the legislation and regulations which went through last week and still believed we were voting on legislation which would allow members of the Garda to enter homes. That was not the case.  This motion could lead to no regulations at all. I cannot agree with that, but the regulations to date, according to Dr. Kenny's submission, have created confusion among ""members of the public; erode[d] public trust in communication about the law; and [have been] an abuse of State power, implying a legal threat that does not exist"". That type of regulation cannot continue to exist. "	spk_233

A lot of pressure was put on him and the Minister for Justice and Equality with regard to dealing with the situation in Cahersiveen. I understand the last few residents have now been transferred from that centre. The whole area of direct provision was, however, thrown into focus again recently in connection with the Covid outbreaks in Kildare. This will continue to happen as long as the State continues to use accommodation centres which are clearly not fit for purpose. The Minister said a White Paper is due.There are also regulations which were approved of in August of last year and which, almost unbelievably, will not have legal force until January of next year. As such, there is much work to be done on it. The only way that work can be done is by it coming onto the Minister's table. I ask also what alternative accommodation will be provided.	spk_251

Pa Daly	40	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2020-09-03	dail	33	Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Bill 2020: Committee Stage	dbsect_8	In general I would be slow to agree to any additional legislation unless it is absolutely necessary and I am glad a sunset clause has been introduced in this Bill so that, in nine or ten weeks, the provisions will lapse. It seems that publicans are being singled out nationally and there is not the same rush in the media and with legislators to identify the real outbreaks over the past four or five weeks, which have been in the meat factories. The new regulations and legislation seem to have identified sporting events as an issue, despite them causing a very low rate of transmission in my county. I call on the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, to show the evidence indicating transmission arising from sporting events. As a number of previous contributors have noted, we need additional resources before additional legislation. In the 12 months to the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a serious problem with Garda resources in Killarney, particularly on a Saturday night. I call on the Minister to make available more resources in this regard. Legislation will be introduced relating to publicans. There are one or two rogue publicans who have not complied with planning legislation and have operated in parts of their premises that are not even licensed.These regulations have not been enforced. I would be surprised if this legislation is.  I can see the need for regulations. Many publicans I have spoken to have said they will go along with them for the nine-week period if it will enable them to open their premises as quickly as possible. However, I worry that enforcement will not happen in rural areas. There is already licensing and planning legislation in place. It has not been complied with, and I wonder if this will be.	spk_35
Pa Daly	40	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2020-09-02	dail	33	Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Bill 2020: Second Stage	dbsect_8	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle agus leis an Aire. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil mé ag caint mar gheall ar an Stát go léir maidir leis an reachtaíocht seo ach ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá faoi mo Dháilcheantar féin chomh maith. We are dealing with the entire State here and I want to pick up on one or two aspects of what Deputy Kenny has said. It is good to see that the courts around the country have opened up in their own District Court areas. I hope that this will continue and that we can learn from what has happened during the Covid-19 period to address the family law situation and perhaps to use Zoom for those kind of meetings so that we can get through the long lists that have developed over the past while. I am somewhat concerned on some aspects of this legislation. Having spoken to some vintners over the past few weeks they seem to be in favour of it because they have been calling for measures to be put in place so the very small amount of rogue publicans or licence holders can be dealt with and that those who have been in a limbo-type situation, particularly since 10 August, can move forward and be taken out of limbo so their businesses can reopen. In my county there are 6,000 jobs in the pub trade which is a very significant amount. Having spoken to some of them, while they are very concerned with the amendments to the wage subsidy scheme, I was reminded that not only do their pubs sometimes have mortgages but one man told me that there were three members of his family who all have mortgages. They are reliant on the business reopening. The longer this goes on without them being able to reopen there is a risk that their staff may not return and that some, particularly smaller pubs, will not reopen at all. Many pubs have been able to adapt to the situation that has prevailed over the last number of weeks by serving food where they may have never served food before. Other pubs, however, are not capable or not willing to reopen in situations where they have to charge a customer €9 plus the price of a pint. They accept there has been poor management by some licence holders but in the vast majority of them, and in some of the pubs in which I have been including the Bridge Bar in Portmagee and in Mike the Pie’s in Listowel, there is stringent adherence to all of the regulations such as contact-tracing regulations, hand sanitising etc. to the letter of the law. These businesses are already highly regulated. They are used to having a full knowledge of the legislation and to dealing with all of the regulations, even more so in this situation. They are subject to having their licences renewed every September where, if An Garda Síochána feels they are running an unruly house, it can object. They are not going to be reckless in their behaviour and they have to get a date on the door. Hopefully this legislation will allow them to move forward. As to some of the behaviour, mostly on the streets, there is already public order legislation in place. As to what happened in Killarney last weekend, public order legislation which is already in place can deal with such happenings on the street. Section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act is probably the widest power that a garda has, which is similar to the legislation before us, where a warning is given to people who are loitering on the street to move on. That legislation is there and the vast majority of publicans who are doing their best having reopened are being unfairly targeted by something which is really a public order incident. This refers tangentially to a situation in Killarney in the 12 months coming up to Covid-19, which is to ensure more gardaí are made available for the very busy Saturday nights in Killarney. People are coming on buses from all over west Limerick, west and north Cork and County Kerry, in their hundreds into the town to enjoy what Killarney has to offer. If there is another incident like last Saturday night where Garda resources were being stretched, I ask the Minister to address this by giving the Garda more resources so that people can continue to enjoy what Killarney has to offer. There must also be consistency in the messaging coming from the Government. In dealing with Covid-19 there seems to be significant inconsistency. It seems ridiculous to me that 500 people can attend a football match in Aughnacloy or in Crossmaglen whereas in the upcoming Kerry county championship semi-finals, not even family members will be able attend the game which will have players from my own club, St. Brendan’s. I echo the comments of the GAA president and ask NPHET to reveal the 50 odd cases that are related to sporting events. We need more clarity on where and how these figures were obtained. Vagueness is not helping anybody in this situation. Can the Minister through this legislation provide a date on the door for these publicans? We are going to be living with this virus for a long time to come we will have to work and be innovative around it. Publicans are ready, willing and able to do that so that we can open up the country and work towards that.	spk_104

I want to speak on certain applications in section 23 regarding criminal proceedings to be heard via live video link. This section was obviously prepared a long time ago, probably pre-Covid. I know from having worked in the criminal courts for some years that there are many cases where it is unnecessary to bring a prisoner to court. Sometimes a prisoner would agree that he or she will not have to be put into a tiny cage in the back of a van and travel for hours to a court hearing.  I have particular concerns about what will happen in indictable cases. There are cases for case management, call-overs, preliminary applications and the like, perhaps even in appellate courts sitting during Covid. I would have less of a problem with this if it was done by consent of a prisoner. If the Bill had been developed in consultation with the Bar Council or the criminal lawyers committee of the Law Society, I might have fewer concerns. Some 80% of what are perhaps unnecessary journeys could have been made by consent. I fear, however, that the real reason behind the Bill is to reduce the €17 million bill for transporting prisoners to court. It is a triumph of expediency over fairness. I agree with the summary of the report from the Library and Research Service. Fundamentally, as we know justice has to be seen to be done. There are personal freedoms in the Constitution but on a practical level in indictable cases, every case apart from murder, rape, or, perhaps, treason, can be dealt with in the Circuit Court. There are cases where people could potentially face life imprisonment, and under the provisions in the Bill they could be heard remotely or via video link without accused persons having their legal teams beside them or members of their family in court. That is fundamentally unfair. I do not know how it could be in the interests of justice or how any judge could see that it would be in the interests of justice, to allow such a thing to proceed. The report from is very good. It states, quite fairly, that the general consensus is that such hearings are better suited to civil matters and less suited to use in the Circuit and District Courts and more suited to civil courts. It goes on to state that legal professionals on the criminal side are generally resistant to engaging in this type of technology on a substantive day-to-day manner.  The report deals in quite a fair way with some of the ways the courts in England operate. The UK Civil Justice Council said that the majority of respondents felt that remote hearings were worse, half of the hearings were affected by technical difficulties and 12.9% had serious technical difficulties. That is what we are dealing with. We all remember when the Department of Justice purchased a video system for Garda stations. When everything was going digital, it purchased a CD system for the recording of interviews in Garda stations. I fear the technology will not be sufficient. Professor Anne Wallace has noted there is often a difficulty in receiving and giving non-verbal cues from other participants in the proceedings and difficulty in hearing or seeing some of the respondents. Surveys have been carried out in England which show that 67% of respondents felt there was a negative impact on the ability of defendants and their lawyers to communicate. This measure will creep into the system. It is likely to become the norm. That cannot be in the interests of justice. I submit that it is not something that Declan Costello would have agreed with or that Eamon de Valera would have introduced. The Bill is rushed, flawed and dangerous. I do not think the necessary technology is in place. It will reduce the ability of defendants to communicate in confidence with lawyers. There is a provision for 	spk_292

The Covid-19 crisis has been used as an excuse to do many good things such as the efficiencies that will be brought to the Coroners Acts. However, bringing in legislation such as the Bill about which we are speaking at the last minute to facilitate vulture funds cannot be right. I also think there is a serious problem with closing the courts in Sligo and Tralee and consolidating them in Limerick. It is not desirable to take members of An Garda Síochána out of the counties they are in and take them to a centralised location. The provision in this Bill to allow sentencing up to life imprisonment to take place in a prison, where an accused is not beside his or her legal team, is deeply flawed. I am supporting the amendment to prevent that becoming a permanent provision because it is totally unfair that someone could receive a life sentence outside a courtroom overseen by a judge.	spk_338

Pa Daly	40	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2020-07-15	dail	33	Employment Rights: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_32	It is clear that we are facing massive problems as regards the underemployed or the working poor. Many workers have contacted my office to say they are now working similar or increased hours but with no increase in pay, meaning their income in real terms has taken a serious hit even with the assistance of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS. Some employers have been unable or unwilling to top up the TWSS and there is also a problem with it in that it does not allow employers to pay more than the top-up payment. If they do that, the payment is scaled back until the employee is deemed to have come off it and appeals to Revenue have fallen on deaf ears. Seasonal workers, who already have few or no rights, were also shut out of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and full supports. The Government's amendment emphasises job creation and retention, but too often workers are asked to carry an unfair share of the burden to keep businesses open. We must implement a living wage to ensure people do not dip below the poverty line through poor pay. It is something Sinn Féin has consistently called for and it is only right and proper that it be recommended by any task force. It is telling that the Government amendment expresses gratitude to workers. Retail workers in particular have been the unsung heroes of this pandemic, but they often survive on low pay and poor conditions. The legacy of the pandemic must be the improvement of their material conditions and the defence of collective bargaining rights and workers' protection. Before I was elected, almost every time I met with a client who had a work difficulty, that person had no workplace representation. This continues in Kerry with McCauley Chemists laying people off and refusing to recognise the union.Workers have also been treated very poorly by Debenhams and Mothercare. This must change and now is the time to do it. Taking action would be appropriate as this is the weekend on which the Tolpuddle Martyrs are usually commemorated. Their struggle was the beginning of most union rights. Much has been said about the judicial decision on sectoral employment rights. Those workers have been left vulnerable and the ultimate protection will be strong legislation in this area and not just an appeal. As legislators, we must face up to this responsibility. I am interested in the possibility of remote working for people in Kerry and other rural areas, but affordable and reliable broadband is sadly lacking and the technical support from all companies, including Eir and Vodafone, is shockingly bad. A person could be left waiting half an hour. It is interesting that the Tánaiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation has been tweeting from his home while looking at his new monitor. I invite him, however, to try to do a video call from Gneevegullia or Caherdaniel and see how that works out for him.	spk_402
Pa Daly	40	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2020-07-09	dail	33	Estimates for Public Services 2020 (Resumed)	dbsect_6	Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire nua, an Teachta McEntee, agus leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta McConalogue. Tá sé soiléir go bhfuil dúshláin agus deacrachtaí nua ag baint le Covid-19 do na Ranna go léir agus don Roinn Dlí agus Cirt. Chonaic mé an tuarascáil ón Irish Human Rights Commission agus tá béim ann ar chomhionannas, cothrom na Féinne agus ceartas sóisialta a choimeád sna polasaithe sa Roinn Dlí agus Cirt i rith an pandemic. There are a number of interesting things in the Estimates. I welcome the announcement of the increase in funding for community policing vehicles and community policing works. I note with interest that funding for the witness security programme is being increased from €120,000 to nearly €1.2 million, an 800% increase. I had a question regarding prisons, given that the number of bed nights was reduced between March and May by 11%, while the Estimate seems to have increased by 9%, but the Minister, in fairness to her, answered that when she said the figures may be revised later in the year. On the matter of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, the Garda has reported a 25% rise in domestic calls since the restrictions began. Women's Aid has in turn said that the figures are probably much higher, given that many victims do not report incidents to the Garda. It is difficult to reconcile this reality with the Estimate. The Estimate envisages delivering the same numbers of domestic refuges and refuge spaces this year as were provided in 2019, with 22 refuges and 160 spaces. At the same time, funding under the financial human resource inputs heading for criminal justice, for prevention of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, has reduced by 16%. I am sure the Minister will agree that Operation Faoiseamh, which was set up by An Garda Síochána to target crimes of domestic abuse, will be fighting an uphill battle without supports for women to exit abusive relationships being in place and without prevention programmes being adequately supported. I agree with what the Minister said about the not-for-profit approach being introduced to direct provision. That is a good idea but those direct provision centres which are not fit for purpose, such as the Cahersiveen centre, should be closed now or as soon as possible. I was not sure why funding for the opinion poll from the public attitudes survey was included in the Estimates.Despite the efforts of some people to heighten fear of crime, it is noteworthy that for 64% of respondents fear of crime has no impact on quality of life. For less than 20% fear of crime is a serious problem. That being said, how do these Estimates and the programme for Government they support measure up to these moral and political imperatives?  Access to justice is a key legal principle which has often been forgotten. The Courts Service has recently taken the view that the pandemic has created particular challenges concerning the swearing in of juries for trials in the Circuit Court, particularly due to social distancing requirements. For example, in the south western circuit which covers counties Clare, Limerick and Kerry, the Courts Service has decreed that jury trials will be restricted to one location, namely, Limerick city. As a result, members of An Garda Síochána will have to spend their time travelling up and down the road to Limerick from counties Kerry and Clare. That journey is a 200 km round trip from Tralee, for example. The same applies to legal teams, leading to increased inconvenience and distress for witnesses, victims and defendants who have the presumption of innocence.  I note that the programme for Government emphasises the need to prioritise town centres. The neglect of Tralee courthouse has one silver lining, namely, that the building is near the Main Street and the loss of business to the town centre will be particularly acute this year. There are plans which are 30 years old on the wall of the current courthouse. In those 30 years, the only refurbishment has been to the judge's chambers. Even the long-awaited wheelchair lift in the plans on the wall has never been fitted. Surely the imagination to refurbish this building in a manner which fits the needs of a modern court is out there somewhere. This courthouse, designed by a 17 year old apprentice architect and quarried from limestone in the town centre, has functioned in the present location since the days of Daniel O'Connell, through the War of Independence and on to the wrongful prosecution which led to the Kerry babies tribunal. There is an abundance of underutilised space within the existing structure to provide extra courtrooms, separate entrances for juries, prisoners and judges, and possibly some flexibility for Covid compliance. Has the possibility of videoconferencing for jury selection in other venues, not only in Tralee but around the country, been explored or even considered? The will and the effort must be applied to ensure that Tralee town centre and indeed many towns in other circuits around the country are protected. Courts and Garda stations have been lost to towns and villages around the country, including seven courts in Kerry since the turn of the century. This has to be reversed. Justice has to be seen to be done and justice should be administered in local courts in local communities. There is a well-founded fear in legal, Garda and business circles that the current crisis will be used as an excuse by the Courts Service to further restrict services. This is not a request; it is a demand. Local court services must be maintained. Our friends in west Cork fought a mighty battle to save the courthouse in Skibbereen. We should remember Skibbereen, as the song goes, and the battle waged to save that courthouse. Any Government with a serious commitment to town centres should aim to maintain services in provincial towns. Imagination and hard work are necessary, but it is possible if the greater good of the community is in mind. The Estimates triple the capital expenditure amounts for courthouses. We need to spend the money allocated as soon as possible to inject jobs into the rural economy. We need to facilitate good local builders with experience to complete these projects and keep jobs local. If the current restrictions continue in some form, we should be imaginative about obtaining rooms to swear in juries rather than cancelling or restricting services. I urge the Minister to expedite these works.	spk_173
Pa Daly	40	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2020-07-07	dail	33	Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill 2020: Second Stage	dbsect_14	I would like to express my gratitude to Deputies Pearse Doherty and O'Reilly for their speeches and for their work on these issues. I support the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Reilly. Although the Bill is somewhat welcome for the expansion it will bring in the credit available to small enterprises, it remains only a smaller part of the wider picture for businesses in these difficult times. It has limitations for a number of reasons which have been raised with me by constituents in Kerry over recent weeks and months. I have heard from people in bed and breakfast establishments, family-run restaurants, hotels, and tourism-related transportation businesses across the county who are desperate for assistance to reopen their businesses. The concerns centre on three main areas. First is the fact that what is being offered is in fact a loan that must at some point be paid back. The Bill may be intended to offer an outlet for those businesses that cannot pass some of the credit risk checks of traditional lenders, but we must acknowledge that businesses are leveraging all available sources of credit and cash. A loan under the terms of this Act is unlikely to be their first source of debt as a result of the crisis. In many cases owing to the size of these businesses and the fact that many will be small traders, these are likely to be debts personally guaranteed by the business owners and operators. Many business owners in Kerry in particular have expressed anxiety and hesitancy about applying for the credit available as a result. Second, the requirements to access Covid business supports in many cases have had the effect of excluding the seasonal businesses. Established areas particularly in south and west Kerry which rely on tourism such as Annascaul, Dingle, Waterville and Killarney are feeling the brunt of the pandemic, with some being forced to remain closed for 2020 because they cannot afford to open. Others are effectively excluded from the wage subsidy scheme owing to the seasonal nature of their businesses, where workers were to commence work at the exact time or shortly after the restrictions began. More effective and flexible conditions for these businesses in terms of other supports may help them to avoid having to turn to loans such as the one the Bill provides. Third is the uncertainty surrounding the present crisis and its duration. This year, 2020, is less than half a season for many tourism operators. Revenue will be down by up to 80% for many I have spoken to, and the outlook, unfortunately, for 2021 is increasingly uncertain. Although we have seen welcome calls for Irish people to holiday at home this year, Sinn Féin's proposal for a €200 voucher to be spent on hospitality would do much to assist those wishing so to do. There will continue to be losses for businesses on the island and particularly in Kerry, the county most negatively affected by the pandemic. As we know, the total tourism loss to the county will be up to €400 million. It affects thousands of jobs, particularly for seasonal workers. Applying for loans from Microfinance Ireland requires a projection of cash flow for the next 12 months, a daunting task for anyone at the present time and doubly so for those in the tourism and hospitality sector. Accordingly, we must consider the Bill within this context and not shy away from going as far as we can in supporting small businesses. Merely expanding the amount of credit available, as the existing Bill provides, does not go far enough. As a result, I will be supporting Deputy O'Reilly's amendment which should be supported by all Members of this House who wish to provide some form of relief to the sector.	spk_189

No matter how many times the chief superintendent said that Kerry was the jewel in the crown, with much lower crime rates than everywhere else, it did not stop people from claiming otherwise. As Aneurin Bevan, MP, used to say, if one does not have a programme, a bogeyman will do. Unfortunately, we have heard some bogeymen raised today. It is the duty of An Garda Síochána to eliminate not only crime and the causes of crime, but also the fear of crime. Too often that is forgotten. We must not underestimate the importance of the lawful judgment of one's equals or the jury system in the administration of justice over the years. Juries evolved from the Magna Carta, which first acknowledged the rights of the people of England as opposed to those of the Crown. This evolved into the jury system of today. It is a necessary safeguard or bulwark against what is sometimes perceived as State oppression. As I have seen over the years, if a jury feels that something about a prosecution case is not quite right, it is entitled to throw it out. I remember Judge O'Higgins, who used to operate on the south-western Circuit Court, taking off his peruke, throwing it over to the jury and telling its members that it was up to them to make the decision. It is not a decision that juries take lightly.  Military courts were introduced in Ireland in 1939 and expanded in controversial circumstances in 1972. The Government asserted, as it was required to do under the Constitution, that the ordinary courts were ineffective to secure the proper administration of justice. The bogeyman of jury intimidation was raised. Jury intimidation is the Irish criminal justice system's equivalent to weapons of mass destruction. It is very easy to raise the issue, but where is the evidence for it? Is it in any of these reports? Has it ever been mentioned? Most of the Limerick gangland cases and many of the Crumlin and Drimnagh gang cases were dealt with by juries. Is there any evidence of intimidation leading a jury to acquit somebody? I have not seen it. If there was any evidence of jury intimidation, it could form part of the proposed review, but there does not seem to be any. In 2014, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission said there were no data to support the view that the ordinary courts were ineffective. In my view, to say so is to do a disservice to An Garda Síochána, the courts, the judges and the members of the public who sit on juries. Gardaí need resources rather than hyperbole. Over the years, there has been a creeping expansion of non-jury trials. The UN special rapporteur has said that the seepage of exceptional emergency measures into the ordinary had become the norm and that these practices had not served the rule of law or the protection of human rights. The UN Human Rights Committee previously stated that the continued existence of the Special Criminal Court was not justified. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties and Amnesty International have called on successive Governments to abolish it. As we have already heard, the committee under Mr. Justice Anthony Hederman found that a pressing case to abandon the jury trial had not been made. Speaking from a local point of view, any review of the courts should review the many District Courts that have been closed over the years. This century in Kerry alone we have lost at least six local courts. Someone who receives a summons for an offence in Castlemaine has to go to all the way to Cahersiveen to go to court. I hope the Covid-19 crisis is not used by the Courts Service to close more courts or to further restrict facilities, particularly the courthouse in Tralee.  Turning to the contents of the motion, I note that many of the provisions of the legislation are not used. Section 6 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 has been used twice in 20 years. Section 9 is routinely used in the ordinary courts and does nothing to prevent the intimidation of witnesses. That can happen anyway. It has nothing to do with whether a case takes place in the Special Criminal Court or in any other court.  Section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 states that the ordinary courts are inadequate to deal with certain provisions, including section 71A of the Criminal Justice Act 2006. That case is almost impossible to prove and is rarely used. I accept that section 72 of the 2006 Act is essential in the battle against organised crime, but the ordinary courts should be perfectly capable of dealing with it. The same is true for sections 73 and 76. Regarding the review which I am glad to note the Minister has proposed, the Oireachtas deserves better than a six-page report which was sent the day before yesterday in the expectation that this legislation would be rubber-stamped. The report repeats what the Garda Commissioner has told the Minister. There is no assessment or critical oversight by an independent body. There is no chance to discuss the issue before the Committee on Justice and Equality.This will have to change in any review, especially when such rights as the right to silence are concerned and when the powers to keep citizens detained in Garda stations for longer periods are being extended. The review will have to be comprehensive and we should at least make some effort to reduce the need for non-jury courts. We could consider, for example, screening juries and locating them in other rooms. We have neglected over the years to consider any types of intermediate measures whatsoever. Instead, we have gone for the nuclear option. Under the current law, the Director of Public Prosecutions has total discretion. He or she should be required to provide objective reasons that a case is being sent to a non-jury court. We have a situation where two people could be charged with the same offence but one goes to the Special Criminal Court while the other is sent to the ordinary courts. The evidence for such decisions, rather than being a matter of speculation, should be provided to the defence and the court. In England, one has to make an application to a judge for a non-jury trial. That application may be made in private but it must be done before a High Court judge. We need something like that in this State. There must be a review of the legislation after all these years.	spk_22
Pa Daly	40	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2020-05-06	dail	33	Covid-19 (Tourism): Statements	dbsect_5	The economy in Kerry and along the Wild Atlantic Way has been destroyed by Covid-19. Disadvantaged by peripherality, Kerry is more dependent on tourism than any other county. In every category of the Southern Regional Assembly and the Covid-19 Regional Economic Analysis published yesterday, Kerry presents as the county worst affected by the crisis. Nationally, tourism employs more than 300,000 and contributes €2 billion to the coffers. In 2019, 11 million visitors came to Ireland. Two-thirds of visitors to Kerry are international. This market has disappeared. By and large, the tourism industry consists of businesses that pay VAT at 13.5%, purchase school uniforms for children and pay registration fees and rent for students. More than 14,000, or 20%, of jobs in Kerry are tourism related, the majority of them in hotels and accommodation in a tourist season which has been carefully crafted over many years. As previously stated, tourism is worth more than €650 million to Kerry. The current crisis could cost the county half a billion euro. In the town of Killarney the loss could be in the region of €300 million. The towns of Dingle, Kenmare and Killarney are among the top 11 Irish towns most exposed to significant economic disruption. Domestically, the social fabric of County Kerry has been torn to shreds. The staples of its summer season, including Listowel Writers' Week, a possible Munster final, Puck Fair and the Rose of Tralee have all been cancelled. The concerts, the colour and all events have been obliterated. Kerry County Council, which advises on grant aid and start-up through its excellent local enterprise office, LEO, and helps businesses to adapt and survive, is the driving force and chief sponsor of many festivals. It is planning a series of greenways that will be the envy of the world, from Kilmorna to Ballyroe, Tralee to Fenit, Glenbeigh to Renard and the Big River Walkway in Tralee town. These will be walkways for tourists and locals alike. The county council is anticipated to face a budget shortfall this year of €25 million, almost 20% of its annual budget. Crisis meetings are taking place, probably as we speak, to avoid near bankruptcy of Kerry County Council. The required matched funding of 25% for vital projects such as the Tralee-Fenit greenway, the urban regeneration and development funding for Tralee town centre, and the redevelopment of the old Denny site, is now in danger. The long-term effects of this crisis cannot be overstated. The small family-run hotels, restaurants and town centre businesses in the west, which are the backbone of the economy, are totally deflated. Recent start-ups and coffee shops, retail outlets and bars may not reopen, and the greyhound stadium is closed. I ask the Minister if State, if social distancing can be properly observed, to consider an earlier opening for the greyhound stadium. Ó Chuas an Chaisleáin go dtí an Caladh-Portmagee, ón gCoireán in Waterville suas go dtí Corca Dhuibhne in iarthar Chiarraí, suas go dtí Baile an Bhuinneánaigh, tá toradh Covid-19 i bhfad níos measa in áiteanna atá ag fulaingt leis an iompar poiblí is measa in Éirinn. Ní bheidh na hoibrithe séasúracha taobh amuigh den scéim PUP, pandemic unemployment payment, in ann stampa a chur suas le haghaidh a gcuid saoire agus ní bheidh siad in ann cíos nó a dtáillí coláiste a fháil. Tá formhór na hoibrithe sna hóstáin agus sna tithe tábhairne sa chaoi chéanna ó bhliain go bliain agus dá bharr sin ba chóir go gcuirfeadh an Rialtas iad sa scéim nua PUP. Is cinnte go leanfaidh an damáiste seo ar aghaidh. Unless drastic action is taken, this damage will continue and it will be 2022 before a full recovery is realised. The seasonal worker, the short-term leaseholder and the start-up are uniting and demanding that the tourism sector be supported. While I welcome the Government aid package, two-thirds of it is reserved for medium and large enterprises with 250-plus employees. Most of it will not apply to small business. The restart fund targeting micro and small businesses, which are the backbone of the economy, is crucial. The finer details of the scheme will no doubt be developed by the relevant Departments in the coming weeks but, to me, it seems totally inadequate. We must provide employment grants in the form of wage subsidies so that workers will be paid and the industry can survive. Grants for Covid-19 required infrastructure must be considered. Domestic holidays must be incentivised, perhaps by way of a voucher scheme. While the commercial rates rebate or waiver is welcome, a three-month rebate is not enough. The local authorities, particularly in Kerry, must be subsidised by way of a vastly increased subvention. I ask the Minister of State to commit to an increased subvention for Kerry County Council or a waiving of the matched funding requirements so these vital walkways and greenways can be put through. Tasked with the job of creating employment in a county where IDA investment is not as large as in other counties, the council should not be shackled by continued lack of funding. Some funding must also be reserved for the self-employed, similar to the scheme introduced in Stormont by the Minister, Conor Murphy, for the self-employed and those working from home, who have no history of a rates base. Inshore fishermen should also be facilitated within the recent scheme. The rebates, however, cannot be entirely State-led and insurance companies which, not surprisingly, have behaved as badly as some landlords in this crisis, must provide refunds on at least a  Only a fair scheme prioritising the interests and rights of cleaners, bar staff, tour guides, coffee shop employees and bus drivers will do in a county which was the birthplace of the great Mike Quill, the union leader. The interests of the workers and workers' families must be the priority. 	spk_64
Pa Daly	40	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2020-03-19	dail	33	Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Bill 2020: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_11	"The term ""medical officer"" should be clearly defined for the avoidance of any doubt. I state that because serious powers are being invested in him or her. A draft order should also be provided for the medical officer to sign and it should be a uniform order. The terms of the order should be included in any annex or Schedule or in the regulations. The regulations should also provide that a detainee must be informed of his or her right to request a review of the detention under section 38A(6). It is unfortunate, but experience tells me the medical officer should have reasonable grounds to detain, as the Minister outlined in his speech, rather than what is in the legislation regarding operating in good faith. This is a simple protection that will ensure the medical officer has a basis for his or her view and he or she exercises it in a proportionate manner."	spk_88
Pa Daly	40	Unknown	Kerry	#PaDaly	2020-03-19	dail	33	Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Bill 2020: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_11	We live in a country where there was a misuse of sectional guidelines with regard to mental health facilities and children's homes down through the years. There is a potential lack of proportionality in what is proposed. All I can do is highlight my experience in regard to the drug trafficking legislation. As a young solicitor in the courts in the Bridewell the first client I met was not a drug baron. Rather, it was a young single mother who was living in a hostel who was going to be detained for seven days. Many said that would not happen. We have a duty to get this right now so as to prevent a deluge of applications challenging unconstitutional detentions in the High Court. I think we should stick to the original date in May of this year and not November and so on. While I welcome that there is a sunset clause, it allows the Minister to extend the provisions which would then require the Houses of the Oireachtas to annul it within 21 days. It seems to me that this is a poor sunset clause. It does not provide for proper parliamentary oversight and it is open to constitutional difficulties. There are other examples of sunset clauses in other legislation that we should examine.	spk_178
