He previously served asMinister of State for Law Reformfrom July 2020 to September 2020.[2]Early life[edit]McConalogue has a degree in economics, politics and history fromUniversity College Dublin(UCD), which he completed after a year as Education Officer in theUCD Students' Union. After graduation, he worked as a political organiser at the Fianna F\u00e1il HQ in Dublin. Upon the death of his father, he returned home to manage the family farm nearCarndonaghin the north ofInishowen,County Donegal.[3]He was raised nearGleneely,[4]a village in the north of Inishowen, and was in Australia before returning to the farm. He is married with two sons.[5]Political career[edit]McConalogue met with US Agriculture SecretaryTom VilsackinWashington, D.C.in April 2022.McConalogue was elected toDonegal County Councilat the2009 local electionsto represent the Inishowen local electoral area.[6]AfterJim McDaid's retirement andNiall Blaney's decision to step down from politics for personal reasons, Fianna F\u00e1il had no sitting TD in Donegal North-East to contest the2011 general election. The party chose McConalogue as Fianna F\u00e1il's sole candidate for the constituency.In the election, he won 17.4% of the first-preference vote and was elected on the 9th count to fill the third and final seat, behindSinn F\u00e9in'sP\u00e1draig Mac LochlainnandFine Gael'sJoe McHugh.[7]He was the Fianna F\u00e1il spokesperson on Children from April 2011 to July 2012. In July 2012, he was appointed as party spokesperson on Education and Skills.In the 2016 general election, after a redrawing of constituency boundaries, McConalogue ran alongsidePat \"the Cope\" Gallagheras one of two Fianna F\u00e1il candidates in the new five-seater Donegal constituency. McConalogue topped the poll and was elected on the first count.[8]He represented Fianna F\u00e1il intalks on government formationin 2016.[9]On 1 July 2020, McConalogue was appointed as aMinister of State at the Department of Justicewith responsibility for law reform.[10]On 2 September that year, he was appointed as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, with the vacancy having arisen following theOireachtas Golf Society scandal.[11]It emerged in December 2020 that McConalogue had tested positive forCOVID-19after returning from Brussels on 17 December, prompting all ministers in the Government to restrict their movements. The initial result was negative. He went shopping in Dublin hours ahead of a scheduled five-day follow-up COVID-19 test which led to the positive result he received on 23 December. He displayed no symptoms and isolated in his native Donegal.[12][13]McConalogue had been due to travel to Canada for St Patrick's Day in March 2022. However, he later confirmed that a positive COVID-19 test had prevented him from doing so. His period of isolation elapsed in time for him to sit on the \"VIP lorry\" at the parade inBuncrana.[14]On 17 December 2022, he was re-appointed to the same position following Leo Varadkar's appointment as Taoiseach.[15]References[edit]^Tim Ryan (2020).Nealon's Guide to the 33rd D\u00e1il and 26th Seanad and the 2019 Local and European Elections.
