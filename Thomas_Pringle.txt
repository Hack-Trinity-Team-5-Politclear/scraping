His father, Peter, was a supporter of theIrish Republican Socialist Party(IRSP), and was convicted of thekilling of two members of the Garda\u00edin 1980, a conviction that was subsequently declared as unsafe, although it has not been certified as a miscarriage of justice.[4]He is a patron of thePeople's Movement,[5]which campaigned against theLisbon Treaty. He previously worked forDonegal County Council, where he managed a water treatment plant and was a shop steward.[6]Pringle is married and has three children.[7]Pringle was previously a member of Donegal County Council, having been elected as an independent member in1999, and then as aSinn F\u00e9incandidate in2004. He left Sinn F\u00e9in in 2007, and retained his seat as an independent in2009.[8]D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (2011\u2013present)[edit]Pringle was elected as aTDfor theDonegal South-Westconstituency at the2011 general election, unseating the incumbentT\u00e1naisteMary Coughlan.[9]He quickly became an ally ofLuke 'Ming' Flanagan, elected as an independent TD at the same time as Pringle, but for theRoscommon\u2013South Leitrimconstituency. Flanagan and Pringle would go on to support each other on many issues, including reform of theCommon Agricultural Policy(CAP) and opposition to theMERCOSURdeal.[10]Even when Flanagan was elected as anMEPfor theMidlands\u2013North-Westconstituency after spending three years in the D\u00e1il, himself and Pringle continued to work together, and Flanagan visited Donegal to canvass for Pringle ahead of the2020 general election.[10]On 5 December 2011, Pringle delivered a televised address to the nation, representing thetechnical groupof TDs in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. He did so in response toTaoiseach Enda Kenny's Address to the nationof the previous evening.[11]Later that month, Pringle called on people for support in a campaign not to pay a new household charge brought in as part of the latest austerity budget, and announced that he would not register for the tax or pay it.[12][13][14]In February 2012, he published his expenses online.[15]He was elected leader of theTechnical groupinD\u00e1il \u00c9ireannin March 2012.[16]In May 2012, Pringle brought an unsuccessfulHigh Courtchallenge over the2012 European Fiscal Compact referendumand[17]the ESM Treaty which was appealed to theSupreme Courtin July 2012. In July 2012, the Irish Supreme Court decided to refer three questions to theCourt of Justice of the European Unionarising out of his challenge of the European Stability Mechanism Treaty and doubts about the ESM's legality under the Treaties of the European Union. The CJEU held an oral hearing on the referral on 23 October 2012. It was the first time that the full court sat to hear a reference from a member state of the Union. The 27 judges heard oral arguments from the counsel for Pringle, Ireland, nine other member states, the Commission, the Council, and the European Parliament. On 27 November 2012, the EU Court of Justice dismissed of Pringle's arguments and ruled that the ESM was in accordance with the Treaties.[18]In the2016 general election, after a re-drawing of constituency boundaries, Pringle campaigned in the new five-seaterDonegalconstituency. He was re-elected to the final seat by a margin of just 184 votes over Sinn F\u00e9in'sP\u00e1draig Mac Lochlainn.[19]Duringnegotiations to form a government, Pringle said he was glad not to have signed up to theIndependent Alliance, after that group entered talks withTaoiseachEnda Kenny. Pringle said that unless Kenny or Fianna F\u00e1il leaderMiche\u00e1l Martinsigned up toRight2Change, he would not support either as Taoiseach.[20]As of April 2016, Pringle had become a member of theIndependents 4 Changetechnical group in the D\u00e1il.[21]In May 2016, Pringle introduced legislation designed to retain water in public ownership and avoid further privatisation.[22][6]Pringle put forward a bill calling on the government to end public spending from fossil fuels, which passed, making Ireland the first country to fully divest public money from fossil fuels.[10]In June 2022, Pringle put forward a bill proposing a referendum on lowering the voting age to 16.[23]References[edit]^Tim Ryan (2020).Nealon's Guide to the 33rd D\u00e1il and 26th Seanad and the 2019 Local and European Elections.

Donegal and attended St Catherine\u2019s Vocational School, Killybegs and then studied Applied Biology at Letterkenny Regional Technical College (LYIT now). Shortly afterwards I emigrated to London for two years in the late 80s, but returned to Ireland where I eventually secured work in Donegal.For 17 years I worked in the Water Services of Donegal County Council (1994-2011) running the water treatment plant in Killybegs. I was one of the first 16 employees in the country to go through the pilot vocational training programme for water services workers in 1997, and trained as an assessor to assess the candidates for the vocational training in water services. I was also shop steward representing the water caretakers in Donegal County Council from 1996-1999, when I was then elected to Donegal County Council and remained a Councillor until the general election of 2011.I want Donegal to be a place where everyone will have work and choose to make their lives here.\u00a0I have a vision for where I believe we in Donegal can go and how we can achieve an economy and society that we can be proud of.\u00a0People constantly ask about local issues that will shape the next election, but our local issues are also national issues. We need to address local issues on a national stage and put in place services that benefit every community in the country.HomeAbout ThomasLatest NewsIn the NewsLocal IssuesPress ReleasesD\u00e1ilD\u00e1il CommitteesD\u00e1il DebatesD\u00e1il QuestionsNewslettersPolicyBio MassBroadbandCriminal Justice BillESC RightsContact DetailsCopyright \u00a9 2018 Thomas Pringle TD. web site by Donegal Web Sites\nThomas Pringle TD (@thomaspringle_td) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos\nThomas Pringle TD (@thomaspringle_td) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos\nProfile: Thomas Pringle (Ind) \u2013 The Irish TimesSectionsSubscribeSubscribeSubscribeHomeLatestSubscriber OnlyIrelandDublinEducationHousing & PlanningSocial AffairsStardustPoliticsPollOireachtasCommon GroundOpinionEditorialsAn Irish DiaryLettersCartoonBusinessBudget 2024EconomyFarming & FoodFinancial ServicesInnovationMarketsWorkCommercial PropertyWorldEuropeUKUSCanadaAustraliaAfricaAmericasAsia-PacificMiddle EastSportSix NationsGaelic GamesRugbySoccerGolfRacingAthleticsBoxingCyclingHockeyTennisYour MoneyPricewatchCrime & LawCourtsPropertyResidentialCommercial PropertyInteriorsFoodDrinkRecipesRestaurantsHealthYour FamilyYour FitnessYour WellnessGet RunningLife & StyleFashionBeautyFine Art & AntiquesGardeningPeopleTravelCultureArtBooksFilmMusicStageTV & RadioEnvironmentClimate CrisisTechnologyBig TechConsumer TechData & SecurityGamingScienceSpaceMediaAbroadObituariesTransportMotorsCar ReviewsListenPodcastsIn the News PodcastInside Politics PodcastThe Women's PodcastInside Business PodcastRoss O'Carroll-KellyThe Counter Ruck PodcastWeb 1.0VideoPhotographyHistoryCenturyTuarasc\u00e1ilStudent HubOffbeatCrosswords & PuzzlesCrosaireSimplexSudokuFamily Notices(Opens in new window)SponsoredAdvertising FeatureSpecial ReportsSubscriber RewardsCompetitionsWeather ForecastOireachtasProfile: Thomas Pringle (Ind)Donegal: Fifth TD elected of fiveExpandThomas PringleGerry MoriartyMon Feb 29 2016 - 17:25Thomas Pringle (48) from Killybegs, Co Donegal is an Independent left-wing politician who was first elected to the D\u00e1il in 2011.
