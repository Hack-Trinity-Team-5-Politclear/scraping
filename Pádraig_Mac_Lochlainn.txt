He was raised by his mother and grandmother for the duration of his father's imprisonment, and described them as \"two strong, loving Traveller women\".[3]After his father's release from prison in England, Mac Lochlainn then aged 10 moved with his family to his father's home ofBuncrana,County Donegaland he has lived there since. His father died in a drowning accident inShannon, County Clarein 1985.

His work as a community activist and political representative had led him to speak at conferences across Europe on the issues of unemployment, regional neglect and rural poverty.He was co-opted ontoBuncrana Town Councilin 2002. He was then subsequently elected onto Buncrana Town Council in 2004 and 2009.

As Sinn F\u00e9in's Foreign Affairs spokesperson, he strongly supported Ireland's commitment to overseas aid as evidenced in the party position paper he oversaw in early 2012, \"Honouring our Legacy: Keeping Ireland at the Heart of Global Justice\".[8]In June 2012, theIrish Independentnewspaper alleged that Mac Lochlainn and his party colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty had \"diverted unspent travel and accommodation expenses towards hiring part-time party workers despite these expenses being supposed to be returned to the Oireachtas under rules introduced in 2010\".[9]Both Deputies were subsequently found not to have broken any Oireachtas rules.[10][11]In December 2012, Mac Lochlainn was suspended from the D\u00e1il after he accused theCeann ComhairleSe\u00e1n Barrettof \"double standards and hypocrisy\".[12][13]In early 2013, he published a bill (The Reform of Judicial Appointments Procedures Bill 2013) seeking to end the system of political appointees being made judges in Ireland.[14]At the2016 general election, Mac Lochlainn ran as one of three Sinn F\u00e9in candidates in the new five-seaterDonegalconstituency.
